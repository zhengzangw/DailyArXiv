| **[Yume: An Interactive World Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17744v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Yume aims to use images, text, or videos to create an interactive, realistic, and dynamic world, which allows exploration and control using peripheral devices or neural signals. In this report, we present a preview version of \method, which creates a dynamic world from an input image and allows exploration of the world using keyboard actions. To achieve this high-fidelity and interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework, which consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization, video generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First, we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion Transformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM) and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE) are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the high-quality world exploration dataset \sekai to train \method, and it achieves remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and model weights are available on https://github.com/stdstu12/YUME. Yume will update monthly to achieve its original goal.

| **[Towards Generalist Robot Learning from Internet Video: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19664v5)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling deep learning to massive and diverse internet data has driven remarkable breakthroughs in domains such as video generation and natural language processing. Robot learning, however, has thus far failed to replicate this success and remains constrained by a scarcity of available data. Learning from videos (LfV) methods aim to address this data bottleneck by augmenting traditional robot data with large-scale internet video. This video data provides foundational information regarding physical dynamics, behaviours, and tasks, and can be highly informative for general-purpose robots. This survey systematically examines the emerging field of LfV. We first outline essential concepts, including detailing fundamental LfV challenges such as distribution shift and missing action labels in video data. Next, we comprehensively review current methods for extracting knowledge from large-scale internet video, overcoming LfV challenges, and improving robot learning through video-informed training. The survey concludes with a critical discussion of future opportunities. Here, we emphasize the need for scalable foundation model approaches that can leverage the full range of available internet video and enhance the learning of robot policies and dynamics models. Overall, the survey aims to inform and catalyse future LfV research, driving progress towards general-purpose robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[EndoGen: Conditional Autoregressive Endoscopic Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17388v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endoscopic video generation is crucial for advancing medical imaging and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. However, prior efforts in this field have either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation.

| **[Qffusion: Controllable Portrait Video Editing via Quadrant-Grid Attention Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06438v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Qffusion, a dual-frame-guided framework for portrait video editing. Specifically, we consider a design principle of ``animation for editing'', and train Qffusion as a general animation framework from two still reference images while we can use it for portrait video editing easily by applying modified start and end frames as references during inference. Leveraging the powerful generative power of Stable Diffusion, we propose a Quadrant-grid Arrangement (QGA) scheme for latent re-arrangement, which arranges the latent codes of two reference images and that of four facial conditions into a four-grid fashion, separately. Then, we fuse features of these two modalities and use self-attention for both appearance and temporal learning, where representations at different times are jointly modeled under QGA. Our Qffusion can achieve stable video editing without additional networks or complex training stages, where only the input format of Stable Diffusion is modified. Further, we propose a Quadrant-grid Propagation (QGP) inference strategy, which enjoys a unique advantage on stable arbitrary-length video generation by processing reference and condition frames recursively. Through extensive experiments, Qffusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on portrait video editing. Project page: https://qffusion.github.io/page/.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Human-Activity AGV Quality Assessment: A Benchmark Dataset and an Objective Evaluation Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16619v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven video generation techniques have made significant progress in recent years. However, AI-generated videos (AGVs) involving human activities often exhibit substantial visual and semantic distortions, hindering the practical application of video generation technologies in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we conduct a pioneering study on human activity AGV quality assessment, focusing on visual quality evaluation and the identification of semantic distortions. First, we construct the AI-Generated Human activity Video Quality Assessment (Human-AGVQA) dataset, consisting of 6,000 AGVs derived from 15 popular text-to-video (T2V) models using 400 text prompts that describe diverse human activities. We conduct a subjective study to evaluate the human appearance quality, action continuity quality, and overall video quality of AGVs, and identify semantic issues of human body parts. Based on Human-AGVQA, we benchmark the performance of T2V models and analyze their strengths and weaknesses in generating different categories of human activities. Second, we develop an objective evaluation metric, named AI-Generated Human activity Video Quality metric (GHVQ), to automatically analyze the quality of human activity AGVs. GHVQ systematically extracts human-focused quality features, AI-generated content-aware quality features, and temporal continuity features, making it a comprehensive and explainable quality metric for human activity AGVs. The extensive experimental results show that GHVQ outperforms existing quality metrics on the Human-AGVQA dataset by a large margin, demonstrating its efficacy in assessing the quality of human activity AGVs. The Human-AGVQA dataset and GHVQ metric will be released at https://github.com/zczhang-sjtu/GHVQ.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |
| **[MotionShot: Adaptive Motion Transfer across Arbitrary Objects for Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16310v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a reference object to a target object with significant differences in appearance or structure between them. To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot, a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments.

| **[Controllable Video Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16869v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular, the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex, multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models, analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

| **[PUSA V1.0: Surpassing Wan-I2V with $500 Training Cost by Vectorized Timestep Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16116v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep variables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work, we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency -- surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training cost (\$500 vs. $\geq$ \$100,000) and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs. $\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V) generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training. Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable, efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis, democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

| **[Can Your Model Separate Yolks with a Water Bottle? Benchmarking Physical Commonsense Understanding in Video Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15824v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation has enabled the synthesis of visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language. However, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing outputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior, and tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use, material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical plausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse state-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1) formulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated video with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer several physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect strategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based evaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas overlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured, interpretable framework for assessing physical commonsense in generative video models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TokensGen: Harnessing Condensed Tokens for Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15728v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips, extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To (Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference, an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips, reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive simulations.

| **[Conditional Video Generation for High-Efficiency Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15269v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free-Form Motion Control: Controlling the 6D Poses of Camera and Objects in Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01425v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling the movements of dynamic objects and the camera within generated videos is a meaningful yet challenging task. Due to the lack of datasets with comprehensive 6D pose annotations, existing text-to-video methods can not simultaneously control the motions of both camera and objects in 3D-aware manner, resulting in limited controllability over generated contents. To address this issue and facilitate the research in this field, we introduce a Synthetic Dataset for Free-Form Motion Control (SynFMC). The proposed SynFMC dataset includes diverse object and environment categories and covers various motion patterns according to specific rules, simulating common and complex real-world scenarios. The complete 6D pose information facilitates models learning to disentangle the motion effects from objects and the camera in a video.~To provide precise 3D-aware motion control, we further propose a method trained on SynFMC, Free-Form Motion Control (FMC). FMC can control the 6D poses of objects and camera independently or simultaneously, producing high-fidelity videos. Moreover, it is compatible with various personalized text-to-image (T2I) models for different content styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMC outperforms previous methods across multiple scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project Page: https://henghuiding.github.io/SynFMC/</p></details> |
| **[DualReal: Adaptive Joint Training for Lossless Identity-Motion Fusion in Video Customization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02192v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customized text-to-video generation with pre-trained large-scale models has recently garnered significant attention by focusing on identity and motion consistency. Existing works typically follow the isolated customized paradigm, where the subject identity or motion dynamics are customized exclusively. However, this paradigm completely ignores the intrinsic mutual constraints and synergistic interdependencies between identity and motion, resulting in identity-motion conflicts throughout the generation process that systematically degrade. To address this, we introduce DualReal, a novel framework that employs adaptive joint training to construct interdependencies between dimensions collaboratively. Specifically, DualReal is composed of two units: (1) Dual-aware Adaptation dynamically switches the training step (i.e., identity or motion), learns the current information guided by the frozen dimension prior, and employs a regularization strategy to avoid knowledge leakage; (2) StageBlender Controller leverages the denoising stages and Diffusion Transformer depths to guide different dimensions with adaptive granularity, avoiding conflicts at various stages and ultimately achieving lossless fusion of identity and motion patterns. We constructed a more comprehensive evaluation benchmark than existing methods. The experimental results show that DualReal improves CLIP-I and DINO-I metrics by 21.7% and 31.8% on average, and achieves top performance on nearly all motion metrics.

Most recent studies have focused on reconstructing static images from EEG recordings. In this work, we propose a framework to reconstruct dynamic visual stimuli from EEG data and conduct an in-depth study of the information encoded in EEG signals. Our approach first trains a feature extraction network using a triplet-based contrastive learning strategy within an EEG-video generation framework. The extracted EEG features are then used for video synthesis with a modified StyleGAN-ADA, which incorporates temporal information as conditioning. Additionally, we analyze how different brain regions contribute to processing dynamic visual stimuli. Through several empirical studies, we evaluate the effectiveness of our framework and investigate how much dynamic visual information can be inferred from EEG signals. The inferences we derive through our extensive studies would be of immense value to future research on extracting visual dynamics from EEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[BusterX++: Towards Unified Cross-Modal AI-Generated Content Detection and Explanation with MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14632v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Weather Synthesis and Removal with Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00704v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic and controllable weather effects in videos is valuable for many applications. Physics-based weather simulation requires precise reconstructions that are hard to scale to in-the-wild videos, while current video editing often lacks realism and control. In this work, we introduce WeatherWeaver, a video diffusion model that synthesizes diverse weather effects -- including rain, snow, fog, and clouds -- directly into any input video without the need for 3D modeling. Our model provides precise control over weather effect intensity and supports blending various weather types, ensuring both realism and adaptability. To overcome the scarcity of paired training data, we propose a novel data strategy combining synthetic videos, generative image editing, and auto-labeled real-world videos. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in weather simulation and removal, providing high-quality, physically plausible, and scene-identity-preserving results over various real-world videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025, Project Website: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/WeatherWeaver/</p></details> |
| **[SimpleGVR: A Simple Baseline for Latent-Cascaded Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19838v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage available at https://simplegvr.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[PosePilot: Steering Camera Pose for Generative World Models with Self-supervised Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01729v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) systems have highlighted the potential of world models in achieving robust and generalizable performance across both ordinary and challenging driving conditions. However, a key challenge remains: precise and flexible camera pose control, which is crucial for accurate viewpoint transformation and realistic simulation of scene dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PosePilot, a lightweight yet powerful framework that significantly enhances camera pose controllability in generative world models. Drawing inspiration from self-supervised depth estimation, PosePilot leverages structure-from-motion principles to establish a tight coupling between camera pose and video generation. Specifically, we incorporate self-supervised depth and pose readouts, allowing the model to infer depth and relative camera motion directly from video sequences. These outputs drive pose-aware frame warping, guided by a photometric warping loss that enforces geometric consistency across synthesized frames. To further refine camera pose estimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss, improving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot significantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both diffusion-based and auto-regressive world models. By steering camera pose with self-supervised depth, PosePilot sets a new benchmark for pose controllability, enabling physically consistent, reliable viewpoint synthesis in generative world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/RSJ IROS 2025</p></details> |

However, the quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs). By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold, NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score, human evaluation score) and visual quality drop.

In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on mobile devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, their ability to accurately simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency. Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050 curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.</p></details> | 31 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Leveraging Pre-Trained Visual Models for AI-Generated Video Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13224v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation, ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes, creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training, and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.

While prior efforts -- such as sparse attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jiangjiaxiu.github.io/lovic/</p></details> |
| **[World Model-Based End-to-End Scene Generation for Accident Anticipation in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12762v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators, effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise. Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[NarrLV: Towards a Comprehensive Narrative-Centric Evaluation for Long Video Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11245v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://amap-ml.github.io/NarrLV-Website/</p></details> |

While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur, temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization. Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy. Meanwhile, a motion consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS inference speed.

This task presents challenges due to the significant one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image, predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while generalizing across speakers and contexts.

One particularly challenging case is the class of videos in which the intricate motion of the hand coupled with a mostly stable and otherwise distracting environment is necessary to convey the execution of some complex action and its effects. To address these challenges, we introduce a new method for video generation that focuses on hand-centric actions. Our diffusion-based method incorporates two distinct innovations. First, we propose an automatic method to generate the motion area -- the region in the video in which the detailed activities occur -- guided by both the visual context and the action text prompt, rather than assuming this region can be provided manually as is now commonplace. Second, we introduce a critical Hand Refinement Loss to guide the diffusion model to focus on smooth and consistent hand poses. We evaluate our method on challenging augmented datasets based on EpicKitchens and Ego4D, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of action clarity, especially of the hand motion in the target region, across diverse environments and actions.

In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several trajectory inference techniques under the framework of gradient flow matching, providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts, where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

However, they also introduce significant usability challenges, as users often struggle to provide precise camera parameters when working with arbitrary real-world images without knowledge of their depth nor scene scale. To address these real-world application issues, we propose RealCam-I2V, a novel diffusion-based video generation framework that integrates monocular metric depth estimation to establish 3D scene reconstruction in a preprocessing step. During training, the reconstructed 3D scene enables scaling camera parameters from relative to metric scales, ensuring compatibility and scale consistency across diverse real-world images. In inference, RealCam-I2V offers an intuitive interface where users can precisely draw camera trajectories by dragging within the 3D scene. To further enhance precise camera control and scene consistency, we propose scene-constrained noise shaping, which shapes high-level noise and also allows the framework to maintain dynamic and coherent video generation in lower noise stages. RealCam-I2V achieves significant improvements in controllability and video quality on the RealEstate10K and out-of-domain images. We further enables applications like camera-controlled looping video generation and generative frame interpolation.

The core of these capabilities lies in powerful pre-trained foundation models, trained on large-scale, high-quality datasets. However, many advanced methods rely on in-house data subject to various constraints, and other current studies fail to generate high-resolution face videos, which is mainly attributed to the significant lack of large-scale, high-quality face video datasets. In this paper, we introduce a human face video dataset, \textbf{DH-FaceVid-1K}. Our collection spans 1,200 hours in total, encompassing 270,043 video clips from over 20,000 individuals. Each sample includes corresponding speech audio, facial keypoints, and text annotations. Compared to other publicly available datasets, ours distinguishes itself through its multi-ethnic coverage and high-quality, comprehensive individual attributes. We establish multiple face video generation models supporting tasks such as text-to-video and image-to-video generation. In addition, we develop comprehensive benchmarks to validate the scaling law when using different proportions of proposed dataset. Our primary aim is to contribute a face video dataset, particularly addressing the underrepresentation of Asian faces in existing curated datasets and thereby enriching the global spectrum of face-centric data and mitigating demographic biases. \textbf{Project Page:} https://luna-ai-lab.github.io/DH-FaceVid-1K/</p></details> |  |

Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines.

Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding.

While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose $I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that $I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

| **[Taming generative video models for zero-shot optical flow extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09082v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem. Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm, which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture. Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://neuroailab.github.io/projects/kl_tracing</p></details> |
| **[Lumos-1: On Autoregressive Video Generation from a Unified Model Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08801v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality. Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

As its core, we introduce a unified transformer-diffusion framework, featuring an autoregressive transformer model that synthesize extended and music-synchronized token sequences for 2D body, head and hands poses, which then guide a diffusion model to produce coherent and realistic dance video frames. Unlike traditional methods that primarily generate human motion in 3D, X-Dancer addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by modeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, capturing their nuanced alignment with musical beats through readily available monocular videos. To achieve this, we first build a spatially compositional token representation from 2D human pose labels associated with keypoint confidences, encoding both large articulated body movements (e.g., upper and lower body) and fine-grained motions (e.g., head and hands). We then design a music-to-motion transformer model that autoregressively generates music-aligned dance pose token sequences, incorporating global attention to both musical style and prior motion context. Finally we leverage a diffusion backbone to animate the reference image with these synthesized pose tokens through AdaIN, forming a fully differentiable end-to-end framework. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Dancer is able to produce both diverse and characterized dance videos, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods in term of diversity, expressiveness and realism.

However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods.

However, this task poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data, synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally, camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel environments.

| **[Scaling RL to Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are available at https://github.com/NVlabs/Long-RL</p></details> |

Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we present several challenging future research directions which may contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Similar results have previously been achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://v-mem.github.io</p></details> |

Current methods require multi-view videos for fluid reconstruction. We present FluidNexus, a novel framework that bridges video generation and physics simulation to tackle this task. Our key insight is to synthesize multiple novel-view videos as references for reconstruction. FluidNexus consists of two key components: (1) a novel-view video synthesizer that combines frame-wise view synthesis with video diffusion refinement for generating realistic videos, and (2) a physics-integrated particle representation coupling differentiable simulation and rendering to simultaneously facilitate 3D fluid reconstruction and prediction. To evaluate our approach, we collect two new real-world fluid datasets featuring textured backgrounds and object interactions. Our method enables dynamic novel view synthesis, future prediction, and interaction simulation from a single fluid video.

Furthermore, videos exceeding 16 seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their architectural designs and performance characteristics.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their popularity, these models rely on user-provided text and image prompts, and there is currently no dedicated dataset for studying these prompts. In this paper, we introduce TIP-I2V, the first large-scale dataset of over 1.70 million unique user-provided Text and Image Prompts specifically for Image-to-Video generation. Additionally, we provide the corresponding generated videos from five state-of-the-art image-to-video models. We begin by outlining the time-consuming and costly process of curating this large-scale dataset. Next, we compare TIP-I2V to two popular prompt datasets, VidProM (text-to-video) and DiffusionDB (text-to-image), highlighting differences in both basic and semantic information. This dataset enables advancements in image-to-video research. For instance, to develop better models, researchers can use the prompts in TIP-I2V to analyze user preferences and evaluate the multi-dimensional performance of their trained models; and to enhance model safety, they may focus on addressing the misinformation issue caused by image-to-video models. The new research inspired by TIP-I2V and the differences with existing datasets emphasize the importance of a specialized image-to-video prompt dataset.

Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore, automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation. Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color consistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

| **[Physics-Grounded Motion Forecasting via Equation Discovery for Trajectory-Guided Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06830v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions, our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, project page: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/OmniVideo_project/</p></details> |
| **[PromptTea: Let Prompts Tell TeaCache the Optimal Threshold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06739v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues, PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example, 2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across a range of scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCamMaster: Camera-Controlled Generative Rendering from A Single Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11647v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera control has been actively studied in text or image conditioned video generation tasks. However, altering camera trajectories of a given video remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation. It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories. The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video conditioning mechanism--its capability is often overlooked in current research. To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5, which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics, covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our method also finds promising applications in video stabilization, super-resolution, and outpainting.

In this paper, we present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

However, they often suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in both text and video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Stabilized and Efficient Diffusion Transformers through Long-Skip-Connections with Spectral Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17616v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high fidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish Long-Skip-Connections as critical architectural components for stable and efficient diffusion transformers.

Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios, providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy.

Synthesizing sustained footage (e.g. over minutes) still remains an open research question. In this paper, we propose MALT Diffusion (using Memory-Augmented Latent Transformers), a new diffusion model specialized for long video generation. MALT Diffusion (or just MALT) handles long videos by subdividing them into short segments and doing segment-level autoregressive generation. To achieve this, we first propose recurrent attention layers that encode multiple segments into a compact memory latent vector; by maintaining this memory vector over time, MALT is able to condition on it and continuously generate new footage based on a long temporal context. We also present several training techniques that enable the model to generate frames over a long horizon with consistent quality and minimal degradation. We validate the effectiveness of MALT through experiments on long video benchmarks. We first perform extensive analysis of MALT in long-contextual understanding capability and stability using popular long video benchmarks. For example, MALT achieves an FVD score of 220.4 on 128-frame video generation on UCF-101, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of 648.4. Finally, we explore MALT's capabilities in a text-to-video generation setting and show that it can produce long videos compared with recent techniques for long text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop on AI for Content Creation (Oral)</p></details> |

However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in our project website: https://cumulo-autumn.github.io/StreamDiT/</p></details> |  |

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |

However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that generates both audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. By using a unified denoising network, UniForm captures the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Additionally, we propose task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling the model to support multiple tasks with a single set of parameters, including video-to-audio, audio-to-video and text-to-audio-video generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Experiments show that UniForm achieves performance close to the state-of-the-art single-task models across three generation tasks, with generated content that is not only highly aligned with real-world data distributions but also enables more diverse and fine-grained generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our demos are available at https://uniform-t2av.github.io/</p></details> |

However, existing methods often generate only a single dominant color, missing emotion variation. Others rely on indirect mappings through text or images, resulting in the loss of crucial emotion details. To address these challenges, we present Music2Palette, a novel method for emotion-aligned color palette generation via cross-modal representation learning. We first construct MuCED, a dataset of 2,634 expert-validated music-palette pairs aligned through Russell-based emotion vectors. To directly translate music into palettes, we propose a cross-modal representation learning framework with a music encoder and color decoder. We further propose a multi-objective optimization approach that jointly enhances emotion alignment, color diversity, and palette coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current methods in interpreting music emotion and generating attractive and diverse color palettes. Our approach enables applications like music-driven image recoloring, video generating, and data visualization, bridging the gap between auditory and visual emotion experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation Guided by Simple yet Effective Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04705v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Long Video Generation Consistency without Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17254v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the considerable progress achieved in the long video generation problem, there is still significant room to improve the consistency of the generated videos, particularly in terms of their smoothness and transitions between scenes. We address these issues to enhance the consistency and coherence of videos generated with either single or multiple prompts. We propose the Time-frequency based temporal Attention Reweighting Algorithm (TiARA), which judiciously edits the attention score matrix based on the Discrete Short-Time Fourier Transform. This method is supported by a frequency-based analysis, ensuring that the edited attention score matrix achieves improved consistency across frames. It represents the first-of-its-kind for frequency-based methods in video diffusion models. For videos generated by multiple prompts, we further uncover key factors such as the alignment of the prompts affecting prompt interpolation quality. Inspired by our analyses, we propose PromptBlend, an advanced prompt interpolation pipeline that systematically aligns the prompts. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating consistent and substantial improvements over multiple baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Building Physically Plausible World Models (Best Paper), 32 pages, 17 figures</p></details> |

However, generating temporally coherent and visually realistic videos remains a significant challenge due to the high dimensionality and complex dynamics of video data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep generative network architecture designed specifically for high-resolution video synthesis. Our approach integrates key concepts from Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs), enforcing a k-Lipschitz continuity constraint on the discriminator to stabilize training and enhance convergence. We further leverage Conditional GAN (cGAN) techniques by incorporating class labels during both training and inference, enabling class-specific video generation with improved semantic consistency. We provide a detailed layer-wise description of the Generator and Discriminator networks, highlighting architectural design choices promoting temporal coherence and spatial detail. The overall combined architecture, training algorithm, and optimization strategy are thoroughly presented. Our training objective combines a pixel-wise mean squared error loss with an adversarial loss to balance frame-level accuracy and video realism. We validate our approach on benchmark datasets including UCF101, Golf, and Aeroplane, encompassing diverse motion patterns and scene contexts. Quantitative evaluations using Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art unsupervised video generation methods in terms of both quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |

Processing these videos generates valuable assets for training sophisticated models. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-RL, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training model tailored for semantic segmentation for surgical scenes. CLIP-RL presents a new segmentation approach which involves reinforcement learning and curriculum learning, enabling continuous refinement of the segmentation masks during the full training pipeline. Our model has shown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions, texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges. CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic context that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL module plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through iterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018 and EndoVis 2017 datasets. CLIP-RL achieved a mean IoU of 81%, outperforming state-of-the-art models, and a mean IoU of 74.12% on EndoVis 2017. This superior performance was achieved due to the combination of contrastive learning with reinforcement learning and curriculum learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[PresentAgent: Multimodal Agent for Presentation Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04036v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PresentAgent, a multimodal agent that transforms long-form documents into narrated presentation videos. While existing approaches are limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames, generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible presentation formats.

However, the slow inference speed and high computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this, we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient, high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating videos in a wide range of scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nextframed.github.io/</p></details> |

As a result, there are also growing concerns about the potential misuse of video generation for spreading illegal content and misinformation. In this work, we introduce VGMShield: a set of straightforward but effective mitigations through the lifecycle of fake video generation. We start from fake video detection, trying to understand whether there is uniqueness in generated videos and whether we can differentiate them from real videos; then, we investigate the fake video source tracing problem, which maps a fake video back to the model that generated it. Towards these, we propose to leverage pre-trained models that focus on spatial-temporal dynamics as the backbone to identify inconsistencies in videos. In detail, we analyze fake videos from the perspective of the generation process. Based on the observation of attention shifts, motion variations, and frequency fluctuations, we identify common patterns in the generated video. These patterns serve as the foundation for our experiments on fake video detection and source tracing. Through experiments on seven state-of-the-art open-source models, we demonstrate that current models still cannot reliably reproduce spatial-temporal relationships, and thus, we can accomplish detection and source tracing with over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, anticipating future generative model improvements, we propose a prevention method that adds invisible perturbations to the query images to make the generated videos look unreal. Together with detection and tracing, our multi-faceted set of solutions can effectively mitigate misuse of video generative models.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Learning Video Generation for Robotic Manipulation with Collaborative Trajectory Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01943v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600, UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters, across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference. Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling, pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora, Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance, reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36% PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method.

However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content. Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video generation.

In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</p></details> |  |

We innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD), which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos. Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex, robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA models.

Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, potentially limiting their applications. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which improves the image quality by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. SG only relies on the sampling probabilities of its own diffusion model at different noise levels with no need of any guidance-specific training. This makes it flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms. We also introduce a more efficient approximation of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid doubling sampling time. We conduct experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG with only one forward pass. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability of eliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We will release our code along with this paper.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Models for Language Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07050v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution, followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation. Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed. Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of 4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting future work in non-autoregressive language generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>pdfLa...</summary><p>pdfLaTeX, 69 pages with 21 figures, Licentiate Thesis</p></details> |

Current research on video generation suggests a promising avenue for controllable film creation in pixel space using Diffusion models. However, the reliance on overly verbose prompts and insufficient focus on cinematic elements (e.g., camera movement) results in videos that lack cinematic quality. Furthermore, the absence of 3D modeling often leads to failures in video generation, such as inconsistent character models at different frames, ultimately hindering the immersive experience for viewers. In this paper, we propose a new framework for film creation, Dream-Cinema, which is designed for user-friendly, 3D space-based film creation with generative models. Specifically, we decompose 3D film creation into four key elements: 3D character, driven motion, camera movement, and environment. We extract the latter three elements from user-specified film shots and generate the 3D character using a generative model based on a provided image. To seamlessly recombine these elements and ensure smooth film creation, we propose structure-guided character animation, shape-aware camera movement optimization, and environment-aware generative refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating high-quality films with free camera and 3D characters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://liuff19.github.io/DreamCinema</p></details> |

Among them, Stable Diffusion (StableDiff) stands out as a key model for text-to-image generation and a foundation for next-generation multi-modal algorithms. However, its high computational and memory demands hinder inference speed and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we identify three core issues: (1) intensive and often redundant computations, (2) heterogeneous operations involving convolutions and attention mechanisms, and (3) diverse weight and activation sizes. We present SD-Acc, a novel algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework. At the algorithm level, we observe that high-level features in certain denoising phases show significant similarity, enabling approximate computation. Leveraging this, we propose an adaptive, phase-aware sampling strategy that reduces compute and memory loads. This framework automatically balances image quality and complexity based on the StableDiff model and user requirements. At the hardware level, we design an address-centric dataflow to efficiently handle heterogeneous operations within a simple systolic array. We address the bottleneck of nonlinear functions via a two-stage streaming architecture and a reconfigurable vector processing unit. Additionally, we implement adaptive dataflow optimizations by combining dynamic reuse and operator fusion tailored to StableDiff workloads, significantly reducing memory access. Across multiple StableDiff models, our method achieves up to a 3x reduction in computational demand without compromising image quality. Combined with our optimized hardware accelerator, SD-Acc delivers higher speed and energy efficiency than traditional CPU and GPU implementations.</p></details> | Under Review |

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Existing metrics are limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos. Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising 2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5% quality enhancement.

We introduce ConceptAttention, a novel method that leverages the expressive power of DiT attention layers to generate high-quality saliency maps that precisely locate textual concepts within images. Without requiring additional training, ConceptAttention repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce highly contextualized concept embeddings, contributing the major discovery that performing linear projections in the output space of DiT attention layers yields significantly sharper saliency maps compared to commonly used cross-attention maps. ConceptAttention even achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot image segmentation benchmarks, outperforming 15 other zero-shot interpretability methods on the ImageNet-Segmentation dataset. ConceptAttention works for popular image models and even seamlessly generalizes to video generation. Our work contributes the first evidence that the representations of multi-modal DiTs are highly transferable to vision tasks like segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral Presentation at ICML 2025, Best Paper Award at CVPR Workshop on Visual Concepts</p></details> |

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |

While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://robot4dgen.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Listener-Rewarded Thinking in VLMs for Image Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22832v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model ("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score, shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6% over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here: https://huggingface.co/alexgambashidze/qwen2.5vl_image_preference_reasoner.</p></details> |  |

We explore the affordance perception potential of text-to-video models by teaching them to predict human-environment interaction. Given a scene image and a prompt describing human actions, we fine-tune the model to insert a person into the scene, while ensuring coherent behavior, appearance, harmonization, and scene affordance. Unlike prior work, we infer human affordance for video generation (i.e., where to insert a person and how they should behave) from a single scene image, without explicit conditions like bounding boxes or body poses. An in-depth study of cross-attention heatmaps demonstrates that we can uncover the inherent affordance perception of a pre-trained video model without labeled affordance datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://shanmy.github.io/Populate-A-Scene</p></details> |
| **[FreeLong++: Training-Free Long Video Generation via Multi-band SpectralFusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00162v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation models have enabled high-quality short video generation from text prompts. However, extending these models to longer videos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal consistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively applying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable quality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where high-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows, an issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose FreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong achieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic semantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted from short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this, FreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture with multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale. By arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables multi-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both semantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video sequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into existing video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer videos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video generation tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length). It also supports coherent multi-prompt video generation with smooth scene transitions and enables controllable video generation using long depth or pose sequences.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Epona: Autoregressive Diffusion World Model for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24113v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling. However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning. This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end planners on NAVSIM benchmarks.

While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for high-res video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VMoBA</p></details> |
| **[SynMotion: Semantic-Visual Adaptation for Motion Customized Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23690v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or ''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines.

However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals).

Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data, which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos, achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://becauseimbatman0.github.io/ViewPoint</p></details> |

We propose a diffusion factor model that integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes, bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4} n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable for markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior performance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical analysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in constructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work presents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion models, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial simulation with limited data. Our code is available at https://github.com/xymmmm00/diffusion_factor_model.</p></details> |  |

However, enabling precise control of continuous attributes, especially multiple attributes simultaneously, in a new domain (e.g., numeric values like eye openness or car width) with text-only guidance remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Attribute (Att) Adapter, a novel plug-and-play module designed to enable fine-grained, multi-attributes control in pretrained diffusion models. Our approach learns a single control adapter from a set of sample images that can be unpaired and contain multiple visual attributes. The Att-Adapter leverages the decoupled cross attention module to naturally harmonize the multiple domain attributes with text conditioning. We further introduce Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to the Att-Adapter to mitigate overfitting, matching the diverse nature of the visual world. Evaluations on two public datasets show that Att-Adapter outperforms all LoRA-based baselines in controlling continuous attributes. Additionally, our method enables a broader control range and also improves disentanglement across multiple attributes, surpassing StyleGAN-based techniques. Notably, Att-Adapter is flexible, requiring no paired synthetic data for training, and is easily scalable to multiple attributes within a single model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV'...</summary><p>ICCV'25, The project page is available at https://tri-mac.github.io/att-adapter/</p></details> |

Existing deep learning methods have made progress but still face limitations in handling complex scenes and preserving image details. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based latent diffusion model (LDM) fine-tuning method for remote sensing image super-resolution. The method constructs a reinforcement learning environment with states, actions, and rewards, optimizing decision objectives through proximal policy optimization (PPO) during the reverse denoising process of the LDM model. Experiments on the RESISC45 dataset show significant improvements over the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, with PSNR increasing by 3-4dB, SSIM improving by 0.08-0.11, and LPIPS reducing by 0.06-0.10, particularly in structured and complex natural scenes. The results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing super-resolution quality and adaptability across scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission included authors who did not consent to the submission.

| **[Context Diffusion: In-Context Aware Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03584v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Context Diffusion, a diffusion-based framework that enables image generation models to learn from visual examples presented in context. Recent work tackles such in-context learning for image generation, where a query image is provided alongside context examples and text prompts. However, the quality and context fidelity of the generated images deteriorate when the prompt is not present, demonstrating that these models cannot truly learn from the visual context. To address this, we propose a novel framework that separates the encoding of the visual context and the preservation of the desired image layout. This results in the ability to learn from the visual context and prompts, but also from either of them. Furthermore, we enable our model to handle few-shot settings, to effectively address diverse in-context learning scenarios. Our experiments and human evaluation demonstrate that Context Diffusion excels in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, resulting in an overall enhancement in image quality and context fidelity compared to counterpart models.</p></details> |  |

Since stereo image datasets with large baselines are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore, we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of RIS-assisted systems critically depends on accurate channel state information (CSI). To address this challenge, this letter proposes a novel channel estimation method for RIS-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems based on diffusion models (DMs). Specifically, the forward diffusion process of the original signal is formulated to model the received signal as a noisy observation within the framework of DMs. Subsequently, the channel estimation task is formulated as the reverse diffusion process, and a sampling algorithm based on denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) is developed to enable effective inference. Furthermore, a lightweight neural network, termed BRCNet, is introduced to replace the conventional U-Net, significantly reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity. Extensive experiments conducted under various scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Accelerating Parallel Diffusion Model Serving with Residual Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17511v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices, limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations, saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information. To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On 4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method. CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings, and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework. Portable implementation demonstrated on xDiT is publicly available at https://github.com/Cobalt-27/CompactFusion</p></details> |  |

A critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language: poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings. Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced information capture in the generated images.</p></details> | ECAI 2025 |

JEDI is model-agnostic and applicable to architectures such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 and 3.5, consistently improving prompt alignment and disentanglement in complex scenes. Additionally, JEDI provides a lightweight, CLIP-free disentanglement score derived from internal attention distributions, offering a principled benchmark for compositional alignment under test-time conditions.

Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation (DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation, while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions.

Quantization offers an effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However, existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations, which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream deployment tools.</p></details> |  |

This gap drives the need for synthesizing photorealistic polarization images.The existing polarization simulator Mitsuba relies on a parametric polarization image formation model and requires extensive 3D assets covering shape and PBR materials, preventing it from generating large-scale photorealistic images. To address this problem, we propose PolarAnything, capable of synthesizing polarization images from a single RGB input with both photorealism and physical accuracy, eliminating the dependency on 3D asset collections. Drawing inspiration from the zero-shot performance of pretrained diffusion models, we introduce a diffusion-based generative framework with an effective representation strategy that preserves the fidelity of polarization properties. Experiments show that our model generates high-quality polarization images and supports downstream tasks like shape from polarization.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[MoDA: Multi-modal Diffusion Architecture for Talking Head Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03256v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a crucial problem in the realm of the virtual metaverse. Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this field with their strong generation capabilities. However, several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference and visual artifacts caused by the implicit latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which complicates the diffusion process; 2) a lack of authentic facial expressions and head movements due to inadequate multi-modal information fusion. In this paper, MoDA handles these challenges by: 1) defining a joint parameter space that bridges motion generation and neural rendering, and leveraging flow matching to simplify diffusion learning; 2) introducing a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, enhancing overall facial expressiveness. In addition, a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy is employed to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring effective feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MoDA improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.

In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical features maintained by Masked AutoEncoders. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders (LDMAEs).</p></details> |  |

However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention (TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment. When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead. We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance, attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models.

However, the "black-box" nature of such deep learning methods adds a layer of opaqueness that hinders the proper understanding of detection decisions, trust in the decisions and prevent timely countermeasures against such attacks. Explainable AI (XAI) methods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the causes of the predictions. The majority of the existing XAI methods provide explanations which are not convenient to convert into actionable countermeasures. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based counterfactual explanation framework that can provide actionable explanations for network intrusion attacks. We evaluated our proposed algorithm against several other publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3 modern network intrusion datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work also presents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation algorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our proposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the tested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by reducing the time to generate explanations. We also demonstrate how counterfactual explanations can provide actionable explanations by summarizing them to create a set of global rules. These rules are actionable not only at instance level but also at the global level for intrusion attacks. These global counterfactual rules show the ability to effectively filter out incoming attack queries which is crucial for efficient intrusion detection and defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Parasite-1715/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gungnir: Exploiting Stylistic Features in Images for Backdoor Attacks on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20650v4)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated significant advances in the field of image generation. However, according to current research, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to control the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such as a specific visual patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well equipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger inversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input spaces and low-dimensional triggers. For example, visual triggers are easily observed by defenders, text-based or attention-based triggers are more susceptible to neural network detection. To explore more possibilities of backdoor attack in DMs, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables attackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through style triggers within input images. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the first time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image-to-image tasks by introducing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term Timesteps-Retention (STTR). Our technique generates trigger-embedded images that are perceptually indistinguishable from clean images, thus bypassing both manual inspection and automated detection neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that Gungnir can easily bypass existing defense methods. Among existing DM defense frameworks, our approach achieves a 0 backdoor detection rate (BDR). Our codes are available at https://github.com/paoche11/Gungnir.</p></details> |  |

Existing training-free acceleration strategies that reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling time, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We hypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts correspond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not consider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this paper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a novel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a single stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative models (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates sparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled approximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the numerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using both EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\ge 1.8\times$ speedups with minimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\leq 0.10$ and FID $\leq 4.5$) compared to unmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, SADA adapts seamlessly to other pipelines and modalities: It accelerates ControlNet without any modifications and speeds up MusicLDM by $1.8\times$ with $\sim 0.01$ spectrogram LPIPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published by ICML 2025.

We address this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture. First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date, consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1) Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications, from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle some of these tasks. We present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that uses only a single discrete diffusion model to handle diverse drug discovery scenarios. GenMol generates Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing the utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering while having better sampling efficiency. GenMol uses fragments as basic building blocks for molecules and introduces fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by regenerating masked fragments, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. We further propose molecular context guidance (MCG), a guidance method tailored for masked discrete diffusion of GenMol. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design.

The Diffuse Domain Method (DDM) is an alternative that reformulates the partial differential equations on a larger, simpler domain. The original geometry is embedded into the problem by representing it with a phase-field function. This paper introduces ddfem, an extensible Python package to provide a framework for transforming PDEs into a Diffuse Domain formulation. We aim to make the application of a variety of different Diffuse Domain approaches more accessible and straightforward to use. The ddfem package includes features to intuitively define complex domains by combining signed distance functions and provides a number of DDM transformers for general second evolution equations. In addition, we present a new approach for combining multiple boundary conditions of different types on distinct boundary segments. This is achieved by applying a normalised weighting, derived from multiple phase fields, to combine the additional boundary terms in the Diffuse Domain formulations. The domain definition and Diffuse Domain transformation provided by our package are designed to be compatible with a wide range of existing finite element solvers without requiring code alterations. Both the original (non-linear) PDEs provided by the user and the resulting transformed PDEs on the extended domain are defined using the Unified Form Language UFL which is a domain specific language used by a number of software packages. Our experiments were carried out using the Dune-Fem framework.</p></details> |  |

Addressing these challenges requires architectures that are robust to the unique complexities posed by medical imaging data. Rapid advancements in vision-language foundation models within the natural image domain prompt the question of how they can be adapted for medical imaging tasks. In this work, we present PRISM, a framework that leverages foundation models to generate high-resolution, language-guided medical image counterfactuals using Stable Diffusion. Our approach demonstrates unprecedented precision in selectively modifying spurious correlations (the medical devices) and disease features, enabling the removal and addition of specific attributes while preserving other image characteristics. Through extensive evaluation, we show how PRISM advances counterfactual generation and enables the development of more robust downstream classifiers for clinically deployable solutions. To facilitate broader adoption and research, we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/Amarkr1/PRISM.</p></details> | MIDL 2025 |

Motivated by these limitations, we introduce HarmonPaint, a training-free inpainting framework that seamlessly integrates with the attention mechanisms of diffusion models to achieve high-quality, harmonized image inpainting without any form of training. By leveraging masking strategies within self-attention, HarmonPaint ensures structural fidelity without model retraining or fine-tuning. Additionally, we exploit intrinsic diffusion model properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions, achieving a harmonious integration of styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HarmonPaint across diverse scenes and styles, validating its versatility and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding Dori: Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Is Less Local Than Assumed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16880v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[VitaGlyph: Vitalizing Artistic Typography with Flexible Dual-branch Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01738v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artistic typography is a technique to visualize the meaning of input character in an imaginable and readable manner. With powerful text-to-image diffusion models, existing methods directly design the overall geometry and texture of input character, making it challenging to ensure both creativity and legibility. In this paper, we introduce a dual-branch, training-free method called VitaGlyph, enabling flexible artistic typography with controllable geometry changes while maintaining the readability. The key insight of VitaGlyph is to treat input character as a scene composed of a Subject and its Surrounding, which are rendered with varying degrees of geometric transformation. To enhance the visual appeal and creativity of the generated artistic typography, the subject flexibly expresses the essential concept of the input character, while the surrounding enriches relevant background without altering the shape, thus maintaining overall readability. Specifically, we implement VitaGlyph through a three-phase framework: (i) Knowledge Acquisition leverages large language models to design text descriptions for the subject and surrounding. (ii) Regional Interpretation detects the part that most closely matches the subject description and refines the structure via Semantic Typography. (iii) Attentional Compositional Generation separately renders the textures of the Subject and Surrounding regions and blends them in an attention-based manner. Experimental results demonstrate that VitaGlyph not only achieves better artistry and readability but also manages to depict multiple customized concepts, facilitating more creative and pleasing artistic typography generation. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Carlofkl/VitaGlyph</p></details> |

The paper presents a novel image synthesis network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers. Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows significant advantages over other methods.

Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors. This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV), which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under the semi-supervised learning setting. This work presents a robust and data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong potential for a wide range of clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-aware Diffusion-Enhanced architecture using contrastive learning paradigms (KDiffE) for multimedia recommendations. Specifically, we first utilize original user-item graphs to build an attention-aware matrix into graph neural networks, which can learn the importance between users and items for main view construction. The attention-aware matrix is constructed by adopting a random walk with a restart strategy, which can preserve the importance between users and items to generate aggregation of attention-aware node features. Then, we propose a guided diffusion model to generate strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs with less noise for constructing a knowledge-aware contrastive view, which utilizes user embeddings with an edge connected to an item to guide the generation of strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs for enhancing the item's semantic information. We perform comprehensive experiments on three multimedia datasets that reveal the effectiveness of our KDiffE and its components on various state-of-the-art methods.

The semantics, context, and structure of an image can evoke emotional responses, making emotional image editing techniques valuable for various real-world applications, including treatment of psychological disorders, commercialization of products, and artistic design. First, we present a novel challenge of emotion-evoked image generation, aiming to synthesize images that evoke target emotions while retaining the semantics and structures of the original scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion model capable of effectively understanding and editing source images to convey desired emotions and sentiments. Moreover, due to the lack of emotion editing datasets, we provide a unique dataset consisting of 340,000 pairs of images and their emotion annotations. Furthermore, we conduct human psychophysics experiments and introduce a new evaluation metric to systematically benchmark all the methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses all competitive baselines. Our diffusion model is capable of identifying emotional cues from original images, editing images that elicit desired emotions, and meanwhile, preserving the semantic structure of the original images.

However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

Although existing methods based on either implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model (FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM) that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging scenarios with extreme pose variations.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity, they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation, ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets, fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

Anomaly detection methods also fall into this scope and utilize diffusion models to generate or reconstruct normal samples when given arbitrary anomaly images. However, our study found that the diffusion model suffers from severe ``faithfulness hallucination'' and ``catastrophic forgetting'', which can't meet the unpredictable pattern increments. To mitigate the above problems, we propose a continual diffusion model that uses gradient projection to achieve stable continual learning. Gradient projection deploys a regularization on the model updating by modifying the gradient towards the direction protecting the learned knowledge. But as a double-edged sword, it also requires huge memory costs brought by the Markov process. Hence, we propose an iterative singular value decomposition method based on the transitive property of linear representation, which consumes tiny memory and incurs almost no performance loss. Finally, considering the risk of ``over-fitting'' to normal images of the diffusion model, we propose an anomaly-masked network to enhance the condition mechanism of the diffusion model. For continual anomaly detection, ours achieves first place in 17/18 settings on MVTec and VisA. Code is available at https://github.com/FuNz-0/One-for-More</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

Existing methods for addressing ECG noise, relying on artifact classification or denoising, are constrained by annotation inconsistencies and poor generalizability. Here, we address these limitations by reframing ECG noise quantification as an anomaly detection task. We propose a diffusion-based framework trained to model the normative distribution of clean ECG signals, identifying deviations as noise without requiring explicit artifact labels. To robustly evaluate performance and mitigate label inconsistencies, we introduce a distribution-based metric using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$). Our model achieved a macro-average $W_1$ score of 1.308, outperforming the next-best method by over 48\%. External validation confirmed strong generalizability, facilitating the exclusion of noisy segments to improve diagnostic accuracy and support timely clinical intervention. This approach enhances real-time ECG monitoring and broadens ECG applicability in digital health technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript contains 17 pages, 10 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |

With the growing integration of renewables and increasing system complexity, microgrid communities face significant challenges in real-time energy scheduling and optimization under uncertainty. DiffCarl integrates a diffusion model into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable adaptive energy scheduling under uncertainty and explicitly account for carbon emissions and operational risk. By learning action distributions through a denoising generation process, DiffCarl enhances DRL policy expressiveness and enables carbon- and risk-aware scheduling in dynamic and uncertain microgrid environments. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that it outperforms classic algorithms and state-of-the-art DRL solutions, with 2.3-30.1% lower operational cost. It also achieves 28.7% lower carbon emissions than those of its carbon-unaware variant and reduces performance variability. These results highlight DiffCarl as a practical and forward-looking solution. Its flexible design allows efficient adaptation to different system configurations and objectives to support real-world deployment in evolving energy systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[LSSGen: Leveraging Latent Space Scaling in Flow and Diffusion for Efficient Text to Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16154v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches. When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\% TOPIQ score improvement.</p></details> | ICCV AIGENS 2025 |

The initial data are assumed to reside in the fractional Sobolev space H^gamma with 0 < gamma < 2, where classical regularity conditions are violated, necessitating specialized error analysis. By integrating semigroup techniques and fractional Sobolev space theory, sharp fully discrete error estimates are derived in both L2 and H1 norms. This demonstrates that the convergence order adapts to the smoothness of initial data, a key advancement over traditional approaches that assume higher regularity. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DP-TLDM: Differentially Private Tabular Latent Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07842v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data from generative models emerges as the privacy-preserving data sharing solution. Such a synthetic data set shall resemble the original data without revealing identifiable private information. Till date, the prior focus on limited types of tabular synthesizers and a small number of privacy attacks, particularly on Generative Adversarial Networks, and overlooks membership inference attacks and defense strategies, i.e., differential privacy. Motivated by the conundrum of keeping high data quality and low privacy risk of synthetic data tables, we propose DPTLDM, Differentially Private Tabular Latent Diffusion Model, which is composed of an autoencoder network to encode the tabular data and a latent diffusion model to synthesize the latent tables. Following the emerging f-DP framework, we apply DP-SGD to train the auto-encoder in combination with batch clipping and use the separation value as the privacy metric to better capture the privacy gain from DP algorithms. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that DPTLDM is capable of achieving a meaningful theoretical privacy guarantee while also significantly enhancing the utility of synthetic data. Specifically, compared to other DP-protected tabular generative models, DPTLDM improves the synthetic quality by an average of 35% in data resemblance, 15% in the utility for downstream tasks, and 50% in data discriminability, all while preserving a comparable level of privacy risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Researcher with Test-Time Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16075v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex, long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Diversity and Control in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10637v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilled diffusion models suffer from a critical limitation: reduced sample diversity compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of sample-diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we utilize $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{0}$ visualization as an analysis and debugging tool to reveal how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{0}$ visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications.

Fine-grained video editing is crucial for enabling precise, object-level modifications while maintaining context and temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce FiVE, a Fine-grained Video Editing Benchmark for evaluating emerging diffusion and rectified flow models. Our benchmark includes 74 real-world videos and 26 generated videos, featuring 6 fine-grained editing types, 420 object-level editing prompt pairs, and their corresponding masks. Additionally, we adapt the latest rectified flow (RF) T2V generation models, Pyramid-Flow and Wan2.1, by introducing FlowEdit, resulting in training-free and inversion-free video editing models Pyramid-Edit and Wan-Edit. We evaluate five diffusion-based and two RF-based editing methods on our FiVE benchmark using 15 metrics, covering background preservation, text-video similarity, temporal consistency, video quality, and runtime. To further enhance object-level evaluation, we introduce FiVE-Acc, a novel metric leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to assess the success of fine-grained video editing. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-based editing significantly outperforms diffusion-based methods, with Wan-Edit achieving the best overall performance and exhibiting the least sensitivity to hyperparameters.

Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present DiffuMeta, a generative framework integrating diffusion transformers with a novel algebraic language representation, encoding 3D geometries as mathematical sentences. This compact, unified parameterization spans diverse topologies while enabling direct application of transformers to structural design. DiffuMeta leverages diffusion models to generate novel shell structures with precisely targeted stress-strain responses under large deformations, accounting for buckling and contact while addressing the inherent one-to-many mapping by producing diverse solutions. Uniquely, our approach enables simultaneous control over multiple mechanical objectives, including linear and nonlinear responses beyond training domains. Experimental validation of fabricated structures further confirms the efficacy of our approach for accelerated design of metamaterials and structures with tailored properties.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional differentiable particle filters, which require importance weighting and typically rely on predefined or low-capacity proposal distributions. DiffPF learns a flexible posterior sampler by conditioning a diffusion model on predicted particles and the current observation. This enables accurate, equally-weighted sampling from complex, high-dimensional, and multimodal filtering distributions. We evaluate DiffPF across a range of scenarios, including both unimodal and highly multimodal distributions, and test it on simulated as well as real-world tasks, where it consistently outperforms existing filtering baselines. In particular, DiffPF achieves an 82.8% improvement in estimation accuracy on a highly multimodal global localization benchmark, and a 26% improvement on the real-world KITTI visual odometry benchmark, compared to state-of-the-art differentiable filters. To the best of our knowledge, DiffPF is the first method to integrate conditional diffusion models into particle filtering, enabling high-quality posterior sampling that produces more informative particles and significantly improves state estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[BackdoorDM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Backdoor Learning on Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11798v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor learning is a critical research topic for understanding the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks. While the diffusion model (DM) has been broadly deployed in public over the past few years, the understanding of its backdoor vulnerability is still in its infancy compared to the extensive studies in discriminative models. Recently, many different backdoor attack and defense methods have been proposed for DMs, but a comprehensive benchmark for backdoor learning on DMs is still lacking. This absence makes it difficult to conduct fair comparisons and thorough evaluations of the existing approaches, thus hindering future research progress. To address this issue, we propose \textit{BackdoorDM}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for backdoor learning on DMs. It comprises nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods, four SOTA defense strategies, and three useful visualization analysis tools. We first systematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a unified framework, focusing on three different backdoor attack types and five backdoor target types, which are restricted to a single type in discriminative models. Then, we systematically summarize the evaluation metrics for each type and propose a unified backdoor evaluation method based on multimodal large language model (MLLM). Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and highlight several important conclusions. We believe that BackdoorDM will help overcome current barriers and contribute to building a trustworthy artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) community.

Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source text-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12 billion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises concerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability. Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the environment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to enhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models. Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters and prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated images while also lowering the energy consumption required for image generation. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to that of the original SD model. Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion, testing it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our results demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%, ethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and GPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are consistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts. Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social and environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible without fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.</p></details> |  |

One key area is the segmentation of skin lesions, which is vital for diagnosing skin cancer and monitoring patients. In this context, this paper introduces SegDT, a new segmentation model based on diffusion transformer (DiT). SegDT is designed to work on low-cost hardware and incorporates Rectified Flow, which improves the generation quality at reduced inference steps and maintains the flexibility of standard diffusion models. Our method is evaluated on three benchmarking datasets and compared against several existing works, achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining fast inference speeds.

Nonetheless, they have several shortcomings in that they (1) require white-box access to models, (2) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and (3) produce attributions that lie off the image manifold, leading to explanations that are not actually faithful to the model and do not align well with human perception. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Derivative-Free Diffusion Manifold-Constrainted Gradients (FreeMCG), a novel method that serves as an improved basis for explainability of a given neural network than the traditional gradient. Specifically, by leveraging ensemble Kalman filters and diffusion models, we derive a derivative-free approximation of the model's gradient projected onto the data manifold, requiring access only to the model's outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FreeMCG by applying it to both counterfactual generation and feature attribution, which have traditionally been treated as distinct tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on both tasks, counterfactual explanation and feature attribution, we show that our method yields state-of-the-art results while preserving the essential properties expected of XAI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (poster), 19 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Moreover, spatial masks or denoising schedules with varying $\omega$ values can be applied to achieve region-specific or timestep-specific granularity control. External control signals or reference images can guide the creation of precise $\omega$ masks, allowing targeted granularity adjustments.

However, existing diffusion-based approaches for local image editing often suffer from undesired artifacts due to the latent-level blending of the noised target images and diffusion latent variables, which lack the necessary semantics for maintaining image consistency. To address these issues, we propose PFB-Diff, a Progressive Feature Blending method for Diffusion-based image editing. Unlike previous methods, PFB-Diff seamlessly integrates text-guided generated content into the target image through multi-level feature blending. The rich semantics encoded in deep features and the progressive blending scheme from high to low levels ensure semantic coherence and high quality in edited images. Additionally, we introduce an attention masking mechanism in the cross-attention layers to confine the impact of specific words to desired regions, further improving the performance of background editing and multi-object replacement. PFB-Diff can effectively address various editing tasks, including object/background replacement and object attribute editing. Our method demonstrates its superior performance in terms of editing accuracy and image quality without the need for fine-tuning or training.

However, prior works face challenges in preserving global coherence while locally modifying the input 3D shape. In this work, we introduce an inpainting-based framework for editing shapes represented as point clouds. Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for achieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a partial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the shape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within the local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending algorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a progression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate blending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited version, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing the need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques across a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original shape and also adherence to the textual description.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

A key advancement in this area is the deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) technique that designs a direct mapping of input signals to channel symbols parameterized by a neural network, which can be trained for arbitrary channel models and semantic quality metrics. This paper advances the DeepJSCC framework toward a semantics-aligned, high-fidelity transmission approach, called semantics-guided diffusion DeepJSCC (SGD-JSCC). Existing schemes that integrate diffusion models (DMs) with JSCC face challenges in transforming random generation into accurate reconstruction and adapting to varying channel conditions. SGD-JSCC incorporates two key innovations: (1) utilizing some inherent information that contributes to the semantics of an image, such as text description or edge map, to guide the diffusion denoising process; and (2) enabling seamless adaptability to varying channel conditions with the help of a semantics-guided DM for channel denoising. The DM is guided by diverse semantic information and integrates seamlessly with DeepJSCC. In a slow fading channel, SGD-JSCC dynamically adapts to the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) directly estimated from the channel output, thereby eliminating the need for additional pilot transmissions for channel estimation. In a fast fading channel, we introduce a training-free denoising strategy, allowing SGD-JSCC to effectively adjust to fluctuations in channel gains. Numerical results demonstrate that, guided by semantic information and leveraging the powerful DM, our method outperforms existing DeepJSCC schemes, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing acceleration techniques either require extensive model retraining or compromise significantly on sample quality. This paper explores a general, training-free, and model-agnostic acceleration strategy via multi-core parallelism. Our framework views multi-core diffusion sampling as an ODE solver pipeline, where slower yet accurate solvers progressively rectify faster solvers through a theoretically justified inter-core communication mechanism. This motivates our multi-core training-free diffusion sampling accelerator, CHORDS, which is compatible with various diffusion samplers, model architectures, and modalities. Through extensive experiments, CHORDS significantly accelerates sampling across diverse large-scale image and video diffusion models, yielding up to 2.1x speedup with four cores, improving by 50% over baselines, and 2.9x speedup with eight cores, all without quality degradation.

Existing alternatives typically require either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets. Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers (e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences.

| **[Solving dynamic portfolio selection problems via score-based diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09916v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle the dynamic mean-variance portfolio selection problem in a {\it model-free} manner, based on (generative) diffusion models. We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathbb P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathbb Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&P 500.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on https://github.com/fy-yuan/diffusion_dynamic_mv. v2 addresses certain typos and small issues</p></details> |
| **[Improving Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture with Diffusion Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15216v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for feature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven especially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending generative models. However, generative models perform better in image generation and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to further enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study to confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes will be released soon in public.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning under Latent Group Sparsity via Diffusion on Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15097v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group or cluster structure on explanatory variables in machine learning problems is a very general phenomenon, which has attracted broad interest from practitioners and theoreticians alike. In this work we contribute an approach to sparse learning under such group structure, that does not require prior information on the group identities. Our paradigm is motivated by the Laplacian geometry of an underlying network with a related community structure, and proceeds by directly incorporating this into a penalty that is effectively computed via a heat-flow-based local network dynamics. The proposed penalty interpolates between the lasso and the group lasso penalties, the runtime of the heat-flow dynamics being the interpolating parameter. As such it can automatically default to lasso when the group structure reflected in the Laplacian is weak. In fact, we demonstrate a data-driven procedure to construct such a network based on the available data. Notably, we dispense with computationally intensive pre-processing involving clustering of variables, spectral or otherwise. Our technique is underpinned by rigorous theorems that guarantee its effective performance and provide bounds on its sample complexity. In particular, in a wide range of settings, it provably suffices to run the diffusion for time that is only logarithmic in the problem dimensions. We explore in detail the interfaces of our approach with key statistical physics models in network science, such as the Gaussian Free Field and the Stochastic Block Model. Our work raises the possibility of applying similar diffusion-based techniques to classical learning tasks, exploiting the interplay between geometric, dynamical and stochastic structures underlying the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables; this submission subsumes the earlier preprint arXiv:2201.08326</p></details> |
| **[PET Image Reconstruction Using Deep Diffusion Image Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15078v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown great promise in medical image denoising and reconstruction, but their application to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging remains limited by tracer-specific contrast variability and high computational demands. In this work, we proposed an anatomical prior-guided PET image reconstruction method based on diffusion models, inspired by the deep diffusion image prior (DDIP) framework. The proposed method alternated between diffusion sampling and model fine-tuning guided by the PET sinogram, enabling the reconstruction of high-quality images from various PET tracers using a score function pretrained on a dataset of another tracer. To improve computational efficiency, the half-quadratic splitting (HQS) algorithm was adopted to decouple network optimization from iterative PET reconstruction. The proposed method was evaluated using one simulation and two clinical datasets. For the simulation study, a model pretrained on [$^{18}$F]FDG data was tested on amyloid-negative PET data to assess out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. For the clinical-data validation, ten low-dose [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets and one [$^{18}$F]Florbetapir dataset were tested on a model pretrained on data from another tracer. Experiment results show that the proposed PET reconstruction method can generalize robustly across tracer distributions and scanner types, providing an efficient and versatile reconstruction framework for low-dose PET imaging.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Trustworthy Text-to-Image Diffusion Models: A Timely and Focused Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18214v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) Diffusion Models (DMs) have garnered widespread attention for their impressive advancements in image generation. However, their growing popularity has raised ethical and social concerns related to key non-functional properties of trustworthiness, such as robustness, fairness, security, privacy, factuality, and explainability, similar to those in traditional deep learning (DL) tasks. Conventional approaches for studying trustworthiness in DL tasks often fall short due to the unique characteristics of T2I DMs, e.g., the multi-modal nature. Given the challenge, recent efforts have been made to develop new methods for investigating trustworthiness in T2I DMs via various means, including falsification, enhancement, verification \& validation and assessment. However, there is a notable lack of in-depth analysis concerning those non-functional properties and means. In this survey, we provide a timely and focused review of the literature on trustworthy T2I DMs, covering a concise-structured taxonomy from the perspectives of property, means, benchmarks and applications. Our review begins with an introduction to essential preliminaries of T2I DMs, and then we summarise key definitions/metrics specific to T2I tasks and analyses the means proposed in recent literature based on these definitions/metrics. Additionally, we review benchmarks and domain applications of T2I DMs. Finally, we highlight the gaps in current research, discuss the limitations of existing methods, and propose future research directions to advance the development of trustworthy T2I DMs. Furthermore, we keep up-to-date updates in this field to track the latest developments and maintain our GitHub repository at: https://github.com/wellzline/Trustworthy_T2I_DMs</p></details> | under review |
| **[Paired Image Generation with Diffusion-Guided Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14833v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions, which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges. First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second, existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method. The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions. Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Parallel Gradients for Fast ODE Solvers of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14797v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature. Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face image quality degradation under a low-latency budget. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as \ours), a novel ODE solver that mitigates truncation errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each ODE step. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling. Our method optimizes a small set of learnable parameters in a distillation fashion, ensuring minimal training overhead. In addition, our method can serve as a plugin to improve existing ODE samplers. Extensive experiments on various image synthesis benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our \ours~in achieving high-quality and low-latency sampling. For example, at the same latency level of 5 NFE, EPD achieves an FID of 4.47 on CIFAR-10, 7.97 on FFHQ, 8.17 on ImageNet, and 8.26 on LSUN Bedroom, surpassing existing learning-based solvers by a significant margin.

| **[Fine-Tuning Diffusion Generative Models via Rich Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11720v4)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Rich Preference Optimization (RPO), a novel pipeline that leverages rich feedback signals to improve the curation of preference pairs for fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models. Traditional methods, like Diffusion-DPO, often rely solely on reward model labeling, which can be opaque, offer limited insights into the rationale behind preferences, and are prone to issues such as reward hacking or overfitting. In contrast, our approach begins with generating detailed critiques of synthesized images, from which we extract reliable and actionable image editing instructions. By implementing these instructions, we create refined images, resulting in synthetic, informative preference pairs that serve as enhanced tuning datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and the resulting datasets in fine-tuning state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Diffusion-RLHF/RPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[OSCAR: One-Step Diffusion Codec Across Multiple Bit-rates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16091v4)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents, where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/jp-guo/OSCAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-observation augmented diffusion model for nonlinear assimilation with unknown dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21314v3)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data assimilation has become a key technique for combining physical models with observational data to estimate state variables. However, classical assimilation algorithms often struggle with the high nonlinearity present in both physical and observational models. To address this challenge, a novel generative model, termed the State-Observation Augmented Diffusion (SOAD) model is proposed for data-driven assimilation. The marginal posterior associated with SOAD has been derived and then proved to match the true posterior distribution under mild assumptions, suggesting its theoretical advantages over previous score-based approaches. Experimental results also indicate that SOAD may offer improved performance compared to existing data-driven methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLADIS: Pushing the Limits of Attention in Diffusion Models at Inference Time by Leveraging Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07677v3)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating high-quality conditional samples using guidance techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, existing methods often require additional training or neural function evaluations (NFEs), making them incompatible with guidance-distilled models. Also, they rely on heuristic approaches that need identifying target layers. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method, termed PLADIS, which boosts pre-trained models (U-Net/Transformer) by leveraging sparse attention. Specifically, we extrapolate query-key correlations using softmax and its sparse counterpart in the cross-attention layer during inference, without requiring extra training or NFEs. By leveraging the noise robustness of sparse attention, our PLADIS unleashes the latent potential of text-to-image diffusion models, enabling them to excel in areas where they once struggled with newfound effectiveness. It integrates seamlessly with guidance techniques, including guidance-distilled models. Extensive experiments show notable improvements in text alignment and human preference, offering a highly efficient and universally applicable solution.

| **[Benchmarking GANs, Diffusion Models, and Flow Matching for T1w-to-T2w MRI Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14575v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables the acquisition of multiple image contrasts, such as T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) scans, each offering distinct diagnostic insights. However, acquiring all desired modalities increases scan time and cost, motivating research into computational methods for cross-modal synthesis. To address this, recent approaches aim to synthesize missing MRI contrasts from those already acquired, reducing acquisition time while preserving diagnostic quality. Image-to-image (I2I) translation provides a promising framework for this task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of generative models$\unicode{x2013}$specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and flow matching (FM) techniques$\unicode{x2013}$for T1w-to-T2w 2D MRI I2I translation. All frameworks are implemented with comparable settings and evaluated on three publicly available MRI datasets of healthy adults. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses show that the GAN-based Pix2Pix model outperforms diffusion and FM-based methods in terms of structural fidelity, image quality, and computational efficiency. Consistent with existing literature, these results suggest that flow-based models are prone to overfitting on small datasets and simpler tasks, and may require more data to match or surpass GAN performance. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying I2I translation techniques in real-world MRI workflows and highlight promising directions for future research in cross-modal medical image synthesis.

| **[Inference for Diffusion Processes via Controlled Sequential Monte Carlo and Splitting Schemes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14535v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an inferential framework for a wide class of semi-linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Recent work has shown that numerical splitting schemes can preserve critical properties of such types of SDEs, give rise to explicit pseudolikelihoods, and hence allow for parameter inference for fully observed processes. Here, under several discrete time observation regimes (particularly, partially and fully observed with and without noise), we represent the implied pseudolikelihood as the normalising constant of a Feynman--Kac flow, allowing its efficient estimation via controlled sequential Monte Carlo and adapt likelihood-based methods to exploit this pseudolikelihood for inference. The strategy developed herein allows us to obtain good inferential results across a range of problems. Using diffusion bridges, we are able to computationally reduce bias coming from time-discretisation without recourse to more complex numerical schemes which typically require considerable application-specific efforts. Simulations illustrate that our method provides an excellent trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy, under hypoellipticity, for both point and posterior estimation. Application to a neuroscience example shows the good performance of the method in challenging settings.</p></details> |  |
