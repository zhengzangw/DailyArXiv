| **[Self Forcing: Bridging the Train-Test Gap in Autoregressive Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08009v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

| **[Dreamland: Controllable World Creation with Simulator and Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08006v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://metadriverse.github.io/dreamland/</p></details> |
| **[Audio-Sync Video Generation with Multi-Stream Temporal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08003v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world, making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives (e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation. MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks, enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood, respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment.

| **[Generative Modeling of Weights: Generalization or Memorization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07998v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work, we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model, and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new domains. Our code is available at https://github.com/boyazeng/weight_memorization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://boyazeng.github.io/weight_memorization</p></details> |
| **[Video Unlearning via Low-Rank Refusal Vector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07891v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generative models democratize the creation of visual content through intuitive instruction following, but they also inherit the biases and harmful concepts embedded within their web-scale training data. This inheritance creates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even illegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored explicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our method requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a "safe" and an "unsafe" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their per-layer latent differences produces a "refusal vector", which, once subtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We introduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference of embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target concept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus preserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the model's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the original training data. By embedding the refusal direction directly into the model's weights, the suppression mechanism becomes inherently more robust against adversarial bypass attempts compared to surface-level input-output filters. In a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that we can neutralize a variety of harmful contents, including explicit nudity, graphic violence, copyrights, and trademarks.

| **[PolyVivid: Vivid Multi-Subject Video Generation with Cross-Modal Interaction and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07848v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in video generation, existing models still lack fine-grained controllability, especially for multi-subject customization with consistent identity and interaction. In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a multi-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and identity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between subject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion module that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise grounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift. Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing open-source and commercial baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Video Editing as Flow-Driven Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07713v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[RainFusion: Adaptive Video Generation Acceleration via Multi-Dimensional Visual Redundancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21036v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation using diffusion models is highly computationally intensive, with 3D attention in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models accounting for over 80\% of the total computational resources. In this work, we introduce {\bf RainFusion}, a novel training-free sparse attention method that exploits inherent sparsity nature in visual data to accelerate attention computation while preserving video quality. Specifically, we identify three unique sparse patterns in video generation attention calculations--Spatial Pattern, Temporal Pattern and Textural Pattern. The sparse pattern for each attention head is determined online with negligible overhead (\textasciitilde\,0.2\%) with our proposed {\bf ARM} (Adaptive Recognition Module) during inference. Our proposed {\bf RainFusion} is a plug-and-play method, that can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art 3D-attention video generation models without additional training or calibration. We evaluate our method on leading open-sourced models including HunyuanVideo, OpenSoraPlan-1.2 and CogVideoX-5B, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that RainFusion achieves over {\bf 2\(\times\)} speedup in attention computation while maintaining video quality, with only a minimal impact on VBench scores (-0.2\%).</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Long-duration Talking Video Synthesis with Linear Diffusion Transformer under Multimodal Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16748v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Portrait image animation using audio has rapidly advanced, but challenges remain in efficiently fusing multimodal inputs while ensuring temporal and portrait consistency with minimal computational cost. To address this, we present LetsTalk, a LinEar diffusion TranSformer for Talking video synthesis. LetsTalk incorporates a deep compression autoencoder to obtain efficient latent representations, and a spatio-temporal-aware transformer with efficient linear attention to effectively fuse multimodal information and enhance spatio-temporal consistency. We systematically explore and summarize three fusion schemes, ranging from shallow to deep fusion. We thoroughly analyze their characteristics, applicability, and trade-offs, thereby bridging critical gaps in multimodal conditional guidance. Based on modality differences of image, audio, and video generation, we adopt deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait to ensure consistency, and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio to align animation with speech while preserving motion diversity. To maintain temporal consistency in long-duration video generation, we propose a memory bank mechanism that preserves inter-clip dependencies, effectively preventing degradation across extended sequences. Furthermore, we develop a noise-regularized training strategy that explicitly compensates for DDPM sampling artifacts, significantly improving the model's robustness in continuous generation scenarios.Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, while maintaining remarkable efficiency through its optimized model design with 8$\times$ fewer parameters.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Astraea: A GPU-Oriented Token-wise Acceleration Framework for Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05096v3)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting their applicability. We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs) while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods (<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generation to Generalization: Emergent Few-Shot Learning in Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07280v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools, capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation models in vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 23 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[TV-LiVE: Training-Free, Text-Guided Video Editing via Layer Informed Vitality Exploitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07205v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video editing has garnered increasing attention alongside the rapid progress of diffusion-based video generation models. As part of these advancements, there is a growing demand for more accessible and controllable forms of video editing, such as prompt-based editing. Previous studies have primarily focused on tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution, and attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the source video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel objects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing framework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify vital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the quality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method enables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively injecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding layers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition, we further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding to the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the prominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental results demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both object addition and non-rigid video editing. Project Page: https://emjay73.github.io/TV_LiVE/</p></details> |  |
| **[Frame Guidance: Training-Free Guidance for Frame-Level Control in Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07177v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video quality, directing attention to fine-grained controllability. However, many existing methods depend on fine-tuning large-scale video models for specific tasks, which becomes increasingly impractical as model sizes continue to grow. In this work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and looping, without any training, compatible with any video models. Experimental results show that Frame Guidance can produce high-quality controlled videos for a wide range of tasks and input signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://frame-guidance-video.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Hi-VAE: Efficient Video Autoencoding with Global and Detailed Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07136v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in video autoencoders (Video AEs) have advanced video generation, but existing methods fail to efficiently model spatio-temporal redundancies in dynamics, resulting in suboptimal compression factors. This shortfall leads to excessive training costs for downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce Hi-VAE, an efficient video autoencoding framework that hierarchically encode coarse-to-fine motion representations of video dynamics and formulate the decoding process as a conditional generation task. Specifically, Hi-VAE decomposes video dynamics into two latent spaces: Global Motion, capturing overarching motion patterns, and Detailed Motion, encoding high-frequency spatial details. Using separate self-supervised motion encoders, we compress video latents into compact motion representations to reduce redundancy significantly. A conditional diffusion decoder then reconstructs videos by combining hierarchical global and detailed motions, enabling high-fidelity video reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-VAE achieves a high compression factor of 1428$\times$, almost 30$\times$ higher than baseline methods (e.g., Cosmos-VAE at 48$\times$), validating the efficiency of our approach. Meanwhile, Hi-VAE maintains high reconstruction quality at such high compression rates and performs effectively in downstream generative tasks. Moreover, Hi-VAE exhibits interpretability and scalability, providing new perspectives for future exploration in video latent representation and generation.</p></details> |  |

As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of $O(N^2)$, compared to $O(N)$ for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs almost no end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

| **[SageAttention2: Efficient Attention with Thorough Outlier Smoothing and Per-thread INT4 Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10958v6)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrices $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrices $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK^\top$. Third, we propose a two-level accumulation strategy for $\widetilde PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 4.5x on RTX4090, respectively. Moreover, SageAttention2 matches the speed of FlashAttention3(fp8) on the Hopper GPUs, while delivering much higher accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for language, image, and video generation.

| **[An Online Learning Approach to Prompt-based Selection of Generative Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13287v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selecting a sample generation scheme from multiple prompt-based generative models, including large language models (LLMs) and prompt-guided image and video generation models, is typically addressed by choosing the model that maximizes an averaged evaluation score. However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types.

| **[HAIC: Improving Human Action Understanding and Generation with Better Captions for Multi-modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20811v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made great progress in video understanding. However, their performance on videos involving human actions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to accumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second, videos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human attributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions and interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely HAICTrain and HAICBench. \textbf{HAICTrain} comprises 126K video-caption pairs generated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes. Meanwhile, \textbf{HAICBench} includes 412 manually annotated video-caption pairs and 2,000 QA pairs, for a comprehensive evaluation of human action understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that training with HAICTrain not only significantly enhances human understanding abilities across 4 benchmarks, but can also improve text-to-video generation results. Both the HAICTrain and HAICBench are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/KuaishouHAIC/HAIC.</p></details> |  |

We validate the quality of our proposed dataset in terms of visual fidelity and textual caption accuracy using state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and video generation models, respectively. We further introduce a Long Narrative Video Director to enhance both visual and semantic coherence in generated videos and emphasize the role of aligning visual embeddings to achieve improved overall video quality.

| **[Self-Adapting Improvement Loops for Robotic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06658v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks. However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories, collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through self-improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Diffusability of Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14831v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for generating high-quality images and videos, utilizing compressed latent representations to reduce the computational burden of the diffusion process. While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K $256^2$ and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 $17 \times 256^2$.

| **[Restereo: Diffusion stereo video generation and restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06023v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SageAttention2++: A More Efficient Implementation of SageAttention2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21136v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows quadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing quantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8 Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++ achieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpargeAttention: Accurate and Training-free Sparse Attention Accelerating Any Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18137v5)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

However, their substantial computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges. Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions, which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking, listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX 4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45 FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140 ms and 215 ms, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding.

Current datasets, such as Ego4D, often suffer from inconsistent view perspectives and misaligned interactions, leading to reduced video quality and limiting their applicability for precise imitation learning tasks. Towards this end, we introduce TASTE-Rob -- a pioneering large-scale dataset of 100,856 ego-centric hand-object interaction videos. Each video is meticulously aligned with language instructions and recorded from a consistent camera viewpoint to ensure interaction clarity. By fine-tuning a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) on TASTE-Rob, we achieve realistic object interactions, though we observed occasional inconsistencies in hand grasping postures. To enhance realism, we introduce a three-stage pose-refinement pipeline that improves hand posture accuracy in generated videos. Our curated dataset, coupled with the specialized pose-refinement framework, provides notable performance gains in generating high-quality, task-oriented hand-object interaction videos, resulting in achieving superior generalizable robotic manipulation.

Although both quantization and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to the lack of joint optimization. We introduce FPSAttention, a novel training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation, with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fps.ziplab.co</p></details> |

Existing methods often struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries, leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality, physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video generation.</p></details> |  |

ContentV generates diverse, high-quality videos across multiple resolutions and durations from text prompts, enabled by three key innovations: (1) A minimalist architecture that maximizes reuse of pre-trained image generation models for video generation; (2) A systematic multi-stage training strategy leveraging flow matching for enhanced efficiency; and (3) A cost-effective reinforcement learning with human feedback framework that improves generation quality without requiring additional human annotations.

This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the physical world understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image, and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and, shape and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or complex ray tracing.</p></details> |  |

Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations, including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only 23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior effectiveness and scalability.

Recent video generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision, which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment, which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[FullDiT2: Efficient In-Context Conditioning for Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04213v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained and efficient controllability on video diffusion transformers has raised increasing desires for the applicability. Recently, In-context Conditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video generation, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context conditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token sequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite their effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task complexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study the efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video generation framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key sources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within context condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent interactions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we propose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general controllability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates from two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2 leverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important context tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention. Additionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize redundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive experiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks demonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3 times speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal degradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

| **[SViMo: Synchronized Diffusion for Video and Motion Generation in Hand-object Interaction Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02444v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has significant application potential. However, current 3D HOI motion generation approaches heavily rely on predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, HOI video generation methods prioritize pixel-level visual fidelity, often sacrificing physical plausibility. Recognizing that visual appearance and motion patterns share fundamental physical laws in the real world, we propose a novel framework that combines visual priors and dynamic constraints within a synchronized diffusion process to generate the HOI video and motion simultaneously. To integrate the heterogeneous semantics, appearance, and motion features, our method implements tri-modal adaptive modulation for feature aligning, coupled with 3D full-attention for modeling inter- and intra-modal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates explicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion outputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This architecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit pose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency. Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences, with notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.

By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task, enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance, enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both quality and versatility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://follow-your-creation.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Fast Video Generation with Sliding Tile Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04507v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention power state-of-the-art video generation, but suffer from prohibitive compute cost -- when generating just a 5-second 720P video, attention alone takes 800 out of 945 seconds of total inference time. This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to address this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in pretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D windows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA eliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise sliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel hardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being hardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the first efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving 58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over FlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading video DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s without quality degradation, requiring no training. Enabling finetuning further lowers latency to 268s with only a 0.09% drop on VBench.

Given per-layer prompts, LayerFlow generates videos for the transparent foreground, clean background, and blended scene. It also supports versatile variants like decomposing a blended video or generating the background for the given foreground and vice versa. Starting from a text-to-video diffusion transformer, we organize the videos for different layers as sub-clips, and leverage layer embeddings to distinguish each clip and the corresponding layer-wise prompts. In this way, we seamlessly support the aforementioned variants in one unified framework. For the lack of high-quality layer-wise training videos, we design a multi-stage training strategy to accommodate static images with high-quality layer annotations. Specifically, we first train the model with low-quality video data. Then, we tune a motion LoRA to make the model compatible with static frames. Afterward, we train the content LoRA on the mixture of image data with high-quality layered images along with copy-pasted video data. During inference, we remove the motion LoRA thus generating smooth videos with desired layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sihuiji.github.io/LayerFlow-Page/</p></details> |
| **[UNIC: Unified In-Context Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04216v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video generation have sparked interest in generative video editing tasks. Previous methods often rely on task-specific architectures (e.g., additional adapter modules) or dedicated customizations (e.g., DDIM inversion), which limit the integration of versatile editing conditions and the unification of various editing tasks. In this paper, we introduce UNified In-Context Video Editing (UNIC), a simple yet effective framework that unifies diverse video editing tasks within a single model in an in-context manner. To achieve this unification, we represent the inputs of various video editing tasks as three types of tokens: the source video tokens, the noisy video latent, and the multi-modal conditioning tokens that vary according to the specific editing task. Based on this formulation, our key insight is to integrate these three types into a single consecutive token sequence and jointly model them using the native attention operations of DiT, thereby eliminating the need for task-specific adapter designs. Nevertheless, direct task unification under this framework is challenging, leading to severe token collisions and task confusion due to the varying video lengths and diverse condition modalities across tasks. To address these, we introduce task-aware RoPE to facilitate consistent temporal positional encoding, and condition bias that enables the model to clearly differentiate different editing tasks. This allows our approach to adaptively perform different video editing tasks by referring the source video and varying condition tokens "in context", and support flexible task composition. To validate our method, we construct a unified video editing benchmark containing six representative video editing tasks. Results demonstrate that our unified approach achieves superior performance on each task and exhibits emergent task composition abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is at \href{https://zixuan-ye.github.io/UNIC}{https://zixuan-ye.github.io/UNIC}</p></details> |

Existing approaches address this limitation by retraining the model or introducing external conditioning signals to enforce temporal consistency. In this work, we explore whether a meaningful temporal representation can be extracted directly from the predictions of a pre-trained model without any additional training or auxiliary inputs. We introduce FlowMo, a novel training-free guidance method that enhances motion coherence using only the model's own predictions in each diffusion step. FlowMo first derives an appearance-debiased temporal representation by measuring the distance between latents corresponding to consecutive frames. This highlights the implicit temporal structure predicted by the model. It then estimates motion coherence by measuring the patch-wise variance across the temporal dimension and guides the model to reduce this variance dynamically during sampling. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-video models demonstrate that FlowMo significantly improves motion coherence without sacrificing visual quality or prompt alignment, offering an effective plug-and-play solution for enhancing the temporal fidelity of pre-trained video diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

To obtain training data, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated from independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained comparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion clips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce DenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three contributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted copies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar motion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing the motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label preferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and more precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO greatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text alignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that DenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences similar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO trained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/DenseDPO/</p></details> |

In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

| **[Chipmunk: Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion Transformers with Dynamic Column-Sparse Deltas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03275v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in high-quality image and video generation but incur substantial compute cost at inference. A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly across inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant across steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this redundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change between steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25% of the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations across steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic sparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate activations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems challenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU tensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and caching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges, Chipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce column-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient sparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at 93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk overlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other parts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra latency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on FLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that Chipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup on HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev with minimal quality impact.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose IllumiCraft, an end-to-end diffusion framework accepting three complementary inputs: (1) high-dynamic-range (HDR) video maps for detailed lighting control; (2) synthetically relit frames with randomized illumination changes (optionally paired with a static background reference image) to provide appearance cues; and (3) 3D point tracks that capture precise 3D geometry information. By integrating the lighting, appearance, and geometry cues within a unified diffusion architecture, IllumiCraft generates temporally coherent videos aligned with user-defined prompts. It supports background-conditioned and text-conditioned video relighting and provides better fidelity than existing controllable video generation methods.

In this work, we propose Context-as-Memory, which utilizes historical context as memory for video generation. It includes two simple yet effective designs: (1) storing context in frame format without additional post-processing; (2) conditioning by concatenating context and frames to be predicted along the frame dimension at the input, requiring no external control modules. Furthermore, considering the enormous computational overhead of incorporating all historical context, we propose the Memory Retrieval module to select truly relevant context frames by determining FOV (Field of View) overlap between camera poses, which significantly reduces the number of candidate frames without substantial information loss. Experiments demonstrate that Context-as-Memory achieves superior memory capabilities in interactive long video generation compared to SOTAs, even generalizing effectively to open-domain scenarios not seen during training.

CamCloneMaster seamlessly supports reference-based camera control for both Image-to-Video and Video-to-Video tasks within a unified framework. Furthermore, we present the Camera Clone Dataset, a large-scale synthetic dataset designed for camera clone learning, encompassing diverse scenes, subjects, and camera movements.

To produce engaging animations, it is essential to generate coherent multi-shot video clips with narrative scripts and character references. However, existing public datasets primarily focus on real-world scenarios with global descriptions, and lack reference images for consistent character guidance. To bridge this gap, we present AnimeShooter, a reference-guided multi-shot animation dataset. AnimeShooter features comprehensive hierarchical annotations and strong visual consistency across shots through an automated pipeline. Story-level annotations provide an overview of the narrative, including the storyline, key scenes, and main character profiles with reference images, while shot-level annotations decompose the story into consecutive shots, each annotated with scene, characters, and both narrative and descriptive visual captions. Additionally, a dedicated subset, AnimeShooter-audio, offers synchronized audio tracks for each shot, along with audio descriptions and sound sources. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AnimeShooter and establish a baseline for the reference-guided multi-shot video generation task, we introduce AnimeShooterGen, which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video diffusion models. The reference image and previously generated shots are first processed by MLLM to produce representations aware of both reference and context, which are then used as the condition for the diffusion model to decode the subsequent shot. Experimental results show that the model trained on AnimeShooter achieves superior cross-shot visual consistency and adherence to reference visual guidance, which highlight the value of our dataset for coherent animated video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project released at: https://qiulu66.github.io/animeshooter/</p></details> |

Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)}, where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert specialization in video diffusion model distillation.

Recently, action-driven generative models have gained widespread adoption in robot learning and simulation, as they eliminate safety concerns and reduce maintenance efforts. However, the action sequences used in these methods often result in limited control precision and poor generalization due to their globally coarse alignment. To address these limitations, we propose ORV, an Occupancy-centric Robot Video generation framework, which utilizes 4D semantic occupancy sequences as a fine-grained representation to provide more accurate semantic and geometric guidance for video generation. By leveraging occupancy-based representations, ORV enables seamless translation of simulation data into photorealistic robot videos, while ensuring high temporal consistency and precise controllability. Furthermore, our framework supports the simultaneous generation of multi-view videos of robot gripping operations - an important capability for downstream robotic learning tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ORV consistently outperforms existing baseline methods across various datasets and sub-tasks.

| **[Sparse-vDiT: Unleashing the Power of Sparse Attention to Accelerate Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03065v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved breakthroughs in video generation, this long sequence generation task remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, resulting in significant inference latency. Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video Diffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns: diagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\% attention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong layer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the input content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity acceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels that replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for each identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search algorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and head via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal configuration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same attention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into state-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1), Sparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\times$, 2.38$\times$, and 1.67$\times$ theoretical FLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\times$, 1.85$\times$, and 1.58$\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with PSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59. Our work demonstrates that latent structural sparsity in vDiTs can be systematically exploited for long video synthesis.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap and facilitate research in optical flow estimation and downstream tasks such as anime video generation and line drawing colorization, we introduce LinkTo-Anime, the first high-quality dataset specifically designed for cel anime character motion generated with 3D model rendering. LinkTo-Anime provides rich annotations including forward and backward optical flow, occlusion masks, and Mixamo Skeleton. The dataset comprises 395 video sequences, totally 24,230 training frames, 720 validation frames, and 4,320 test frames.

To establish the infrastructure for S2V generation, we propose OpenS2V-Nexus, consisting of (i) OpenS2V-Eval, a fine-grained benchmark, and (ii) OpenS2V-5M, a million-scale dataset. In contrast to existing S2V benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data. Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 18 representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and Dataset: https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/OpenS2V-Nexus</p></details> |

In this work, we present OmniTalker, a unified framework that jointly generates synchronized talking audio-video content from input text while emulating the speaking and facial movement styles of the target identity, including speech characteristics, head motion, and facial dynamics. Our framework adopts a dual-branch diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, with one branch dedicated to audio generation and the other to video synthesis. At the shallow layers, cross-modal fusion modules are introduced to integrate information between the two modalities. In deeper layers, each modality is processed independently, with the generated audio decoded by a vocoder and the video rendered using a GAN-based high-quality visual renderer. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of DiT through a masked-infilling strategy, our model can simultaneously capture both audio and visual styles without requiring explicit style extraction modules. Thanks to the efficiency of the DiT backbone and the optimized visual renderer, OmniTalker achieves real-time inference at 25 FPS. To the best of our knowledge, OmniTalker is the first one-shot framework capable of jointly modeling speech and facial styles in real time. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in terms of generation quality, particularly in preserving style consistency and ensuring precise audio-video synchronization, all while maintaining efficient inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page https://humanaigc.github.io/omnitalker</p></details> |

However, these methods still encounter significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range, controllability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in comparison to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LumosFlow: Motion-Guided Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02497v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video generation has gained increasing attention due to its widespread applications in fields such as entertainment and simulation. Despite advances, synthesizing temporally coherent and visually compelling long sequences remains a formidable challenge. Conventional approaches often synthesize long videos by sequentially generating and concatenating short clips, or generating key frames and then interpolate the intermediate frames in a hierarchical manner. However, both of them still remain significant challenges, leading to issues such as temporal repetition or unnatural transitions. In this paper, we revisit the hierarchical long video generation pipeline and introduce LumosFlow, a framework introduce motion guidance explicitly. Specifically, we first employ the Large Motion Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (LMTV-DM) to generate key frames with larger motion intervals, thereby ensuring content diversity in the generated long videos. Given the complexity of interpolating contextual transitions between key frames, we further decompose the intermediate frame interpolation into motion generation and post-hoc refinement. For each pair of key frames, the Latent Optical Flow Diffusion Model (LOF-DM) synthesizes complex and large-motion optical flows, while MotionControlNet subsequently refines the warped results to enhance quality and guide intermediate frame generation. Compared with traditional video frame interpolation, we achieve 15x interpolation, ensuring reasonable and continuous motion between adjacent frames. Experiments show that our method can generate long videos with consistent motion and appearance. Code and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Existing detection methods, while effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos, which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos, enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric video forensics.</p></details> |  |

Using a reference video and conditional signals such as music or motion tags, the system synthesizes new videos by first retrieving video clips with gestures matching the conditions and then generating interpolation frames to seamlessly connect clip boundaries. The core of our approach is HMInterp, a robust Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) model that enables seamless interpolation of discontinuous frames, even for complex motion scenarios like dancing. HMInterp i) employs a dual-branch interpolation approach, combining a Motion Diffusion Model for human skeleton motion interpolation with a diffusion-based video frame interpolation model for final frame generation. ii) adopts condition progressive training to effectively leverage identity strong and weak conditions, such as images and pose. These designs ensure both high video texture quality and accurate motion trajectory. Results show that our Video Motion Graphs outperforms existing generative- and retrieval-based methods for multi-modal conditioned human motion video generation.

However, current approaches predominantly rely on statistical learning from vast datasets without explicitly modeling the underlying physics of motion, resulting in subtle yet perceptible non-physical artifacts that diminish the realism of generated videos. This paper introduces a physics-informed frequency domain approach to enhance the physical plausibility of generated videos. We first conduct a systematic analysis of the frequency-domain characteristics of diverse physical motions (translation, rotation, scaling), revealing that each motion type exhibits distinctive and identifiable spectral signatures. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose two complementary components: (1) a physical motion loss function that quantifies and optimizes the conformity of generated videos to ideal frequency-domain motion patterns, and (2) a frequency domain enhancement module that progressively learns to adjust video features to conform to physical motion constraints while preserving original network functionality through a zero-initialization strategy. Experiments across multiple video diffusion architectures demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances motion quality and physical plausibility without compromising visual quality or semantic alignment. Our frequency-domain physical motion framework generalizes effectively across different video generation architectures, offering a principled approach to incorporating physical constraints into deep learning-based video synthesis pipelines. This work seeks to establish connections between data-driven models and physics-based motion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Video Generation for Robotic Manipulation with Collaborative Trajectory Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01943v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

Although video generation is widely applied in various fields, most existing models are limited to single scenarios and cannot perform diverse video generation and editing through dynamic content manipulation. We propose OmniV2V, a video model capable of generating and editing videos across different scenarios based on various operations, including: object movement, object addition, mask-guided video edit, try-on, inpainting, outpainting, human animation, and controllable character video synthesis. We explore a unified dynamic content manipulation injection module, which effectively integrates the requirements of the above tasks. In addition, we design a visual-text instruction module based on LLaVA, enabling the model to effectively understand the correspondence between visual content and instructions. Furthermore, we build a comprehensive multi-task data processing system. Since there is data overlap among various tasks, this system can efficiently provide data augmentation. Using this system, we construct a multi-type, multi-scenario OmniV2V dataset and its corresponding OmniV2V-Test benchmark. Extensive experiments show that OmniV2V works as well as, and sometimes better than, the best existing open-source and commercial models for many video generation and editing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Many-for-Many: Unify the Training of Multiple Video and Image Generation and Manipulation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01758v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many visual generation and manipulation tasks. Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines. Our models and source codes are available at https://github.com/leeruibin/MfM.git.</p></details> |  |

However, existing query-answer datasets primarily focus on textual responses, making it challenging to address complex user queries that require visual demonstrations or explanations for better understanding. To bridge this gap, we construct a benchmark, RealVideoQuest, designed to evaluate the abilities of text-to-video (T2V) models in answering real-world, visually grounded queries. It identifies 7.5K real user queries with video response intents from Chatbot-Arena and builds 4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage video retrieval and refinement process. We further develop a multi-angle evaluation system to assess the quality of generated video answers. Experiments indicate that current T2V models struggle with effectively addressing real user queries, pointing to key challenges and future research opportunities in multimodal AI.</p></details> |  |

However, current models often suffer serious error accumulations when predicting the long-term future, which limits the practical application. Recent studies utilize the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as the backbone of driving world models to improve learning flexibility. However, these models are always trained on short video clips (high fps and short duration), and multiple roll-out generations struggle to produce consistent and reasonable long videos due to the training-inference gap. To this end, we propose several solutions to build a simple yet effective long-term driving world model. First, we hierarchically decouple world model learning into large motion learning and bidirectional continuous motion learning. Then, considering the continuity of driving scenes, we propose a simple distillation method where fine-grained video flows are self-supervised signals for coarse-grained flows. The distillation is designed to improve the coherence of infinite video generation. The coarse-grained and fine-grained modules are coordinated to generate long-term and temporally coherent videos. In the public benchmark NuScenes, compared with the state-of-the-art front-view model, our model improves FVD by $27\%$ and reduces inference time by $85\%$ for the video task of generating 110+ frames.

However, existing datasets suffer from severe limitations: (1) data scarcity due to the long-tail nature of real-world anomalies, and (2) privacy constraints that impede large-scale collection. To address the aforementioned issues in one go, we introduce SVTA (Synthetic Video-Text Anomaly benchmark), the first large-scale dataset for cross-modal anomaly retrieval, leveraging generative models to overcome data availability challenges. Specifically, we collect and generate video descriptions via the off-the-shelf LLM (Large Language Model) covering 68 anomaly categories, e.g., throwing, stealing, and shooting. These descriptions encompass common long-tail events. We adopt these texts to guide the video generative model to produce diverse and high-quality videos. Finally, our SVTA involves 41,315 videos (1.36M frames) with paired captions, covering 30 normal activities, e.g., standing, walking, and sports, and 68 anomalous events, e.g., falling, fighting, theft, explosions, and natural disasters. We adopt three widely-used video-text retrieval baselines to comprehensively test our SVTA, revealing SVTA's challenging nature and its effectiveness in evaluating a robust cross-modal retrieval method.

| **[DiffuseSlide: Training-Free High Frame Rate Video Generation Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01454v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, enabling the creation of high-quality, temporally consistent videos. However, generating high frame-rate (FPS) videos remains a significant challenge due to issues such as flickering and degradation in long sequences, particularly in fast-motion scenarios. Existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiencies and limitations in maintaining video quality over extended frames. In this paper, we present a novel, training-free approach for high FPS video generation using pre-trained diffusion models. Our method, DiffuseSlide, introduces a new pipeline that leverages key frames from low FPS videos and applies innovative techniques, including noise re-injection and sliding window latent denoising, to achieve smooth, consistent video outputs without the need for additional fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves video quality, offering enhanced temporal coherence and spatial fidelity. The proposed method is not only computationally efficient but also adaptable to various video generation tasks, making it ideal for applications such as virtual reality, video games, and high-quality content creation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Text-to-Video Alignment with Diffusion Latent Beam Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19252v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress in text-to-video diffusion models enables photorealistic generations, although the contents of the generated video often include unnatural movement or deformation, reverse playback, and motionless scenes. Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some quantity on the goodness of the content. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward, at inference time. We then point out that the improvement of perceptual video quality considering the alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline that we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into lookahead steps for reward estimation over search budget or denoising steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/shim0114/T2V-Diffusion-Search</p></details> |
| **[DeepVerse: 4D Autoregressive Video Generation as a World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01103v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models serve as essential building blocks toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), enabling intelligent agents to predict future states and plan actions by simulating complex physical interactions. However, existing interactive models primarily predict visual observations, thereby neglecting crucial hidden states like geometric structures and spatial coherence. This leads to rapid error accumulation and temporal inconsistency. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepVerse, a novel 4D interactive world model explicitly incorporating geometric predictions from previous timesteps into current predictions conditioned on actions. Experiments demonstrate that by incorporating explicit geometric constraints, DeepVerse captures richer spatio-temporal relationships and underlying physical dynamics. This capability significantly reduces drift and enhances temporal consistency, enabling the model to reliably generate extended future sequences and achieve substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, visual realism, and scene rationality. Furthermore, our method provides an effective solution for geometry-aware memory retrieval, effectively preserving long-term spatial consistency. We validate the effectiveness of DeepVerse across diverse scenarios, establishing its capacity for high-fidelity, long-horizon predictions grounded in geometry-aware dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLZero: Direct Policy Inference from Language Without In-Domain Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05718v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reward hypothesis states that all goals and purposes can be understood as the maximization of a received scalar reward signal. However, in practice, defining such a reward signal is notoriously difficult, as humans are often unable to predict the optimal behavior corresponding to a reward function. Natural language offers an intuitive alternative for instructing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, yet previous language-conditioned approaches either require costly supervision or test-time training given a language instruction. In this work, we present a new approach that uses a pretrained RL agent trained using only unlabeled, offline interactions--without task-specific supervision or labeled trajectories--to get zero-shot test-time policy inference from arbitrary natural language instructions. We introduce a framework comprising three steps: imagine, project, and imitate. First, the agent imagines a sequence of observations corresponding to the provided language description using video generative models. Next, these imagined observations are projected into the target environment domain. Finally, an agent pretrained in the target environment with unsupervised RL instantly imitates the projected observation sequence through a closed-form solution. To the best of our knowledge, our method, RLZero, is the first approach to show direct language-to-behavior generation abilities on a variety of tasks and environments without any in-domain supervision. We further show that components of RLZero can be used to generate policies zero-shot from cross-embodied videos, such as those available on YouTube, even for complex embodiments like humanoids.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Existing fine-tuning methods for conditional generation often rely on external encoders or architectural modifications, which demand large datasets and are typically restricted to spatially aligned conditioning, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT), an efficient and versatile approach for adapting pretrained video diffusion models to diverse conditional generation tasks. Our key idea is to concatenate condition and target frames along the temporal axis and insert intermediate buffer frames with progressively increasing noise levels. These buffer frames enable smooth transitions, aligning the fine-tuning process with the pretrained model's temporal dynamics. TIC-FT requires no architectural changes and achieves strong performance with as few as 10-30 training samples. We validate our method across a range of tasks, including image-to-video and video-to-video generation, using large-scale base models such as CogVideoX-5B and Wan-14B. Extensive experiments show that TIC-FT outperforms existing baselines in both condition fidelity and visual quality, while remaining highly efficient in both training and inference.

| **[Video Signature: In-generation Watermarking for Latent Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00652v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has led to significant progress in video generation but also raises serious concerns about intellectual property protection and reliable content tracing. Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, but existing methods for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which introduces additional computational overhead and often fails to effectively balance the trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. To address these issues, we propose Video Signature (VIDSIG), an in-generation watermarking method for latent video diffusion models, which enables implicit and adaptive watermark integration during generation. Specifically, we achieve this by partially fine-tuning the latent decoder, where Perturbation-Aware Suppression (PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal consistency by introducing a lightweight Temporal Alignment module that guides the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning. Experimental results show that VIDSIG achieves the best overall performance in watermark extraction, visual quality, and generation efficiency. It also demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tampering, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Robot Policies in a World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00613v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotics has broad applications from automating house chores to taking care of patients. However, evaluating robot control policies is challenging, as real-world testing is expensive, while handcrafted simulations often fail to accurately reflect real-world conditions, resulting in poor correlation between simulated evaluation and real-world outcomes. In this work, we investigate World-model-based Policy Evaluation (WPE). We first train an action-conditioned video generation model as a proxy to real-world environments. To enable efficient rollouts of hundreds of interactive steps while mitigating error accumulation in the world model, we propose an inference scheme which we call Blockwise-Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer with adjustable context and decoding horizon lengths. To ensure that the world model indeed follows action input, we propose metrics based on the agreement between the ground truth video and generated video conditioned on the same sequence of actions to evaluate the world model. We then use the world model for policy evaluation by performing Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model while employing a vision-language model (VLM) as a reward function. Interestingly, we found that WPE tends to underestimate the policy values for in-distribution actions and overestimate policy values for out-of-distribution actions. Nevertheless, WPE preserves the relative rankings of different policies. In emulating real robot executions, WPE achieves high fidelity in mimicing robot arm movements as in real videos, while emulating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging. Despite this limitation, we show that a world model can serve as a starting point for evaluating robot policies before real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-model-eval.github.io</p></details> |

Existing approaches primarily focus on synthesizing individual ground-view images, often relying on auxiliary inputs like height maps or handcrafted projections, and fall short in producing temporally consistent sequences. In this paper, we propose {SatDreamer360}, a novel framework that generates geometrically and temporally consistent ground-view video from a single satellite image and a predefined trajectory. To bridge the large viewpoint gap, we introduce a compact tri-plane representation that encodes scene geometry directly from the satellite image. A ray-based pixel attention mechanism retrieves view-dependent features from the tri-plane, enabling accurate cross-view correspondence without requiring additional geometric priors. To ensure multi-frame consistency, we propose an epipolar-constrained temporal attention module that aligns features across frames using the known relative poses along the trajectory. To support evaluation, we introduce {VIGOR++}, a large-scale dataset for cross-view video generation, with dense trajectory annotations and high-quality ground-view sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SatDreamer360 achieves superior performance in fidelity, coherence, and geometric alignment across diverse urban scenes.</p></details> |  |

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the representation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by TMLR</p></details> |

We decouple skeletal and motion priors from pose information, enabling precise control over animation generation.

However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality. We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to 1.63x end-to-end speedup, while maintaining video quality.

Improving traffic safety requires realistic and controllable accident simulations. To tackle the problem, we propose Ctrl-Crash, a controllable car crash video generation model that conditions on signals such as bounding boxes, crash types, and an initial image frame. Our approach enables counterfactual scenario generation where minor variations in input can lead to dramatically different crash outcomes. To support fine-grained control at inference time, we leverage classifier-free guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal. Ctrl-Crash achieves state-of-the-art performance across quantitative video quality metrics (e.g., FVD and JEDi) and qualitative measurements based on a human-evaluation of physical realism and video quality compared to prior diffusion-based methods.</p></details> | Under review |

However, video object removal, a critical subtask of video editing, remains challenging due to issues such as hallucinated objects and visual artifacts. Furthermore, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive sampling procedures and classifier-free guidance (CFG), resulting in slow inference. To address these limitations, we propose MiniMax-Remover, a novel two-stage video object removal approach. Motivated by the observation that text condition is not best suited for this task, we simplify the pretrained video generation model by removing textual input and cross-attention layers, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient model architecture in the first stage. In the second stage, we distilled our remover on successful videos produced by the stage-1 model and curated by human annotators, using a minimax optimization strategy to further improve editing quality and inference speed. Specifically, the inner maximization identifies adversarial input noise ("bad noise") that makes failure removals, while the outer minimization step trains the model to generate high-quality removal results even under such challenging conditions. As a result, our method achieves a state-of-the-art video object removal results with as few as 6 sampling steps and doesn't rely on CFG, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of MiniMax-Remover compared to existing methods.

To achieve this, we re-formulate the animation task as two inpainting-based steps: Camera-aware Scene Inpainting and Pose-aware Video Inpainting. The first step leverages a pre-trained image inpainting model to generate multi-view scene images from the reference art and optimizes a stable large-scale Gaussian field, which enables coarse background video rendering with camera trajectories. However, the rendered video is rough and only conveys scene motion. To resolve this, the second step trains a pose-aware video inpainting model that injects the dynamic character into the scene video while enhancing background quality. Specifically, this model is a DiT-based video generation model with a gating strategy that adaptively integrates the character's appearance and pose information into the base background video. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of DreamDance, producing high-quality and consistent character animations with remarkable camera dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniGeo: Taming Video Diffusion for Unified Consistent Geometry Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24521v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, methods leveraging diffusion model priors to assist monocular geometric estimation (e.g., depth and normal) have gained significant attention due to their strong generalization ability. However, most existing works focus on estimating geometric properties within the camera coordinate system of individual video frames, neglecting the inherent ability of diffusion models to determine inter-frame correspondence. In this work, we demonstrate that, through appropriate design and fine-tuning, the intrinsic consistency of video generation models can be effectively harnessed for consistent geometric estimation. Specifically, we 1) select geometric attributes in the global coordinate system that share the same correspondence with video frames as the prediction targets, 2) introduce a novel and efficient conditioning method by reusing positional encodings, and 3) enhance performance through joint training on multiple geometric attributes that share the same correspondence. Our results achieve superior performance in predicting global geometric attributes in videos and can be directly applied to reconstruction tasks. Even when trained solely on static video data, our approach exhibits the potential to generalize to dynamic video scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sunyangtian.github.io/UniGeo-web/</p></details> |

However, enabling Interactive Video Generation (IVG), where users control motion elements such as object trajectory, remains challenging. Recent training-free approaches introduce attention masking to guide trajectory, but this often degrades perceptual quality. We identify two key failure modes in these methods, both of which we interpret as domain shift problems, and propose solutions inspired by domain adaptation. First, we attribute the perceptual degradation to internal covariate shift induced by attention masking, as pretrained models are not trained to handle masked attention. To address this, we propose mask normalization, a pre-normalization layer designed to mitigate this shift via distribution matching. Second, we address initialization gap, where the randomly sampled initial noise does not align with IVG conditioning, by introducing a temporal intrinsic diffusion prior that enforces spatio-temporal consistency at each denoising step. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that mask normalization and temporal intrinsic denoising improve both perceptual quality and trajectory control over the existing state-of-the-art IVG techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Because high-quality generations with DMs typically require a large number of function evaluations (NFEs), resulting in slow sampling, there has been extensive research successfully reducing the NFE to a small range (<10) while maintaining acceptable image quality. However, many practical applications, such as those involving Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and SANA, commonly operate in the mid-NFE regime (20-50 NFE) to achieve superior results, and, despite the practical relevance, research on the effective sampling within this mid-NFE regime remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free, and structure-independent DM ODE solver called the Stabilized Taylor Orthogonal Runge--Kutta (STORK) method, based on a class of stiff ODE solvers with a Taylor expansion adaptation. Unlike prior work such as DPM-Solver, which is dependent on the semi-linear structure of the DM ODE, STORK is applicable to any DM sampling, including noise-based and flow matching-based models. Within the 20-50 NFE range, STORK achieves improved generation quality, as measured by FID scores, across unconditional pixel-level generation and conditional latent-space generation tasks using models like Stable Diffusion 3.5 and SANA.

However, previous methods either rely solely on pixel-based VDMs, which come with high computational costs, or on latent-based VDMs, which often struggle with precise text-video alignment. In this paper, we are the first to propose a hybrid model, dubbed as Show-1, which marries pixel-based and latent-based VDMs for text-to-video generation. Our model first uses pixel-based VDMs to produce a low-resolution video of strong text-video correlation. After that, we propose a novel expert translation method that employs the latent-based VDMs to further upsample the low-resolution video to high resolution, which can also remove potential artifacts and corruptions from low-resolution videos. Compared to latent VDMs, Show-1 can produce high-quality videos of precise text-video alignment; Compared to pixel VDMs, Show-1 is much more efficient (GPU memory usage during inference is 15G vs 72G). Furthermore, our Show-1 model can be readily adapted for motion customization and video stylization applications through simple temporal attention layer finetuning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard video generation benchmarks.

However, existing methods rely largely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits generalization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation. To tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video Crafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences (i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT (4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens. Compared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust spatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image and character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we introduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention with 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as 4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D world. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new direction for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our MTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98, surpassing the second-best by 65%. Powered by robust motion tokens, MTVCrafter also generalizes well to diverse open-world characters (single/multiple, full/half-body) across various styles and scenarios.

However, video generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features. Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing open-source and commercial baselines.

However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt, demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit video generation.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

However, current T2V models often struggle to generate physically plausible content due to their limited inherent ability to accurately understand physics. We found that while the representations within T2V models possess some capacity for physics understanding, they lag significantly behind those from recent video self-supervised learning methods. To this end, we propose a novel framework called VideoREPA, which distills physics understanding capability from video understanding foundation models into T2V models by aligning token-level relations. This closes the physics understanding gap and enable more physics-plausible generation. Specifically, we introduce the Token Relation Distillation (TRD) loss, leveraging spatio-temporal alignment to provide soft guidance suitable for finetuning powerful pre-trained T2V models, a critical departure from prior representation alignment (REPA) methods. To our knowledge, VideoREPA is the first REPA method designed for finetuning T2V models and specifically for injecting physical knowledge.

Although large vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in caption generation, existing benchmarks inadequately address fine-grained evaluation, particularly in capturing spatial-temporal details critical for video generation. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Video Caption Evaluation Benchmark (VCapsBench), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark comprising 5,677 (5K+) videos and 109,796 (100K+) question-answer pairs. These QA-pairs are systematically annotated across 21 fine-grained dimensions (e.g., camera movement, and shot type) that are empirically proven critical for text-to-video generation. We further introduce three metrics (Accuracy (AR), Inconsistency Rate (IR), Coverage Rate (CR)), and an automated evaluation pipeline leveraging large language model (LLM) to verify caption quality via contrastive QA-pairs analysis. By providing actionable insights for caption optimization, our benchmark can advance the development of robust text-to-video models.

However, challenges remain in accurately modeling driving scenes and generating long videos. To alleviate these issues, we propose DreamForge, an advanced diffusion-based autoregressive video generation model tailored for 3D-controllable long-term generation. To enhance the lane and foreground generation, we introduce perspective guidance and integrate object-wise position encoding to incorporate local 3D correlation and improve foreground object modeling. We also propose motion-aware temporal attention to capture motion cues and appearance changes in videos. By leveraging motion frames and an autoregressive generation paradigm,we can autoregressively generate long videos (over 200 frames) using a model trained in short sequences, achieving superior quality compared to the baseline in 16-frame video evaluations. Finally, we integrate our method with the realistic simulator DriveArena to provide more reliable open-loop and closed-loop evaluations for vision-based driving agents.

Video Generative Models are Experts on Controllable Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23325v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generative models can be regarded as world simulators due to their ability to capture dynamic, continuous changes inherent in real-world environments. These models integrate high-dimensional information across visual, temporal, spatial, and causal dimensions, enabling predictions of subjects in various status. A natural and valuable research direction is to explore whether a fully trained video generative model in high-dimensional space can effectively support lower-dimensional tasks such as controllable image generation. In this work, we propose a paradigm for video-to-image knowledge compression and task adaptation, termed \textit{Dimension-Reduction Attack} (\texttt{DRA-Ctrl}), which utilizes the strengths of video models, including long-range context modeling and flatten full-attention, to perform various generation tasks. Specially, to address the challenging gap between continuous video frames and discrete image generation, we introduce a mixup-based transition strategy that ensures smooth adaptation. Moreover, we redesign the attention structure with a tailored masking mechanism to better align text prompts with image-level control. Experiments across diverse image generation tasks, such as subject-driven and spatially conditioned generation, show that repurposed video models outperform those trained directly on images. These results highlight the untapped potential of large-scale video generators for broader visual applications. \texttt{DRA-Ctrl} provides new insights into reusing resource-intensive video models and lays foundation for future unified generative models across visual modalities.

However, collecting large-scale real-world robot demonstrations is prohibitively expensive. Simulators offer a cost-effective alternative, but the sim-to-real gap make it extremely challenging to scale. Therefore, we introduce RoboTransfer, a diffusion-based video generation framework for robotic data synthesis. Unlike previous methods, RoboTransfer integrates multi-view geometry with explicit control over scene components, such as background and object attributes. By incorporating cross-view feature interactions and global depth/normal conditions, RoboTransfer ensures geometry consistency across views. This framework allows fine-grained control, including background edits and object swaps. Experiments demonstrate that RoboTransfer is capable of generating multi-view videos with enhanced geometric consistency and visual fidelity. In addition, policies trained on the data generated by RoboTransfer achieve a 33.3% relative improvement in the success rate in the DIFF-OBJ setting and a substantial 251% relative improvement in the more challenging DIFF-ALL scenario.

Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zero4dvid.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Zero-to-Hero: Zero-Shot Initialization Empowering Reference-Based Video Appearance Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23134v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Appearance editing according to user needs is a pivotal task in video editing. Existing text-guided methods often lead to ambiguities regarding user intentions and restrict fine-grained control over editing specific aspects of objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach named {Zero-to-Hero}, which focuses on reference-based video editing that disentangles the editing process into two distinct problems. It achieves this by first editing an anchor frame to satisfy user requirements as a reference image and then consistently propagating its appearance across other frames. We leverage correspondence within the original frames to guide the attention mechanism, which is more robust than previously proposed optical flow or temporal modules in memory-friendly video generative models, especially when dealing with objects exhibiting large motions. It offers a solid ZERO-shot initialization that ensures both accuracy and temporal consistency. However, intervention in the attention mechanism results in compounded imaging degradation with over-saturated colors and unknown blurring issues. Starting from Zero-Stage, our Hero-Stage Holistically learns a conditional generative model for vidEo RestOration. To accurately evaluate the consistency of the appearance, we construct a set of videos with multiple appearances using Blender, enabling a fine-grained and deterministic evaluation. Our method outperforms the best-performing baseline with a PSNR improvement of 2.6 dB. The project page is at https://github.com/Tonniia/Zero2Hero.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMGT: Motion Mask Guided Two-Stage Network for Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23120v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation aims to generate vivid speech videos from audio-driven still images, which is challenging due to the diversity of different parts of the body in terms of amplitude of motion, audio relevance, and detailed features. Relying solely on audio as the control signal often fails to capture large gesture movements in video, leading to more pronounced artifacts and distortions. Existing approaches typically address this issue by introducing additional a priori information, but this can limit the practical application of the task. Specifically, we propose a Motion Mask-Guided Two-Stage Network (MMGT) that uses audio, as well as motion masks and motion features generated from the audio signal to jointly drive the generation of synchronized speech gesture videos. In the first stage, the Spatial Mask-Guided Audio Pose Generation (SMGA) Network generates high-quality pose videos and motion masks from audio, effectively capturing large movements in key regions such as the face and gestures. In the second stage, we integrate the Motion Masked Hierarchical Audio Attention (MM-HAA) into the Stabilized Diffusion Video Generation model, overcoming limitations in fine-grained motion generation and region-specific detail control found in traditional methods. This guarantees high-quality, detailed upper-body video generation with accurate texture and motion details. Evaluations show improved video quality, lip-sync, and gesture. The model and code are available at https://github.com/SIA-IDE/MMGT.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoMan: Temporally Consistent Human Geometry Estimation using Image-to-Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23085v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating accurate and temporally consistent 3D human geometry from videos is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods, primarily optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos. GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size. To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D human geometry estimation from videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dair/geoman</p></details> |
| **[MOVi: Training-free Text-conditioned Multi-Object Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22980v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated remarkable progress, but these models still face challenges in generating videos with multiple objects. Most models struggle with accurately capturing complex object interactions, often treating some objects as static background elements and limiting their movement. In addition, they often fail to generate multiple distinct objects as specified in the prompt, resulting in incorrect generations or mixed features across objects. In this paper, we present a novel training-free approach for multi-object video generation that leverages the open world knowledge of diffusion models and large language models (LLMs). We use an LLM as the ``director'' of object trajectories, and apply the trajectories through noise re-initialization to achieve precise control of realistic movements. We further refine the generation process by manipulating the attention mechanism to better capture object-specific features and motion patterns, and prevent cross-object feature interference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our training free approach in significantly enhancing the multi-object generation capabilities of existing video diffusion models, resulting in 42% absolute improvement in motion dynamics and object generation accuracy, while also maintaining high fidelity and motion smoothness.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the generalization power of diffusion models, we extend the partial learning setup to a zero-shot setting, training a multi-task model on multiple synthetic datasets, each labeled for only a subset of tasks. Our method, StableMTL, repurposes image generators for latent regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task sharing. StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/astra-vision/StableMTL</p></details> |

It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

However, existing hybrids often lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity between these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing AR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial blocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and diffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through controlled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights: (1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on high-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers yields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under constrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles for future hybrid generative models.</p></details> |  |

However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention (TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment. When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead. We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance, attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models.

| **[Diffusion of Responsibility in Collective Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07935v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The term "diffusion of responsibility'' refers to situations in which multiple agents share responsibility for an outcome, obscuring individual accountability. This paper examines this frequently undesirable phenomenon in the context of collective decision-making mechanisms. The work shows that if a decision is made by two agents, then the only way to avoid diffusion of responsibility is for one agent to act as a "dictator'', making the decision unilaterally. In scenarios with more than two agents, any diffusion-free mechanism is an "elected dictatorship'' where the agents elect a single agent to make a unilateral decision. The technical results are obtained by defining a bisimulation of decision-making mechanisms, proving that bisimulation preserves responsibility-related properties, and establishing the results for a smallest bisimular mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffuse Everything: Multimodal Diffusion Models on Arbitrary State Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07903v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025.

However, adapting these models to physical applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce $\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and low-resolution data.

While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada</p></details> |

Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis and comparison of machine learning (ML) techniques for resource allocation within O-RAN, evaluating their effectiveness in optimizing network performance. We introduce a diffusion-based reinforcement learning (Diffusion-RL) algorithm designed to optimize the allocation of physical resource blocks (PRBs) and power consumption, thereby maximizing weighted throughput and minimizing the delay for user equipment (UE). The Diffusion-RL model incorporates controlled noise and perturbations to explore optimal resource distribution while meeting each service type's Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method against several benchmarks, including an exhaustive search algorithm, deep Q-networks (DQN), and the Semi-Supervised Variational Autoencoder (SS-VAE). Comprehensive metrics, such as throughput and latency, are presented for each service type. Experimental results demonstrate that the Diffusion-based RL approach outperforms existing methods in efficiency, scalability, and robustness, offering a promising solution for resource allocation in dynamic and heterogeneous O-RAN environments with significant implications for future 6G networks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

While this has been tested in high-noise settings, the behavior of diffusion models as effective denoisers when the corruption level is small remains unclear. To address this gap, we systematically investigated the behavior of diffusion models under low-noise diffusion dynamics, with implications for model robustness and interpretability. Using (i) CelebA subsets of varying sample sizes and (ii) analytic Gaussian mixture benchmarks, we reveal that models trained on disjoint data diverge near the data manifold even when their high-noise outputs converge. We quantify how training set size, data geometry, and model objective choice shape denoising trajectories and affect score accuracy, providing insights into how these models actually learn representations of data distributions. This work starts to address gaps in our understanding of generative model reliability in practical applications where small perturbations are common.</p></details> |  |
| **[R3D2: Realistic 3D Asset Insertion via Diffusion for Autonomous Driving Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07826v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential. Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast, neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2 significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see https://research.zenseact.com/publications/R3D2/.</p></details> |  |

While the consistency model offers a potential solution, its applications to decision-making often struggle with suboptimal demonstrations or rely on complex concurrent training of multiple networks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process. Our method enables single-step generation while maintaining higher performance and simpler training. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo benchmarks and long horizon planning demonstrate that our approach can achieve an 8.7% improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup over diffusion counterparts in inference time.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches in this domain utilize regression-based or generative models, but many of them are a single-stage upsampling process, which may be challenging to learn across a wide, continuous distribution of scaling factors. Progressive upsampling strategies have shown promise in mitigating this issue, yet their integration with diffusion models for flexible upscaling remains underexplored. Here, we present CasArbi, a novel self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution. CasArbi meets the varying scaling demands by breaking them down into smaller sequential factors and progressively enhancing the image resolution at each step with seamless transitions for arbitrary scales. Our novel coordinate-guided residual diffusion model allows for the learning of continuous image representations while enabling efficient diffusion sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CasArbi outperforms prior arts in both perceptual and distortion performance metrics across diverse arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing image translation methods treat infrared images as a stylistic variation, neglecting the underlying physical laws, which limits their practical application. To address these issues, we propose a Physics-Informed Diffusion (PID) model for translating RGB images to infrared images that adhere to physical laws. Our method leverages the iterative optimization of the diffusion model and incorporates strong physical constraints based on prior knowledge of infrared laws during training. This approach enhances the similarity between translated infrared images and the real infrared domain without increasing extra training parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that PID significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

This has prompted exploration of alternative approaches such as discrete diffusion. However, masked diffusion, which has emerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and effectiveness, reintroduces this inability to revise words. To overcome this, we generalize masked diffusion, deriving a new family of general interpolating discrete diffusion (GIDD) which offers greater flexibility in the design of the noising processes. Leveraging a novel diffusion ELBO, we achieve compute-matched state-of-the-art performance in diffusion language modeling. Exploiting GIDD's flexibility, we explore a hybrid approach combining masking and uniform noise, leading to improved sample quality and unlocking the ability for the model to correct its own mistakes, an area where autoregressive models notoriously have struggled.

| **[Diffusion Models-Aided Uplink Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07770v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This letter proposes a channel estimation method for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems through a novel diffusion model (DM) framework. We reformulate the channel estimation problem as a denoising process, which aligns with the reverse process of the DM. To overcome the inherent randomness in the reverse process of conventional DM approaches, we adopt a deterministic sampling strategy with a step alignment mechanism that ensures the accuracy of channel estimation while adapting to different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, to reduce the number of parameters of the U-Net, we meticulously design a lightweight network that achieves comparable performance, thereby enhancing the practicality of our proposed method. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance over a wide range of SNRs compared to baselines. For instance, the proposed method achieves performance improvements of up to 13.5 dB in normalized mean square error (NMSE) at SNR = 0 dB. Notably, the proposed lightweight network exhibits almost no performance loss compared to the original U-Net, while requiring only 6.59\% of its parameters.</p></details> | 5 pages |

However, they generally lack robustness, a limitation that remains not fully explored in current research. In this paper, we propose several methods to address this gap. First, we hypothesize that the robustness of LDMs primarily should be measured without their text encoder, because if we take and explore the whole architecture, the problems of image generator and text encoders wll be fused. Second, we introduce novel data augmentation techniques designed to reveal robustness shortcomings in LDMs when processing diverse textual prompts. We then fine-tune Stable Diffusion 3 and Stable Diffusion XL models using Dreambooth, incorporating these proposed augmentation methods across multiple tasks. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation pipeline specifically tailored to assess the robustness of LDMs fine-tuned via Dreambooth.</p></details> |  |

While recent methods leverage Score Distillation Sampling to distill 3D objects from pretrained image diffusion models, they often suffer from inadequate 3D priors, leading to insufficient multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce NOVA3D, an innovative single-image-to-3D generation framework. Our key insight lies in leveraging strong 3D priors from a pretrained video diffusion model and integrating geometric information during multi-view video fine-tuning. To facilitate information exchange between color and geometric domains, we propose the Geometry-Temporal Alignment (GTA) attention mechanism, thereby improving generalization and multi-view consistency. Moreover, we introduce the de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm, which improves texture fidelity by addressing multi-view inaccuracies and resolving discrepancies in pose alignment. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NOVA3D over existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |

Despite recent advancements in neural solvers, their limited expressiveness struggles to capture the multi-modal nature of CO landscapes. While some research has shifted towards diffusion models, these models still sample solutions indiscriminately from the entire NP-complete solution space with time-consuming denoising processes, which limit their practicality for large problem scales. We propose DISCO, an efficient DIffusion Solver for large-scale Combinatorial Optimization problems that excels in both solution quality and inference speed. DISCO's efficacy is twofold: First, it enhances solution quality by constraining the sampling space to a more meaningful domain guided by solution residues, while preserving the multi-modal properties of the output distributions. Second, it accelerates the denoising process through an analytically solvable approach, enabling solution sampling with minimal reverse-time steps and significantly reducing inference time. DISCO delivers strong performance on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems and challenging Maximal Independent Set benchmarks, with inference time up to 5.28 times faster than other diffusion alternatives. By incorporating a divide-and-conquer strategy, DISCO can well generalize to solve unseen-scale problem instances, even surpassing models specifically trained for those scales.</p></details> |  |

Existing language models and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence with local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from incoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces $\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that leverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and diffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model that combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of language models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short to long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained. The interleaved generation paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context to guide the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that SongBloom outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective metrics and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial music generation platforms.

However, these models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations, sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without needing access to the original training data. The generated images are sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks, including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the target model.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present LetsTalk, a LinEar diffusion TranSformer for Talking video synthesis. LetsTalk incorporates a deep compression autoencoder to obtain efficient latent representations, and a spatio-temporal-aware transformer with efficient linear attention to effectively fuse multimodal information and enhance spatio-temporal consistency. We systematically explore and summarize three fusion schemes, ranging from shallow to deep fusion. We thoroughly analyze their characteristics, applicability, and trade-offs, thereby bridging critical gaps in multimodal conditional guidance. Based on modality differences of image, audio, and video generation, we adopt deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait to ensure consistency, and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio to align animation with speech while preserving motion diversity. To maintain temporal consistency in long-duration video generation, we propose a memory bank mechanism that preserves inter-clip dependencies, effectively preventing degradation across extended sequences. Furthermore, we develop a noise-regularized training strategy that explicitly compensates for DDPM sampling artifacts, significantly improving the model's robustness in continuous generation scenarios.Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, while maintaining remarkable efficiency through its optimized model design with 8$\times$ fewer parameters.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

Their mass-market adoption is however still hobbled by the intense hardware resource requirements of diffusion model inference. Model quantization strategies tailored specifically towards diffusion models have been useful in easing this burden, yet have generally explored the Uniform Scalar Quantization (USQ) family of quantization methods. In contrast, Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, which operate on groups of multiple related weights as the basic unit of compression, have seen substantial success in Large Language Model (LLM) quantization. In this work, we apply codebook-based additive vector quantization to the problem of diffusion model compression. Our resulting approach achieves a new Pareto frontier for the extremely low-bit weight quantization on the standard class-conditional benchmark of LDM-4 on ImageNet at 20 inference time steps. Notably, we report sFID 1.92 points lower than the full-precision model at W4A8 and the best-reported results for FID, sFID and ISC at W2A8. We are also able to demonstrate FLOPs savings on arbitrary hardware via an efficient inference kernel, as opposed to savings resulting from small integer operations which may lack broad hardware support.</p></details> |  |

Current 4D generation techniques encounter challenges with modern rendering engines. Implicit methods have low rendering efficiency and are unfriendly to rasterization-based engines, while skeletal methods demand significant manual effort and lack cross-category generalization. Animating existing 3D assets, instead of creating 4D assets from scratch, demands a deep understanding of the input's 3D structure. To tackle these challenges, we present a 4D diffusion model that denoises sequences of latent sets, which are then decoded to produce mesh animations from point cloud trajectory sequences. These latent sets leverage a transformer-based variational autoencoder, simultaneously capturing 3D shape and motion information. By employing a spatiotemporal, transformer-based diffusion model, information is exchanged across multiple latent frames, enhancing the efficiency and generalization of the generated results. Our experimental results demonstrate that DriveAnyMesh can rapidly produce high-quality animations for complex motions and is compatible with modern rendering engines. This method holds potential for applications in both the gaming and filming industries.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[Predicting the Dynamics of Complex System via Multiscale Diffusion Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02450v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the dynamics of complex systems is crucial for various scientific and engineering applications. The accuracy of predictions depends on the model's ability to capture the intrinsic dynamics. While existing methods capture key dynamics by encoding a low-dimensional latent space, they overlook the inherent multiscale structure of complex systems, making it difficult to accurately predict complex spatiotemporal evolution. Therefore, we propose a Multiscale Diffusion Prediction Network (MDPNet) that leverages the multiscale structure of complex systems to discover the latent space of intrinsic dynamics. First, we encode multiscale features through a multiscale diffusion autoencoder to guide the diffusion model for reliable reconstruction. Then, we introduce an attention-based graph neural ordinary differential equation to model the co-evolution across different scales. Extensive evaluations on representative systems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average prediction error reduction of 53.23% compared to baselines, while also exhibiting superior robustness and generalization.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

In this paper, we introduce a novel Straight-Line Diffusion Model (SLDM) to tackle this problem, by formulating the diffusion process to follow a linear trajectory. The proposed process aligns well with the noise sensitivity characteristic of molecular structures and uniformly distributes reconstruction effort across the generative process, thus enhancing learning efficiency and efficacy. Consequently, SLDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D molecule generation benchmarks, delivering a 100-fold improvement in sampling efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While existing acceleration methods reduce workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting their applicability. We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs) while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods (<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).</p></details> |  |
| **[Gungnir: Exploiting Stylistic Features in Images for Backdoor Attacks on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20650v3)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated significant advances in the field of image generation. However, according to current research, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to control the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such as a specific visual patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well equipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger inversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input spaces and low-dimensional triggers. For example, visual triggers are easily observed by defenders, text-based or attention-based triggers are more susceptible to neural network detection. To explore more possibilities of backdoor attack in DMs, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables attackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through style triggers within input images. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the first time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image-to-image tasks by introducing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term Timesteps-Retention (STTR). Our technique generates trigger-embedded images that are perceptually indistinguishable from clean images, thus bypassing both manual inspection and automated detection neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that Gungnir can easily bypass existing defense methods. Among existing DM defense frameworks, our approach achieves a 0 backdoor detection rate (BDR). Our codes are available at https://github.com/paoche11/Gungnir.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Benefit and Limitation of Diffusion Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09622v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation. One would naturally expect this method to be an efficient replacement for autoregressive models since multiple tokens can be sampled in parallel during each diffusion step. However, its efficiency-accuracy trade-off is not yet well understood. In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of a widely used type of diffusion language model, the Masked Diffusion Model (MDM), and find that its effectiveness heavily depends on the target evaluation metric. Under mild conditions, we prove that when using perplexity as the metric, MDMs can achieve near-optimal perplexity in sampling steps regardless of sequence length, demonstrating that efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing performance. However, when using the sequence error rate--which is important for understanding the "correctness" of a sequence, such as a reasoning chain--we show that the required sampling steps must scale linearly with sequence length to obtain "correct" sequences, thereby eliminating MDM's efficiency advantage over autoregressive models. Our analysis establishes the first theoretical foundation for understanding the benefits and limitations of MDMs. All theoretical findings are supported by empirical studies.</p></details> | 32 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Diffusion-based Adversarial Purification from the Perspective of the Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01267v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion-based adversarial purification methods attempt to drown adversarial perturbations into a part of isotropic noise through the forward process, and then recover the clean images through the reverse process. Due to the lack of distribution information about adversarial perturbations in the pixel domain, it is often unavoidable to damage normal semantics. We turn to the frequency domain perspective, decomposing the image into amplitude spectrum and phase spectrum. We find that for both spectra, the damage caused by adversarial perturbations tends to increase monotonically with frequency. This means that we can extract the content and structural information of the original clean sample from the frequency components that are less damaged. Meanwhile, theoretical analysis indicates that existing purification methods indiscriminately damage all frequency components, leading to excessive damage to the image. Therefore, we propose a purification method that can eliminate adversarial perturbations while maximizing the preservation of the content and structure of the original image. Specifically, at each time step during the reverse process, for the amplitude spectrum, we replace the low-frequency components of the estimated image's amplitude spectrum with the corresponding parts of the adversarial image. For the phase spectrum, we project the phase of the estimated image into a designated range of the adversarial image's phase spectrum, focusing on the low frequencies. Empirical evidence from extensive experiments demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms most current defense methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.</p></details> |  |

Modern approaches to initial condition perturbations are primarily designed for numerical weather prediction (NWP) solvers, limiting their applicability in the rapidly growing field of machine learning for weather prediction. Consequently, stochastic models in this domain are often developed on a case-by-case basis. We demonstrate that a simple conditional diffusion model can (1) generate meaningful structured perturbations, (2) be applied iteratively, and (3) utilize a guidance term to intuitivey control the level of perturbation. This method enables the transformation of any deterministic neural forecasting system into a stochastic one. With our stochastic extended systems, we show that the model accumulates less error over long-term forecasts while producing meaningful forecast distributions. We validate our approach on the 5.625$^\circ$ ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which comprises atmospheric and surface variables over a discretized global grid, spanning from the 1960s to the present. On this dataset, our method demonstrates improved predictive performance along with reasonable spread estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 20 plots, journal paper</p></details> |

However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025 Embodied AI Workshop</p></details> |

Yet, their potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation models in vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 23 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, it is still challenging for diffusion models to efficiently generate diverse and high-quality 3D shapes. In this paper, we introduce OctFusion, which can generate 3D shapes with arbitrary resolutions in 2.5 seconds on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, and the extracted meshes are guaranteed to be continuous and manifold. The key components of OctFusion are the octree-based latent representation and the accompanying diffusion models. The representation combines the benefits of both implicit neural representations and explicit spatial octrees and is learned with an octree-based variational autoencoder. The proposed diffusion model is a unified multi-scale U-Net that enables weights and computation sharing across different octree levels and avoids the complexity of widely used cascaded diffusion schemes. We verify the effectiveness of OctFusion on the ShapeNet and Objaverse datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances on shape generation tasks. We demonstrate that OctFusion is extendable and flexible by generating high-quality color fields for textured mesh generation and high-quality 3D shapes conditioned on text prompts, sketches, or category labels.

To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p></details> |  |

Recently, these models have shifted from traditional U-Shaped CNN-Attention hybrid structures to fully transformer-based isotropic architectures. While these transformers exhibit strong scalability and performance, their reliance on complicated self-attention operation results in slow inference speeds. Contrary to these works, we rethink one of the simplest yet fastest module in deep learning, 3x3 Convolution, to construct a scaled-up purely convolutional diffusion model. We first discover that an Encoder-Decoder Hourglass design outperforms scalable isotropic architectures for Conv3x3, but still under-performing our expectation. Further improving the architecture, we introduce sparse skip connections to reduce redundancy and improve scalability. Based on the architecture, we introduce conditioning improvements including stage-specific embeddings, mid-block condition injection, and conditional gating. These improvements lead to our proposed Diffusion CNN (DiC), which serves as a swift yet competitive diffusion architecture baseline. Experiments on various scales and settings show that DiC surpasses existing diffusion transformers by considerable margins in terms of performance while keeping a good speed advantage.

The integrity of spatiotemporal data often deteriorates due to hardware malfunctions and software failures in real-world deployments. Current approaches based on machine learning and deep learning struggle to model the intricate interdependencies between spatial and temporal dimensions effectively and, more importantly, suffer from cumulative errors during the data imputation process, which propagate and amplify through iterations. To address these limitations, we propose CoFILL, a novel Conditional Diffusion Model for spatiotemporal data imputation. CoFILL builds on the inherent advantages of diffusion models to generate high-quality imputations without relying on potentially error-prone prior estimates. It incorporates an innovative dual-stream architecture that processes temporal and frequency domain features in parallel. By fusing these complementary features, CoFILL captures both rapid fluctuations and underlying patterns in the data, which enables more robust imputation. The extensive experiments reveal that CoFILL's noise prediction network successfully transforms random noise into meaningful values that align with the true data distribution.

| **[Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Manufacturing-Guiding Spectrum-to-Structure Conditional Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07083v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that manipulate electromagnetic waves, having optical properties absent in natural materials. Recently, machine learning for the inverse design of metamaterials has drawn attention. However, the highly nonlinear relationship between the metamaterial structures and optical behaviour, coupled with fabrication difficulties, poses challenges for using machine learning to design and manufacture complex metamaterials. Herein, we propose a general framework that implements customised spectrum-to-shape and size parameters to address one-to-many metamaterial inverse design problems using conditional diffusion models. Our method exhibits superior spectral prediction accuracy, generates a diverse range of patterns compared to other typical generative models, and offers valuable prior knowledge for manufacturing through the subsequent analysis of the diverse generated results, thereby facilitating the experimental fabrication of metamaterial designs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method by successfully designing and fabricating a free-form metamaterial with a tailored selective emission spectrum for thermal camouflage applications.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Existing classifier-free guidance methods use a simple heuristic to mix conditional and unconditional scores to approximately sample from conditional distributions. However, such methods do not approximate the intermediate distributions, necessitating additional `corrector' steps. In this work, we provide an efficient and principled method for sampling from a sequence of annealed, geometric-averaged, or product distributions derived from pretrained score-based models. We derive a weighted simulation scheme which we call Feynman-Kac Correctors (FKCs) based on the celebrated Feynman-Kac formula by carefully accounting for terms in the appropriate partial differential equations (PDEs). To simulate these PDEs, we propose Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) resampling algorithms that leverage inference-time scaling to improve sampling quality. We empirically demonstrate the utility of our methods by proposing amortized sampling via inference-time temperature annealing, improving multi-objective molecule generation using pretrained models, and improving classifier-free guidance for text-to-image generation.

| **[Towards Physics-informed Diffusion for Anomaly Detection in Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06999v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories) and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification. Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/arunshar/Physics-Informed-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample Complexity of Diffusion Model Training Without Empirical Risk Minimizer Access](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18344v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across vision, language, and scientific domains. Despite their empirical success, prior theoretical analyses of the sample complexity suffer from poor scaling with input data dimension or rely on unrealistic assumptions such as access to exact empirical risk minimizers. In this work, we provide a principled analysis of score estimation, establishing a sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Our approach leverages a structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, and optimization errors, enabling us to eliminate the exponential dependence on neural network parameters that arises in prior analyses. It is the first such result which achieves sample complexity bounds without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer of score function estimation loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Denoising Diffusion for ISAC Enhanced Channel Estimation in Cell-Free 6G](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06942v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell-free Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) aims to revolutionize 6th Generation (6G) networks. By combining distributed access points with ISAC capabilities, it boosts spectral efficiency, situational awareness, and communication reliability. Channel estimation is a critical step in cell-free ISAC systems to ensure reliable communication, but its performance is usually limited by challenges such as pilot contamination and noisy channel estimates. This paper presents a novel framework leveraging sensing information as a key input within a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model (CDDM). In this framework, we integrate CDDM with a Multimodal Transformer (MMT) to enhance channel estimation in ISAC-enabled cell-free systems. The MMT encoder effectively captures inter-modal relationships between sensing and location data, enabling the CDDM to iteratively denoise and refine channel estimates. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance gains. As compared with Least Squares (LS) and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) estimators, the proposed model achieves normalized mean squared error (NMSE) improvements of 8 dB and 9 dB, respectively. Moreover, we achieve a 27.8% NMSE improvement compared to the traditional denoising diffusion model (TDDM), which does not incorporate sensing channel information. Additionally, the model exhibits higher robustness against pilot contamination and maintains high accuracy under challenging conditions, such as low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). According to the simulation results, the model performs well for users near sensing targets by leveraging the correlation between sensing and communication channels.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE PIMRC conference, 6 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[RestoreGrad: Signal Restoration Using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Models with Jointly Learned Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13574v3)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can be utilized to recover a clean signal from its degraded observation(s) by conditioning the model on the degraded signal. The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information when shaping the prior, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, taking advantage of the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025 - Camera Ready Version</p></details> |
| **[Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Controlling Unknown Linear Diffusion Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09977v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear diffusion processes serve as canonical continuous-time models for dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. These systems evolve according to drift matrices that specify the instantaneous rates of change in the expected system state, while also experiencing continuous random disturbances modeled by Brownian noise. For instance, in medical applications such as artificial pancreas systems, the drift matrices represent the internal dynamics of glucose concentrations. Classical results in stochastic control provide optimal policies under perfect knowledge of the drift matrices. However, practical decision-making scenarios typically feature uncertainty about the drift; in medical contexts, such parameters are patient-specific and unknown, requiring adaptive policies for efficiently learning the drift matrices while ensuring system stability and optimal performance. We study the Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm for decision-making in linear diffusion processes with unknown drift matrices. For this algorithm that designs control policies as if samples from a posterior belief about the parameters fully coincide with the unknown truth, we establish efficiency. That is, Thompson sampling learns optimal control actions fast, incurring only a square-root of time regret, and also learns to stabilize the system in a short time period. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for TS in a diffusion process control problem. Moreover, our empirical simulations in three settings that involve blood-glucose and flight control demonstrate that TS significantly improves regret, compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, suggesting it explores in a more guarded fashion. Our theoretical analysis includes characterization of a certain optimality manifold that relates the geometry of the drift matrices to the optimal control of the diffusion process, among others.</p></details> |  |

One can use the Boltzmann distribution to formulate optimization as solving a Schr\"odinger bridge sampling problem, then apply Girsanov's theorem with a simple (single-point) prior to frame it in stochastic control terms, and compute the solution's integral terms via a neural approximation (a Fourier MLP). We provide theoretical bounds for this optimiser, results on toy optimisation tasks, and a summary of the stochastic theory motivating the model. Ultimately, we found the optimiser to display promising per-step performance at optimisation tasks between 2 and 1,247 dimensions, but struggle to explore higher-dimensional spaces when faced with a 15.9k parameter model, indicating a need for work on adaptation in such environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages.

| **[Training-Free Identity Preservation in Stylized Image Generation Using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06802v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, existing style transfer techniques often struggle to maintain identity while achieving high-quality stylization. This limitation is particularly acute for images where faces are small or exhibit significant camera-to-face distances, frequently leading to inadequate identity preservation. To address this, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized image synthesis using diffusion models. Key contributions include: (1) the "Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, significantly enhancing identity retention, especially in complex scenes; and (2) a training-free content consistency loss that enhances the preservation of fine-grained content details by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially surpasses the baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust identity integrity, particularly under conditions of small facial regions or significant camera-to-face distances, all without necessitating model retraining or fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Forgery Attacks on Semantic Watermarks for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03283v3)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating watermarking into the generation process of latent diffusion models (LDMs) simplifies detection and attribution of generated content. Semantic watermarks, such as Tree-Rings and Gaussian Shading, represent a novel class of watermarking techniques that are easy to implement and highly robust against various perturbations. However, our work demonstrates a fundamental security vulnerability of semantic watermarks. We show that attackers can leverage unrelated models, even with different latent spaces and architectures (UNet vs DiT), to perform powerful and realistic forgery attacks. Specifically, we design two watermark forgery attacks. The first imprints a targeted watermark into real images by manipulating the latent representation of an arbitrary image in an unrelated LDM to get closer to the latent representation of a watermarked image. We also show that this technique can be used for watermark removal. The second attack generates new images with the target watermark by inverting a watermarked image and re-generating it with an arbitrary prompt. Both attacks just need a single reference image with the target watermark. Overall, our findings question the applicability of semantic watermarks by revealing that attackers can easily forge or remove these watermarks under realistic conditions.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Towards Black-Box Membership Inference Attack for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20771v4)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.</p></details> |  |

These latent object representations enable a variety of downstream tasks. Yet, object-centric learning struggles on real-world datasets, which contain multiple objects of complex textures and shapes in natural everyday scenes. To address this, we introduce Guided Latent Slot Diffusion (GLASS), a novel slot-attention model that learns in the space of generated images and uses semantic and instance guidance modules to learn better slot embeddings for various downstream tasks. Our experiments show that GLASS surpasses state-of-the-art slot-attention methods by a wide margin on tasks such as (zero-shot) object discovery and conditional image generation for real-world scenes. Moreover, GLASS enables the first application of slot attention to the compositional generation of complex, realistic scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

While machine learning-based surrogate models can offer significant cost reductions, most focus on a single task, such as forward prediction, and typically lack uncertainty quantification -- an essential component in many applications. To overcome these limitations, we propose Arbitrarily-Conditioned Multi-Functional Diffusion (ACM-FD), a versatile probabilistic surrogate model for multi-physics emulation. ACM-FD can perform a wide range of tasks within a single framework, including forward prediction, various inverse problems, and simulating data for entire systems or subsets of quantities conditioned on others. Specifically, we extend the standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) for multi-functional generation by modeling noise as Gaussian processes (GP). We propose a random-mask based, zero-regularized denoising loss to achieve flexible and robust conditional generation. We induce a Kronecker product structure in the GP covariance matrix, substantially reducing the computational cost and enabling efficient training and sampling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACM-FD across several fundamental multi-physics systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Diffusability of Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14831v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for generating high-quality images and videos, utilizing compressed latent representations to reduce the computational burden of the diffusion process. While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K $256^2$ and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 $17 \times 256^2$.

Trained diffusion models can also be very effective image priors for solving inverse problems. Most of the existing diffusion-based methods integrate data consistency steps by approximating the likelihood function within the diffusion reverse sampling process. In this paper, we show that the existing approximations are either insufficient or computationally inefficient. To address these issues, we propose a unified likelihood approximation method that incorporates a covariance correction term to enhance the performance and avoids propagating gradients through the diffusion model. The correction term, when integrated into the reverse diffusion sampling process, achieves better convergence towards the true data posterior for selected distributions and improves performance on real-world natural image datasets. Furthermore, we present an efficient way to factorize and invert the covariance matrix of the likelihood function for several inverse problems. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over several existing approaches. Code available at https://github.com/CSIPlab/CoDPS.</p></details> |  |

This paper examines Chain of Diffusion, where a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model is finetuned on its own generated images. We demonstrate that severe image quality degradation was universal and identify CFG scale as the key factor impacting this model collapse. Drawing on an analogy between the Chain of Diffusion and biological evolution, we then introduce a novel theoretical analysis based on quantitative trait modeling from statistical genetics. Our theoretical analysis aligns with empirical observations of the generated images in the Chain of Diffusion. Finally, we propose Reusable Diffusion Finetuning (ReDiFine), a simple yet effective strategy inspired by genetic mutations. It operates robustly across various scenarios without requiring any hyperparameter tuning, making it a plug-and-play solution for reusable image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>versi...</summary><p>version 3, additional 34 pages</p></details> |

By reformulating the discrete ADEs as directional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) along temporal or spatial dimensions, we derive analytical solutions that lead to novel update formulas. In essence, the information of discrete ADEs is compressed into these directional ODEs, which we refer to as representative ODEs. The analytical update formulas derived from the representative ODEs significantly enhance stability, computational efficiency, and spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, we extend the framework to systems with uncertain parameters and coefficients, showcasing its versatility in addressing complex ADEs encountered in modeling and simulation across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines.</p></details> |  |

While there is increasing effort to incorporate physics-based constraints into generative models, existing techniques are either limited in their applicability to latent diffusion frameworks or lack the capability to strictly enforce domain-specific constraints. To address this limitation this paper proposes a novel integration of stable diffusion models with constrained optimization frameworks, enabling the generation of outputs satisfying stringent physical and functional requirements. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through material design experiments requiring adherence to precise morphometric properties, challenging inverse design tasks involving the generation of materials inducing specific stress-strain responses, and copyright-constrained content generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Lately, the use of synthetic data to complement or replace genuine data for the training of face recognition models has been proposed. While promising results have been obtained, it still remains unclear if generative models can yield diverse enough data for such tasks. In this work, we introduce a new method, inspired by the physical motion of soft particles subjected to stochastic Brownian forces, allowing us to sample identities distributions in a latent space under various constraints. We introduce three complementary algorithms, called Langevin, Dispersion, and DisCo, aimed at generating large synthetic face datasets. With this in hands, we generate several face datasets and benchmark them by training face recognition models, showing that data generated with our method exceeds the performance of previously GAN-based datasets and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art diffusion-based synthetic datasets.

| **[Exploring Diffusion Transformer Designs via Grafting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05340v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators (e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width). However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants. Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model (PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77) than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging from operator replacement to architecture restructuring.

Across unconditional models trained on diverse datasets, text-conditioned latent-diffusion models, and diffusion-posterior samplers, we find that pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields strongly negatively correlated samples. To explain this phenomenon, we combine experiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up to a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it. Leveraging this negative correlation, we enable two applications: (1) enhancing image diversity in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss, and (2) sharpening uncertainty quantification (e.g., up to 90% narrower confidence intervals) when estimating downstream statistics. Building on these gains, we extend the two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator, which further improves estimation accuracy. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic, and adds no runtime overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 20 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient (MAC), a plug-in module for flow and diffusion models that extends conventional unidimensional coefficients to multidimensional ones and enables inference trajectory-wise adaptation. MAC is trained via simulation-based feedback through adversarial refinement. Empirical results across diverse frameworks and datasets demonstrate that MAC enhances generative quality with high training efficiency. Consequently, our work offers a new perspective on inference trajectory optimality, encouraging future research to move beyond vector field design and to leverage training-efficient, simulation-based optimization.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Paper |

We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need. Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To address these challenges, we introduce an efficient Fine-Grained Guidance (FGG) approach within diffusion models. FGG guides the diffusion models to generate music that aligns more closely with the control and intent of expert composers, which is critical to improve the accuracy, listenability, and quality of generated music. This approach empowers diffusion models to excel in advanced applications such as improvisation, and interactive music creation. We derive theoretical characterizations for both the challenges in symbolic music generation and the effects of the FGG approach. We provide numerical experiments and subjective evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

| **[Diffusion-Based Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Simulating Nonlinear Solid Mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06045v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network (ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities. ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.</p></details> |  |

This can often complicate the reverse process' task in learning generative trajectories, and results in costly inference for diffusion models. To address these limitations, we introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), a novel framework that enhances diffusion models by supporting a broader range of forward processes beyond the standard Gaussian. We also propose a novel parameterization technique for learning the forward process. Our framework provides an end-to-end, simulation-free optimization objective, effectively minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood. Experimental results demonstrate NFDM's strong performance, evidenced by state-of-the-art likelihood estimation. Furthermore, we investigate NFDM's capacity for learning generative dynamics with specific characteristics, such as deterministic straight lines trajectories, and demonstrate how the framework may be adopted for learning bridges between two distributions. The results underscores NFDM's versatility and its potential for a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  |

Even though progress has been made in decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and multifaceted semantic information. To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1) The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior, capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, 3 tabs</p></details> |
| **[Sample-Specific Noise Injection For Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06027v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI). Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then, based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels to different samples in DBP methods.

However, most existing methods focus on generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Recent studies demonstrate the capability to forge watermarks from a target image onto cover images via adversarial optimization without knowledge of the target generative model and watermark schemes. In this paper, we uncover a greater risk of an optimization-free and universal watermark forgery that harnesses existing regenerative diffusion models. Our proposed forgery attack, PnP (Plug-and-Plant), seamlessly extracts and integrates the target watermark via regenerating the image, without needing any additional optimization routine. It allows for universal watermark forgery that works independently of the target image's origin or the watermarking model used. We explore the watermarked latent extracted from the target image and visual-textual context of cover images as priors to guide sampling of the regenerative process. Extensive evaluation on 24 scenarios of model-data-watermark combinations demonstrates that PnP can successfully forge the watermark (up to 100% detectability and user attribution), and maintain the best visual perception. By bypassing model retraining and enabling adaptability to any image, our approach significantly broadens the scope of forgery attacks, presenting a greater challenge to the security of current watermarking techniques for diffusion models and the authority of watermarking schemes in synthetic data generation and governance.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges handling distribution shifts due to the lack of online interaction during training. To this end, we propose a novel method named State Reconstruction for Diffusion Policies (SRDP) that incorporates state reconstruction feature learning in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our method promotes learning of generalizable state representation to alleviate the distribution shift caused by OOD states. To illustrate the OOD generalization and faster convergence of SRDP, we design a novel 2D Multimodal Contextual Bandit environment and realize it on a 6-DoF real-world UR10 robot, as well as in simulation, and compare its performance with prior algorithms. In particular, we show the importance of the proposed state reconstruction via ablation studies. In addition, we assess the performance of our model on standard continuous control benchmarks (D4RL), namely the navigation of an 8-DoF ant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achieving state-of-the-art results. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can achieve 167% improvement over the competing baseline on a sparse continuous control navigation task where various regions of the state space are removed from the offline RL dataset, including the region encapsulating the goal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE RA-L with IROS presentation option (2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems), 8 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[FADE: Frequency-Aware Diffusion Model Factorization for Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05934v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts. However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role. Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

| **[State-Covering Trajectory Stitching for Diffusion Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00895v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infinite-Dimensional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10130v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have had a profound impact on many application areas, including those where data are intrinsically infinite-dimensional, such as images or time series. The standard approach is first to discretize and then to apply diffusion models to the discretized data. While such approaches are practically appealing, the performance of the resulting algorithms typically deteriorates as discretization parameters are refined. In this paper, we instead directly formulate diffusion-based generative models in infinite dimensions and apply them to the generative modelling of functions. We prove that our formulations are well posed in the infinite-dimensional setting and provide dimension-independent distance bounds from the sample to the target measure. Using our theory, we also develop guidelines for the design of infinite-dimensional diffusion models. For image distributions, these guidelines are in line with current canonical choices. For other distributions, however, we can improve upon these canonical choices. We demonstrate these results both theoretically and empirically, by applying the algorithms to data distributions on manifolds and to distributions arising in Bayesian inverse problems or simulation-based inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditioning Diffusions Using Malliavin Calculus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03461v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In generative modelling and stochastic optimal control, a central computational task is to modify a reference diffusion process to maximise a given terminal-time reward. Most existing methods require this reward to be differentiable, using gradients to steer the diffusion towards favourable outcomes. However, in many practical settings, like diffusion bridges, the reward is singular, taking an infinite value if the target is hit and zero otherwise. We introduce a novel framework, based on Malliavin calculus and centred around a generalisation of the Tweedie score formula to nonlinear stochastic differential equations, that enables the development of methods robust to such singularities. This allows our approach to handle a broad range of applications, like diffusion bridges, or adding conditional controls to an already trained diffusion model. We demonstrate that our approach offers stable and reliable training, outperforming existing techniques. As a byproduct, we also introduce a novel score matching objective. Our loss functions are formulated such that they could readily be extended to manifold-valued and infinite dimensional diffusions.</p></details> |  |

However, the corresponding diffusion pattern on a city scale is seldom mentioned at present stage, therefore, we chose the Cheng-Yu urban agglomeration, which is the largest city cluster in Southwest China, as our study area during the COVID-19 period, and attempted to investigate the process of PM2.5 diffusion using a complex network method. The results displayed that there was an evident external spillover effect of PM2.5 across all regions, and the PM2.5 spillovers were concentrated in several cities in the Cheng-Yu urban agglomeration during the lockdown period, whereas they are more dispersed during the recovery period. The overall decline in the impact of PM2.5 pollution source areas on receptor areas from a normal year to the pandemic year, and the intensity of PM2.5 spillover decreases gradually as the distance from the center increases. The implementation of the lockdown measures had an impact on both the input and output patterns of PM2.5 pollution in the region, the input pattern of PM2.5 pollution exhibited higher vulnerability, while the output pattern showed higher resilience. Additionally, the spillover relationship of PM2.5 pollution varies between different blocks, with relatively simple spillover relationships observed during the lockdown period and more complex dynamics during the recovery period. These findings have highlighted the importance of joint controls in combating regional air pollution.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was retracted due to the author's follow-up research and found that the original conclusion was wrong</p></details> |

However, their substantial computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges. Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions, which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking, listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX 4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45 FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140 ms and 215 ms, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing image semantic communication schemes are primarily focused on optimizing pixel-level metrics, while neglecting the crucial aspect of region of interest (ROI) preservation. To address this issue, we propose an ROI-aware latent representation-oriented image semantic communication (LRISC) system. In particular, we first map the source image to latent features in a high-dimensional semantic space, these latent features are then fused with ROI mask through a feature-weighting mechanism. Subsequently, these features are encoded using a joint source and channel coding (JSCC) scheme with adaptive rate for efficient transmission over a wireless channel. At the receiver, a conditional diffusion model is developed by using the received latent features as conditional guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, progressively reconstructing high-fidelity images while preserving semantic consistency. Moreover, we introduce a channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptation mechanism, allowing one model to work across various channel states. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods, in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) and robustness against channel noise, with an average LPIPS reduction of 43.3% compared to DeepJSCC, while guaranteeing the semantic consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, update title</p></details> |

While the Gaussian policy performs well on simpler tasks, its exploration capacity and potential performance in complex multi-goal RL environments are limited by its inherent unimodality. In this paper, we employ the diffusion model, a powerful generative model capable of capturing complex multimodal distributions, as the policy representation to fulfill the MaxEnt RL objective, developing a method named MaxEnt RL with Diffusion Policy (MaxEntDP). Our method enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Experimental results on Mujoco benchmarks show that MaxEntDP outperforms the Gaussian policy and other generative models within the MaxEnt RL framework, and performs comparably to other state-of-the-art diffusion-based online RL algorithms.

However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |

Some works attempted to solve MRI reconstruction with diffusion models, but these methods operate directly in pixel space, leading to higher computational costs for optimization and inference. Latent diffusion models, pre-trained on natural images with rich visual priors, are expected to solve the high computational cost problem in MRI reconstruction by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space. However, direct application to MRI reconstruction faces three key challenges: (1) absence of explicit control mechanisms for medical fidelity, (2) domain gap between natural images and MR physics, and (3) undefined data consistency in latent space. To address these challenges, a novel Latent Diffusion Prior-based undersampled MRI reconstruction (LDPM) method is proposed. Our LDPM framework addresses these challenges by: (1) a sketch-guided pipeline with a two-step reconstruction strategy, which balances perceptual quality and anatomical fidelity, (2) an MRI-optimized VAE (MR-VAE), which achieves an improvement of approximately 3.92 dB in PSNR for undersampled MRI reconstruction compared to that with SD-VAE \cite{sd}, and (3) Dual-Stage Sampler, a modified version of spaced DDPM sampler, which enforces high-fidelity reconstruction in the latent space. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset\cite{fastmri} demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method and its robustness across various scenarios. The effectiveness of each module is also verified through ablation experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as oral presentation at EMBC 2025</p></details> |

A rigorous theoretical foundation is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning. Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines, particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission in future 6G systems.</p></details> |  |

Although substantial resources are expended in collecting and labeling datasets, a critical aspect is often neglected: \textit{preferences vary across individuals and should be represented with more granularity.} To address this, we propose SmPO-Diffusion, a novel method for modeling preference distributions to improve the DPO objective, along with a numerical upper bound estimation for the diffusion optimization objective. First, we introduce a smoothed preference distribution to replace the original binary distribution. We employ a reward model to simulate human preferences and apply preference likelihood averaging to improve the DPO loss, such that the loss function approaches zero when preferences are similar. Furthermore, we utilize an inversion technique to simulate the trajectory preference distribution of the diffusion model, enabling more accurate alignment with the optimization objective. Our approach effectively mitigates issues of excessive optimization and objective misalignment present in existing methods through straightforward modifications. Our SmPO-Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in preference evaluation, outperforming baselines across metrics with lower training costs.

Although both quantization and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to the lack of joint optimization. We introduce FPSAttention, a novel training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation, with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fps.ziplab.co</p></details> |

Prior approaches have employed location prediction paradigms to achieve long-term goal reasoning, yet these methods often struggle to effectively integrate contextual relation reasoning. Alternatively, map completion-based paradigms predict long-term goals by generating semantic maps of unexplored areas. However, existing methods in this category fail to fully leverage known environmental information, resulting in suboptimal map quality that requires further improvement. In this work, we propose a novel approach to enhancing the ObjectNav task, by training a diffusion model to learn the statistical distribution patterns of objects in semantic maps, and using the map of the explored regions during navigation as the condition to generate the map of the unknown regions, thereby realizing the long-term goal reasoning of the target object, i.e., diffusion as reasoning (DAR). Meanwhile, we propose the Room Guidance method, which leverages commonsense knowledge derived from large language models (LLMs) to guide the diffusion model in generating room-aware object distributions. Based on the generated map in the unknown region, the agent sets the predicted location of the target as the goal and moves towards it. Experiments on Gibson and MP3D show the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
