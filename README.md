| **[Multi-sentence Video Grounding for Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13219v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has witnessed great success recently, but their application in generating long videos still remains challenging due to the difficulty in maintaining the temporal consistency of generated videos and the high memory cost during generation. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose a brave and new idea of Multi-sentence Video Grounding for Long Video Generation, connecting the massive video moment retrieval to the video generation task for the first time, providing a new paradigm for long video generation. The method of our work can be summarized as three steps: (i) We design sequential scene text prompts as the queries for video grounding, utilizing the massive video moment retrieval to search for video moment segments that meet the text requirements in the video database. (ii) Based on the source frames of retrieved video moment segments, we adopt video editing methods to create new video content while preserving the temporal consistency of the retrieved video. Since the editing can be conducted segment by segment, and even frame by frame, it largely reduces the memory cost. (iii) We also attempt video morphing and personalized generation methods to improve the subject consistency of long video generation, providing ablation experimental results for the subtasks of long video generation. Our approach seamlessly extends the development in image/video editing, video morphing and personalized generation, and video grounding to the long video generation, offering effective solutions for generating long videos at low memory cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reangle-A-Video: 4D Video Generation as Video-to-Video Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09151v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized multi-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data.

| **[Generative Video Propagation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19761v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video generation models have the inherent ability to realistically model natural scenes. In this paper, we demonstrate that through a careful design of a generative video propagation framework, various video tasks can be addressed in a unified way by leveraging the generative power of such models. Specifically, our framework, GenProp, encodes the original video with a selective content encoder and propagates the changes made to the first frame using an image-to-video generation model. We propose a data generation scheme to cover multiple video tasks based on instance-level video segmentation datasets. Our model is trained by incorporating a mask prediction decoder head and optimizing a region-aware loss to aid the encoder to preserve the original content while the generation model propagates the modified region. This novel design opens up new possibilities: In editing scenarios, GenProp allows substantial changes to an object's shape; for insertion, the inserted objects can exhibit independent motion; for removal, GenProp effectively removes effects like shadows and reflections from the whole video; for tracking, GenProp is capable of tracking objects and their associated effects together. Experiment results demonstrate the leading performance of our model in various video tasks, and we further provide in-depth analyses of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 11 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Diverse Video Generation from a Single Video](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05725v1)** | 2022-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GANs are able to perform generation and manipulation tasks, trained on a single video. However, these single video GANs require unreasonable amount of time to train on a single video, rendering them almost impractical. In this paper we question the necessity of a GAN for generation from a single video, and introduce a non-parametric baseline for a variety of generation and manipulation tasks. We revive classical space-time patches-nearest-neighbors approaches and adapt them to a scalable unconditional generative model, without any learning. This simple baseline surprisingly outperforms single-video GANs in visual quality and realism (confirmed by quantitative and qualitative evaluations), and is disproportionately faster (runtime reduced from several days to seconds). Our approach is easily scaled to Full-HD videos. We also use the same framework to demonstrate video analogies and spatio-temporal retargeting. These observations show that classical approaches significantly outperform heavy deep learning machinery for these tasks. This sets a new baseline for single-video generation and manipulation tasks, and no less important -- makes diverse generation from a single video practically possible for the first time.</p></details> | <details><summary>AI fo...</summary><p>AI for Content Creation Workshop @ CVPR 2022</p></details> |
| **[Enhance-A-Video: Better Generated Video for Free](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07508v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DiT-based video generation has achieved remarkable results, but research into enhancing existing models remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce a training-free approach to enhance the coherence and quality of DiT-based generated videos, named Enhance-A-Video. The core idea is enhancing the cross-frame correlations based on non-diagonal temporal attention distributions. Thanks to its simple design, our approach can be easily applied to most DiT-based video generation frameworks without any retraining or fine-tuning. Across various DiT-based video generation models, our approach demonstrates promising improvements in both temporal consistency and visual quality. We hope this research can inspire future explorations in video generation enhancement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Video Generation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16869v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular, the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex, multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models, analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

| **[Make-A-Video: Text-to-Video Generation without Text-Video Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14792v1)** | 2022-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Make-A-Video -- an approach for directly translating the tremendous recent progress in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation to Text-to-Video (T2V). Our intuition is simple: learn what the world looks like and how it is described from paired text-image data, and learn how the world moves from unsupervised video footage. Make-A-Video has three advantages: (1) it accelerates training of the T2V model (it does not need to learn visual and multimodal representations from scratch), (2) it does not require paired text-video data, and (3) the generated videos inherit the vastness (diversity in aesthetic, fantastical depictions, etc.) of today's image generation models. We design a simple yet effective way to build on T2I models with novel and effective spatial-temporal modules. First, we decompose the full temporal U-Net and attention tensors and approximate them in space and time. Second, we design a spatial temporal pipeline to generate high resolution and frame rate videos with a video decoder, interpolation model and two super resolution models that can enable various applications besides T2V. In all aspects, spatial and temporal resolution, faithfulness to text, and quality, Make-A-Video sets the new state-of-the-art in text-to-video generation, as determined by both qualitative and quantitative measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-T1: Test-Time Scaling for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18942v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the scale capability of increasing training data, model size, and computational cost, video generation has achieved impressive results in digital creation, enabling users to express creativity across various domains. Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more inference-time computation. Instead of scaling up video foundation models through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target video distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching process. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs, we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute consistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.

| **[Imagen Video: High Definition Video Generation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02303v1)** | 2022-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Imagen Video, a text-conditional video generation system based on a cascade of video diffusion models. Given a text prompt, Imagen Video generates high definition videos using a base video generation model and a sequence of interleaved spatial and temporal video super-resolution models. We describe how we scale up the system as a high definition text-to-video model including design decisions such as the choice of fully-convolutional temporal and spatial super-resolution models at certain resolutions, and the choice of the v-parameterization of diffusion models. In addition, we confirm and transfer findings from previous work on diffusion-based image generation to the video generation setting. Finally, we apply progressive distillation to our video models with classifier-free guidance for fast, high quality sampling. We find Imagen Video not only capable of generating videos of high fidelity, but also having a high degree of controllability and world knowledge, including the ability to generate diverse videos and text animations in various artistic styles and with 3D object understanding.

| **[MJ-VIDEO: Fine-Grained Benchmarking and Rewarding Video Preferences in Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01719v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have significantly improved the ability to synthesize videos from text instructions. However, existing models still struggle with key challenges such as instruction misalignment, content hallucination, safety concerns, and bias. Addressing these limitations, we introduce MJ-BENCH-VIDEO, a large-scale video preference benchmark designed to evaluate video generation across five critical aspects: Alignment, Safety, Fineness, Coherence & Consistency, and Bias & Fairness. This benchmark incorporates 28 fine-grained criteria to provide a comprehensive evaluation of video preference. Building upon this dataset, we propose MJ-VIDEO, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based video reward model designed to deliver fine-grained reward. MJ-VIDEO can dynamically select relevant experts to accurately judge the preference based on the input text-video pair. This architecture enables more precise and adaptable preference judgments. Through extensive benchmarking on MJ-BENCH-VIDEO, we analyze the limitations of existing video reward models and demonstrate the superior performance of MJ-VIDEO in video preference assessment, achieving 17.58% and 15.87% improvements in overall and fine-grained preference judgments, respectively. Additionally, introducing MJ-VIDEO for preference tuning in video generation enhances the alignment performance.

| **[Autoencoding Video Latents for Adversarial Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06888v1)** | 2022-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the three dimensional complexity of a video signal, training a robust and diverse GAN based video generative model is onerous due to large stochasticity involved in data space. Learning disentangled representations of the data help to improve robustness and provide control in the sampling process. For video generation, there is a recent progress in this area by considering motion and appearance as orthogonal information and designing architectures that efficiently disentangle them. These approaches rely on handcrafting architectures that impose structural priors on the generator to decompose appearance and motion codes in the latent space. Inspired from the recent advancements in the autoencoder based image generation, we present AVLAE (Adversarial Video Latent AutoEncoder) which is a two stream latent autoencoder where the video distribution is learned by adversarial training. In particular, we propose to autoencode the motion and appearance latent vectors of the video generator in the adversarial setting. We demonstrate that our approach learns to disentangle motion and appearance codes even without the explicit structural composition in the generator. Several experiments with qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Cascaded Video Generation for Videos In-the-Wild](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00735v1)** | 2022-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos can be created by first outlining a global view of the scene and then adding local details. Inspired by this idea we propose a cascaded model for video generation which follows a coarse to fine approach. First our model generates a low resolution video, establishing the global scene structure, which is then refined by subsequent cascade levels operating at larger resolutions. We train each cascade level sequentially on partial views of the videos, which reduces the computational complexity of our model and makes it scalable to high-resolution videos with many frames. We empirically validate our approach on UCF101 and Kinetics-600, for which our model is competitive with the state-of-the-art. We further demonstrate the scaling capabilities of our model and train a three-level model on the BDD100K dataset which generates 256x256 pixels videos with 48 frames.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 26th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2022). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2106.02719</p></details> |
| **[Video-Bench: Human-Aligned Video Generation Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04907v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models produce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human expectations. Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation. Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions. Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR'25 |
| **[Sounding Video Generator: A Unified Framework for Text-guided Sounding Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16541v1)** | 2023-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a combination of visual and audio signals, video is inherently multi-modal. However, existing video generation methods are primarily intended for the synthesis of visual frames, whereas audio signals in realistic videos are disregarded. In this work, we concentrate on a rarely investigated problem of text guided sounding video generation and propose the Sounding Video Generator (SVG), a unified framework for generating realistic videos along with audio signals. Specifically, we present the SVG-VQGAN to transform visual frames and audio melspectrograms into discrete tokens. SVG-VQGAN applies a novel hybrid contrastive learning method to model inter-modal and intra-modal consistency and improve the quantized representations. A cross-modal attention module is employed to extract associated features of visual frames and audio signals for contrastive learning. Then, a Transformer-based decoder is used to model associations between texts, visual frames, and audio signals at token level for auto-regressive sounding video generation. AudioSetCap, a human annotated text-video-audio paired dataset, is produced for training SVG. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method when compared with existing textto-video generation methods as well as audio generation methods on Kinetics and VAS datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[VC4VG: Optimizing Video Captions for Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24134v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation highlight the critical role of high-quality video-text pairs in training models capable of producing coherent and instruction-aligned videos. However, strategies for optimizing video captions specifically for T2V training remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce VC4VG (Video Captioning for Video Generation), a comprehensive caption optimization framework tailored to the needs of T2V models. We begin by analyzing caption content from a T2V perspective, decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with T2V-specific requirements. Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. We release all benchmark tools and code at https://github.com/alimama-creative/VC4VG to support further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Playable Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12195v1)** | 2021-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the unsupervised learning problem of playable video generation (PVG). In PVG, we aim at allowing a user to control the generated video by selecting a discrete action at every time step as when playing a video game. The difficulty of the task lies both in learning semantically consistent actions and in generating realistic videos conditioned on the user input. We propose a novel framework for PVG that is trained in a self-supervised manner on a large dataset of unlabelled videos. We employ an encoder-decoder architecture where the predicted action labels act as bottleneck. The network is constrained to learn a rich action space using, as main driving loss, a reconstruction loss on the generated video. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several datasets with wide environment variety. Further details, code and examples are available on our project page willi-menapace.github.io/playable-video-generation-website.</p></details> |  |
| **[General Video Game Rule Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05160v1)** | 2019-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the General Video Game Rule Generation problem, and the eponymous software framework which will be used in a new track of the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) competition. The problem is, given a game level as input, to generate the rules of a game that fits that level. This can be seen as the inverse of the General Video Game Level Generation problem. Conceptualizing these two problems as separate helps breaking the very hard problem of generating complete games into smaller, more manageable subproblems. The proposed framework builds on the GVGAI software and thus asks the rule generator for rules defined in the Video Game Description Language. We describe the API, and three different rule generators: a random, a constructive and a search-based generator. Early results indicate that the constructive generator generates playable and somewhat interesting game rules but has a limited expressive range, whereas the search-based generator generates remarkably diverse rulesets, but with an uneven quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 listings, 1 table, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[MEVG: Multi-event Video Generation with Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04086v2)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel diffusion-based video generation method, generating a video showing multiple events given multiple individual sentences from the user. Our method does not require a large-scale video dataset since our method uses a pre-trained diffusion-based text-to-video generative model without a fine-tuning process. Specifically, we propose a last frame-aware diffusion process to preserve visual coherence between consecutive videos where each video consists of different events by initializing the latent and simultaneously adjusting noise in the latent to enhance the motion dynamic in a generated video. Furthermore, we find that the iterative update of latent vectors by referring to all the preceding frames maintains the global appearance across the frames in a video clip. To handle dynamic text input for video generation, we utilize a novel prompt generator that transfers course text messages from the user into the multiple optimal prompts for the text-to-video diffusion model. Extensive experiments and user studies show that our proposed method is superior to other video-generative models in terms of temporal coherency of content and semantics.

| **[Title Generation for User Generated Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07068v2)** | 2016-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A great video title describes the most salient event compactly and captures the viewer's attention. In contrast, video captioning tends to generate sentences that describe the video as a whole. Although generating a video title automatically is a very useful task, it is much less addressed than video captioning. We address video title generation for the first time by proposing two methods that extend state-of-the-art video captioners to this new task. First, we make video captioners highlight sensitive by priming them with a highlight detector. Our framework allows for jointly training a model for title generation and video highlight localization. Second, we induce high sentence diversity in video captioners, so that the generated titles are also diverse and catchy. This means that a large number of sentences might be required to learn the sentence structure of titles. Hence, we propose a novel sentence augmentation method to train a captioner with additional sentence-only examples that come without corresponding videos. We collected a large-scale Video Titles in the Wild (VTW) dataset of 18100 automatically crawled user-generated videos and titles. On VTW, our methods consistently improve title prediction accuracy, and achieve the best performance in both automatic and human evaluation. Finally, our sentence augmentation method also outperforms the baselines on the M-VAD dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, ECCV2016</p></details> |

We improve video captioning by sharing knowledge with two related directed-generation tasks: a temporally-directed unsupervised video prediction task to learn richer context-aware video encoder representations, and a logically-directed language entailment generation task to learn better video-entailed caption decoder representations. For this, we present a many-to-many multi-task learning model that shares parameters across the encoders and decoders of the three tasks. We achieve significant improvements and the new state-of-the-art on several standard video captioning datasets using diverse automatic and human evaluations. We also show mutual multi-task improvements on the entailment generation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2017 (14 pages w/ supplementary)</p></details> |
| **[Video-Infinity: Distributed Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16260v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable results for video generation. Despite the encouraging performances, the generated videos are typically constrained to a small number of frames, resulting in clips lasting merely a few seconds. The primary challenges in producing longer videos include the substantial memory requirements and the extended processing time required on a single GPU. A straightforward solution would be to split the workload across multiple GPUs, which, however, leads to two issues: (1) ensuring all GPUs communicate effectively to share timing and context information, and (2) modifying existing video diffusion models, which are usually trained on short sequences, to create longer videos without additional training. To tackle these, in this paper we introduce Video-Infinity, a distributed inference pipeline that enables parallel processing across multiple GPUs for long-form video generation. Specifically, we propose two coherent mechanisms: Clip parallelism and Dual-scope attention. Clip parallelism optimizes the gathering and sharing of context information across GPUs which minimizes communication overhead, while Dual-scope attention modulates the temporal self-attention to balance local and global contexts efficiently across the devices. Together, the two mechanisms join forces to distribute the workload and enable the fast generation of long videos. Under an 8 x Nvidia 6000 Ada GPU (48G) setup, our method generates videos up to 2,300 frames in approximately 5 minutes, enabling long video generation at a speed 100 times faster than the prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounded Video Caption Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07584v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new task, dataset and model for grounded video caption generation. This task unifies captioning and object grounding in video, where the objects in the caption are grounded in the video via temporally consistent bounding boxes. We introduce the following contributions. First, we present a task definition and a manually annotated test dataset for this task, referred to as GROunded Video Caption Generation (GROC). Second, we introduce a large-scale automatic annotation method leveraging an existing model for grounded still image captioning together with an LLM for summarising frame-level captions into temporally consistent captions in video. Furthermore, we prompt the LLM to track by language -- classifying noun phrases from the frame-level captions into noun phrases of the video-level generated caption. We apply this approach to videos from the HowTo100M dataset, which results in a new large-scale training dataset, called HowToGround, with automatically annotated captions and spatio-temporally consistent bounding boxes with coherent natural language labels. Third, we introduce a new grounded video caption generation model, called VideoGround, and train the model on the new automatically annotated HowToGround dataset. Finally, results of our VideoGround model set the state of the art for the new task of grounded video caption generation. We perform extensive ablations and demonstrate the importance of key technical contributions of our model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Frame: Generating 360° Panoramic Videos from Perspective Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07940v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>360° videos have emerged as a promising medium to represent our dynamic visual world. Compared to the "tunnel vision" of standard cameras, their borderless field of view offers a more complete perspective of our surroundings. While existing video models excel at producing standard videos, their ability to generate full panoramic videos remains elusive. In this paper, we investigate the task of video-to-360° generation: given a perspective video as input, our goal is to generate a full panoramic video that is consistent with the original video. Unlike conventional video generation tasks, the output's field of view is significantly larger, and the model is required to have a deep understanding of both the spatial layout of the scene and the dynamics of objects to maintain spatio-temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we first leverage the abundant 360° videos available online and develop a high-quality data filtering pipeline to curate pairwise training data. We then carefully design a series of geometry- and motion-aware operations to facilitate the learning process and improve the quality of 360° video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate realistic and coherent 360° videos from in-the-wild perspective video. In addition, we showcase its potential applications, including video stabilization, camera viewpoint control, and interactive visual question answering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://red-fairy.github.io/argus/</p></details> |
| **[VEnhancer: Generative Space-Time Enhancement for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07667v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present VEnhancer, a generative space-time enhancement framework that improves the existing text-to-video results by adding more details in spatial domain and synthetic detailed motion in temporal domain. Given a generated low-quality video, our approach can increase its spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously with arbitrary up-sampling space and time scales through a unified video diffusion model. Furthermore, VEnhancer effectively removes generated spatial artifacts and temporal flickering of generated videos. To achieve this, basing on a pretrained video diffusion model, we train a video ControlNet and inject it to the diffusion model as a condition on low frame-rate and low-resolution videos. To effectively train this video ControlNet, we design space-time data augmentation as well as video-aware conditioning. Benefiting from the above designs, VEnhancer yields to be stable during training and shares an elegant end-to-end training manner. Extensive experiments show that VEnhancer surpasses existing state-of-the-art video super-resolution and space-time super-resolution methods in enhancing AI-generated videos. Moreover, with VEnhancer, exisiting open-source state-of-the-art text-to-video method, VideoCrafter-2, reaches the top one in video generation benchmark -- VBench.</p></details> | technical report |

Existing methods either introduce artifacts by enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval. To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://bytedance.github.io/Video-As-Prompt</p></details> |
| **[Generative Adversarial Networks for Video-to-Video Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08058v1)** | 2020-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endoscopic videos from multicentres often have different imaging conditions, e.g., color and illumination, which make the models trained on one domain usually fail to generalize well to another. Domain adaptation is one of the potential solutions to address the problem. However, few of existing works focused on the translation of video-based data. In this work, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN), namely VideoGAN, to transfer the video-based data across different domains. As the frames of a video may have similar content and imaging conditions, the proposed VideoGAN has an X-shape generator to preserve the intra-video consistency during translation. Furthermore, a loss function, namely color histogram loss, is proposed to tune the color distribution of each translated frame. Two colonoscopic datasets from different centres, i.e., CVC-Clinic and ETIS-Larib, are adopted to evaluate the performance of domain adaptation of our VideoGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that the adapted colonoscopic video generated by our VideoGAN can significantly boost the segmentation accuracy, i.e., an improvement of 5%, of colorectal polyps on multicentre datasets. As our VideoGAN is a general network architecture, we also evaluate its performance with the CamVid driving video dataset on the cloudy-to-sunny translation task. Comprehensive experiments show that the domain gap could be substantially narrowed down by our VideoGAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2020</p></details> |

Although significant progress has been made in the image domain, few-shot video classification is relatively unexplored. We argue that previous methods underestimate the importance of video feature learning and propose to learn spatiotemporal features using a 3D CNN. Proposing a two-stage approach that learns video features on base classes followed by fine-tuning the classifiers on novel classes, we show that this simple baseline approach outperforms prior few-shot video classification methods by over 20 points on existing benchmarks. To circumvent the need of labeled examples, we present two novel approaches that yield further improvement. First, we leverage tag-labeled videos from a large dataset using tag retrieval followed by selecting the best clips with visual similarities. Second, we learn generative adversarial networks that generate video features of novel classes from their semantic embeddings. Moreover, we find existing benchmarks are limited because they only focus on 5 novel classes in each testing episode and introduce more realistic benchmarks by involving more novel classes, i.e. few-shot learning, as well as a mixture of novel and base classes, i.e. generalized few-shot learning. The experimental results show that our retrieval and feature generation approach significantly outperform the baseline approach on the new benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI in October, 2021</p></details> |
| **[Generative Video Matting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07905v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video matting has traditionally been limited by the lack of high-quality ground-truth data. Most existing video matting datasets provide only human-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be composited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the generalization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is typically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two perspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by pursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also develop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse human bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a 3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting approach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video diffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong priors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video matting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal information, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong temporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across three benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance, and present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes, illustrating the strong generalization capability of our method.

We identify critical design decisions--adjusted noise schedules for diffusion, and multi-stage training that enable us to directly generate high quality and high resolution videos, without requiring a deep cascade of models as in prior work. In human evaluations, our generated videos are strongly preferred in quality compared to all prior work--81% vs. Google's Imagen Video, 90% vs. Nvidia's PYOCO, and 96% vs. Meta's Make-A-Video. Our model outperforms commercial solutions such as RunwayML's Gen2 and Pika Labs. Finally, our factorizing approach naturally lends itself to animating images based on a user's text prompt, where our generations are preferred 96% over prior work.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, project page: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/OmniVideo_project/</p></details> |
| **[Sound-Guided Semantic Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.09273v4)** | 2022-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success in StyleGAN demonstrates that pre-trained StyleGAN latent space is useful for realistic video generation. However, the generated motion in the video is usually not semantically meaningful due to the difficulty of determining the direction and magnitude in the StyleGAN latent space. In this paper, we propose a framework to generate realistic videos by leveraging multimodal (sound-image-text) embedding space. As sound provides the temporal contexts of the scene, our framework learns to generate a video that is semantically consistent with sound. First, our sound inversion module maps the audio directly into the StyleGAN latent space. We then incorporate the CLIP-based multimodal embedding space to further provide the audio-visual relationships. Finally, the proposed frame generator learns to find the trajectory in the latent space which is coherent with the corresponding sound and generates a video in a hierarchical manner. We provide the new high-resolution landscape video dataset (audio-visual pair) for the sound-guided video generation task. The experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of video quality. We further show several applications including image and video editing to verify the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMUNI: Decomposing Common and Unique Video Signals for Diffusion-based Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01718v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since videos record objects moving coherently, adjacent video frames have commonness (similar object appearances) and uniqueness (slightly changed postures). To prevent redundant modeling of common video signals, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework, named COMUNI, which decomposes the COMmon and UNIque video signals to enable efficient video generation. Our approach separates the decomposition of video signals from the task of video generation, thus reducing the computation complexity of generative models. In particular, we introduce CU-VAE to decompose video signals and encode them into latent features. To train CU-VAE in a self-supervised manner, we employ a cascading merge module to reconstitute video signals and a time-agnostic video decoder to reconstruct video frames. Then we propose CU-LDM to model latent features for video generation, which adopts two specific diffusion streams to simultaneously model the common and unique latent features. We further utilize additional joint modules for cross modeling of the common and unique latent features, and a novel position embedding method to ensure the content consistency and motion coherence of generated videos. The position embedding method incorporates spatial and temporal absolute position information into the joint modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate the necessity of decomposing common and unique video signals for video generation and the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Narration Generation for Cartoon Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06803v1)** | 2021-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on text generation from multimodal inputs has largely focused on static images, and less on video data. In this paper, we propose a new task, narration generation, that is complementing videos with narration texts that are to be interjected in several places. The narrations are part of the video and contribute to the storyline unfolding in it. Moreover, they are context-informed, since they include information appropriate for the timeframe of video they cover, and also, do not need to include every detail shown in input scenes, as a caption would. We collect a new dataset from the animated television series Peppa Pig. Furthermore, we formalize the task of narration generation as including two separate tasks, timing and content generation, and present a set of models on the new task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text Synopsis Generation for Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03804v2)** | 2020-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mass utilization of body-worn cameras has led to a huge corpus of available egocentric video. Existing video summarization algorithms can accelerate browsing such videos by selecting (visually) interesting shots from them. Nonetheless, since the system user still has to watch the summary videos, browsing large video databases remain a challenge. Hence, in this work, we propose to generate a textual synopsis, consisting of a few sentences describing the most important events in a long egocentric videos. Users can read the short text to gain insight about the video, and more importantly, efficiently search through the content of a large video database using text queries. Since egocentric videos are long and contain many activities and events, using video-to-text algorithms results in thousands of descriptions, many of which are incorrect. Therefore, we propose a multi-task learning scheme to simultaneously generate descriptions for video segments and summarize the resulting descriptions in an end-to-end fashion. We Input a set of video shots and the network generates a text description for each shot. Next, visual-language content matching unit that is trained with a weakly supervised objective, identifies the correct descriptions. Finally, the last component of our network, called purport network, evaluates the descriptions all together to select the ones containing crucial information. Out of thousands of descriptions generated for the video, a few informative sentences are returned to the user. We validate our framework on the challenging UT Egocentric video dataset, where each video is between 3 to 5 hours long, associated with over 3000 textual descriptions on average. The generated textual summaries, including only 5 percent (or less) of the generated descriptions, are compared to groundtruth summaries in text domain using well-established metrics in natural language processing.</p></details> | ICPR 2020 |

The introduction of Sora-alike models represents a pivotal breakthrough in video generation technologies, significantly enhancing the quality of synthesized videos.

SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Alternative methods break long videos down into sequential generation of short video segments, requiring multiple sampling chain iterations and specialized consistency modules. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new paradigm called Video Interface Networks (VINs), which augment DiTs with an abstraction module to enable parallel inference of video chunks. At each diffusion step, VINs encode global semantics from the noisy input of local chunks and the encoded representations, in turn, guide DiTs in denoising chunks in parallel. The coupling of VIN and DiT is learned end-to-end on the denoising objective. Further, the VIN architecture maintains fixed-size encoding tokens that encode the input via a single cross-attention step. Disentangling the encoding tokens from the input thus enables VIN to scale to long videos and learn essential semantics. Experiments on VBench demonstrate that VINs surpass existing chunk-based methods in preserving background consistency and subject coherence. We then show via an optical flow analysis that our approach attains state-of-the-art motion smoothness while using 25-40% fewer FLOPs than full generation. Finally, human raters favorably assessed the overall video quality and temporal consistency of our method in a user study.</p></details> |  |

Our approach has two key design decisions. First, we use a causal encoder to jointly compress images and videos within a unified latent space, enabling training and generation across modalities. Second, for memory and training efficiency, we use a window attention architecture tailored for joint spatial and spatiotemporal generative modeling. Taken together these design decisions enable us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on established video (UCF-101 and Kinetics-600) and image (ImageNet) generation benchmarks without using classifier free guidance. Finally, we also train a cascade of three models for the task of text-to-video generation consisting of a base latent video diffusion model, and two video super-resolution diffusion models to generate videos of $512 \times 896$ resolution at $8$ frames per second.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website https://walt-video-diffusion.github.io/</p></details> |

Due to the computation resource constraints, video generation models can only generate video clips that are relatively short compared with the length of real videos. Existing works apply a sliding window approach to generate long videos at inference time, which is often limited to generating recurrent events or homogeneous content. To generate long videos covering diverse content and multiple events, we propose to use additional guidance to control the video generation process. We further present a two-stage approach to the problem, which allows us to utilize existing video generation models to generate high-quality videos within a small time window while modeling the video holistically based on the input guidance. The proposed approach is complementary to existing efforts on video generation, which focus on generating realistic video within a fixed time window. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world videos validate the benefit of the proposed method, which improves over state-of-the-art by up to 9.5% in objective metrics and is preferred by users more than 80% of time.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that this is because there is no explicit supervision in terms of spatial tracking at the feature level. We propose Track4Gen, a spatially aware video generator that combines video diffusion loss with point tracking across frames, providing enhanced spatial supervision on the diffusion features. Track4Gen merges the video generation and point tracking tasks into a single network by making minimal changes to existing video generation architectures. Using Stable Video Diffusion as a backbone, Track4Gen demonstrates that it is possible to unify video generation and point tracking, which are typically handled as separate tasks. Our extensive evaluations show that Track4Gen effectively reduces appearance drift, resulting in temporally stable and visually coherent video generation.

While some prior works have applied such image GANs to unconditional 2D portrait video generation and static 3D portrait synthesis, there are few works successfully extending GANs for generating 3D-aware portrait videos. In this work, we propose PV3D, the first generative framework that can synthesize multi-view consistent portrait videos. Specifically, our method extends the recent static 3D-aware image GAN to the video domain by generalizing the 3D implicit neural representation to model the spatio-temporal space. To introduce motion dynamics to the generation process, we develop a motion generator by stacking multiple motion layers to generate motion features via modulated convolution. To alleviate motion ambiguities caused by camera/human motions, we propose a simple yet effective camera condition strategy for PV3D, enabling both temporal and multi-view consistent video generation. Moreover, PV3D introduces two discriminators for regularizing the spatial and temporal domains to ensure the plausibility of the generated portrait videos. These elaborated designs enable PV3D to generate 3D-aware motion-plausible portrait videos with high-quality appearance and geometry, significantly outperforming prior works. As a result, PV3D is able to support many downstream applications such as animating static portraits and view-consistent video motion editing.

While diffusion models have been successfully applied for image editing, very few works have done so for video editing. We present the first diffusion-based method that is able to perform text-based motion and appearance editing of general videos. Our approach uses a video diffusion model to combine, at inference time, the low-resolution spatio-temporal information from the original video with new, high resolution information that it synthesized to align with the guiding text prompt. As obtaining high-fidelity to the original video requires retaining some of its high-resolution information, we add a preliminary stage of finetuning the model on the original video, significantly boosting fidelity. We propose to improve motion editability by a new, mixed objective that jointly finetunes with full temporal attention and with temporal attention masking. We further introduce a new framework for image animation. We first transform the image into a coarse video by simple image processing operations such as replication and perspective geometric projections, and then use our general video editor to animate it. As a further application, we can use our method for subject-driven video generation. Extensive qualitative and numerical experiments showcase the remarkable editing ability of our method and establish its superior performance compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Layered Controllable Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12747v3)** | 2022-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce layered controllable video generation, where we, without any supervision, decompose the initial frame of a video into foreground and background layers, with which the user can control the video generation process by simply manipulating the foreground mask. The key challenges are the unsupervised foreground-background separation, which is ambiguous, and ability to anticipate user manipulations with access to only raw video sequences. We address these challenges by proposing a two-stage learning procedure. In the first stage, with the rich set of losses and dynamic foreground size prior, we learn how to separate the frame into foreground and background layers and, conditioned on these layers, how to generate the next frame using VQ-VAE generator. In the second stage, we fine-tune this network to anticipate edits to the mask, by fitting (parameterized) control to the mask from future frame. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this learning and the more granular control mechanism, while illustrating state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.

Although many attempts using GANs and autoregressive models have been made in this area, the visual quality and length of generated videos are far from satisfactory. Diffusion models have shown remarkable results recently but require significant computational resources. To address this, we introduce lightweight video diffusion models by leveraging a low-dimensional 3D latent space, significantly outperforming previous pixel-space video diffusion models under a limited computational budget. In addition, we propose hierarchical diffusion in the latent space such that longer videos with more than one thousand frames can be produced. To further overcome the performance degradation issue for long video generation, we propose conditional latent perturbation and unconditional guidance that effectively mitigate the accumulated errors during the extension of video length. Extensive experiments on small domain datasets of different categories suggest that our framework generates more realistic and longer videos than previous strong baselines. We additionally provide an extension to large-scale text-to-video generation to demonstrate the superiority of our work.

| **[VideoAgent: Self-Improving Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10076v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has been used to generate visual plans for controlling robotic systems. Given an image observation and a language instruction, previous work has generated video plans which are then converted to robot controls to be executed. However, a major bottleneck in leveraging video generation for control lies in the quality of the generated videos, which often suffer from hallucinatory content and unrealistic physics, resulting in low task success when control actions are extracted from the generated videos. While scaling up dataset and model size provides a partial solution, integrating external feedback is both natural and essential for grounding video generation in the real world. With this observation, we propose VideoAgent for self-improving generated video plans based on external feedback. Instead of directly executing the generated video plan, VideoAgent first refines the generated video plans using a novel procedure which we call self-conditioning consistency, allowing inference-time compute to be turned into better generated video plans. As the refined video plan is being executed, VideoAgent can collect additional data from the environment to further improve video plan generation. Experiments in simulated robotic manipulation from MetaWorld and iTHOR show that VideoAgent drastically reduces hallucination, thereby boosting success rate of downstream manipulation tasks. We further illustrate that VideoAgent can effectively refine real-robot videos, providing an early indicator that robots can be an effective tool in grounding video generation in the physical world.

Specifically, we propose a video auto-encoder, where a video encoder encodes videos into global features, and a video decoder, built on a diffusion model, decodes the global features and synthesizes video frames in a non-autoregressive manner. To achieve maximum flexibility, our video decoder perceives temporal information through normalized frame indexes, which enables it to synthesize arbitrary sub video clips with predetermined starting and ending frame indexes. Moreover, a novel adversarial loss is introduced to improve the global coherence and local realism between the synthesized video frames. Finally, we employ a diffusion-based video generator to fit the global features outputted by the video encoder for video generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method, and new state-of-the-art results have been achieved on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Latent Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09987v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceptual optimization is widely recognized as essential for neural compression, yet balancing the rate-distortion-perception tradeoff remains challenging. This difficulty is especially pronounced in video compression, where frame-wise quality fluctuations often cause perceptually optimized neural video codecs to suffer from flickering artifacts. In this paper, inspired by the success of latent generative models, we present Generative Latent Video Compression (GLVC), an effective framework for perceptual video compression. GLVC employs a pretrained continuous tokenizer to project video frames into a perceptually aligned latent space, thereby offloading perceptual constraints from the rate-distortion optimization. We redesign the codec architecture explicitly for the latent domain, drawing on extensive insights from prior neural video codecs, and further equip it with innovations such as unified intra/inter coding and a recurrent memory mechanism. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that GLVC achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of DISTS and LPIPS metrics. Notably, our user study confirms GLVC rivals the latest neural video codecs at nearly half their rate while maintaining stable temporal coherence, marking a step toward practical perceptual video compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In this paper, we use video generation as a proxy for robot policy learning to address both limitations simultaneously. We propose Video Policy, a modular framework that combines video and action generation that can be trained end-to-end. Our results demonstrate that learning to generate videos of robot behavior allows for the extraction of policies with minimal demonstration data, significantly improving robustness and sample efficiency. Our method shows strong generalization to unseen objects, backgrounds, and tasks, both in simulation and the real world. We further highlight that task success is closely tied to the generated video, with action-free video data providing critical benefits for generalizing to novel tasks. By leveraging large-scale video generative models, we achieve superior performance compared to traditional behavior cloning, paving the way for more scalable and data-efficient robot policy learning.</p></details> |  |

It reduces the necessary generation time of similarly sized video diffusion models from 25 seconds to around 1 second while maintaining the same level of performance. The method's effectiveness lies in its dual-level decoupling learning approach: 1) separating the learning of video style from video generation acceleration, which allows for personalized style video generation without any personalized style video data, and 2) separating the acceleration of image generation from the acceleration of video motion generation, enhancing training efficiency and mitigating the negative effects of low-quality video data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Short Paper by SIGGRAPH ASIA 2024 Technical Communications.

Unlike existing works that rely on symbolic musical annotations, which are limited in quantity and diversity, our method leverages large-scale web videos accompanied by background music. This enables our model to learn to generate realistic and diverse music. To accomplish this goal, we develop a generative video-music Transformer with a novel semantic video-music alignment scheme. Our model uses a joint autoregressive and contrastive learning objective, which encourages the generation of music aligned with high-level video content. We also introduce a novel video-beat alignment scheme to match the generated music beats with the low-level motions in the video. Lastly, to capture fine-grained visual cues in a video needed for realistic background music generation, we introduce a new temporal video encoder architecture, allowing us to efficiently process videos consisting of many densely sampled frames. We train our framework on our newly curated DISCO-MV dataset, consisting of 2.2M video-music samples, which is orders of magnitude larger than any prior datasets used for video music generation. Our method outperforms existing approaches on the DISCO-MV and MusicCaps datasets according to various music generation evaluation metrics, including human evaluation.

| **[Point-to-Point Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02912v2)** | 2019-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While image manipulation achieves tremendous breakthroughs (e.g., generating realistic faces) in recent years, video generation is much less explored and harder to control, which limits its applications in the real world. For instance, video editing requires temporal coherence across multiple clips and thus poses both start and end constraints within a video sequence. We introduce point-to-point video generation that controls the generation process with two control points: the targeted start- and end-frames. The task is challenging since the model not only generates a smooth transition of frames, but also plans ahead to ensure that the generated end-frame conforms to the targeted end-frame for videos of various length. We propose to maximize the modified variational lower bound of conditional data likelihood under a skip-frame training strategy. Our model can generate sequences such that their end-frame is consistent with the targeted end-frame without loss of quality and diversity. Extensive experiments are conducted on Stochastic Moving MNIST, Weizmann Human Action, and Human3.6M to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We demonstrate our method under a series of scenarios (e.g., dynamic length generation) and the qualitative results showcase the potential and merits of point-to-point generation.

In this work, we propose to decompose videos into visual primitives - blob video representation, a general representation for controllable video generation. Based on blob conditions, we develop a blob-grounded video diffusion model named BlobGEN-Vid that allows users to control object motions and fine-grained object appearance. In particular, we introduce a masked 3D attention module that effectively improves regional consistency across frames. In addition, we introduce a learnable module to interpolate text embeddings so that users can control semantics in specific frames and obtain smooth object transitions. We show that our framework is model-agnostic and build BlobGEN-Vid based on both U-Net and DiT-based video diffusion models. Extensive experimental results show that BlobGEN-Vid achieves superior zero-shot video generation ability and state-of-the-art layout controllability on multiple benchmarks. When combined with an LLM for layout planning, our framework even outperforms proprietary text-to-video generators in terms of compositional accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://blobgen-vid2.github.io/</p></details> |

However, precise control over the video generation process, such as camera manipulation or content editing, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for controlled video generation are typically limited to a single control type, lacking the flexibility to handle diverse control demands. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple video control tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achieving versatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videos are fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as control inputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovation allows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the 3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their ability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800 GPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilities across diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control, motion transfer, and object manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://igl-hkust.github.io/das/ Codes: https://github.com/IGL-HKUST/DiffusionAsShader</p></details> |
| **[End-to-End Video Question-Answer Generation with Generator-Pretester Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01447v1)** | 2021-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a novel task, Video Question-Answer Generation (VQAG), for challenging Video Question Answering (Video QA) task in multimedia. Due to expensive data annotation costs, many widely used, large-scale Video QA datasets such as Video-QA, MSVD-QA and MSRVTT-QA are automatically annotated using Caption Question Generation (CapQG) which inputs captions instead of the video itself. As captions neither fully represent a video, nor are they always practically available, it is crucial to generate question-answer pairs based on a video via Video Question-Answer Generation (VQAG). Existing video-to-text (V2T) approaches, despite taking a video as the input, only generate a question alone. In this work, we propose a novel model Generator-Pretester Network that focuses on two components: (1) The Joint Question-Answer Generator (JQAG) which generates a question with its corresponding answer to allow Video Question "Answering" training. (2) The Pretester (PT) verifies a generated question by trying to answer it and checks the pretested answer with both the model's proposed answer and the ground truth answer. We evaluate our system with the only two available large-scale human-annotated Video QA datasets and achieves state-of-the-art question generation performances. Furthermore, using our generated QA pairs only on the Video QA task, we can surpass some supervised baselines. We apply our generated questions to Video QA applications and surpasses some supervised baselines using generated questions only. As a pre-training strategy, we outperform both CapQG and transfer learning approaches when employing semi-supervised (20%) or fully supervised learning with annotated data. These experimental results suggest the novel perspectives for Video QA training.</p></details> | Accepted to TCSVT |
| **[Collaborative Video Diffusion: Consistent Multi-video Generation with Camera Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17414v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on video generation has recently made tremendous progress, enabling high-quality videos to be generated from text prompts or images. Adding control to the video generation process is an important goal moving forward and recent approaches that condition video generation models on camera trajectories make strides towards it. Yet, it remains challenging to generate a video of the same scene from multiple different camera trajectories. Solutions to this multi-video generation problem could enable large-scale 3D scene generation with editable camera trajectories, among other applications. We introduce collaborative video diffusion (CVD) as an important step towards this vision. The CVD framework includes a novel cross-video synchronization module that promotes consistency between corresponding frames of the same video rendered from different camera poses using an epipolar attention mechanism. Trained on top of a state-of-the-art camera-control module for video generation, CVD generates multiple videos rendered from different camera trajectories with significantly better consistency than baselines, as shown in extensive experiments.

| **[Improving Video Generation for Multi-functional Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11453v2)** | 2018-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to improve the state-of-the-art video generative adversarial networks (GANs) with a view towards multi-functional applications. Our improved video GAN model does not separate foreground from background nor dynamic from static patterns, but learns to generate the entire video clip conjointly. Our model can thus be trained to generate - and learn from - a broad set of videos with no restriction. This is achieved by designing a robust one-stream video generation architecture with an extension of the state-of-the-art Wasserstein GAN framework that allows for better convergence. The experimental results show that our improved video GAN model outperforms state-of-theart video generative models on multiple challenging datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of our model by successfully extending it to three challenging problems: video colorization, video inpainting, and future prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work using GANs to colorize and inpaint video clips.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often struggle to achieve robust music-video correspondence and generative diversity, primarily due to inadequate feature alignment methods and insufficient datasets. In this study, we present General Video-to-Music Generation model (GVMGen), designed for generating high-related music to the video input. Our model employs hierarchical attentions to extract and align video features with music in both spatial and temporal dimensions, ensuring the preservation of pertinent features while minimizing redundancy. Remarkably, our method is versatile, capable of generating multi-style music from different video inputs, even in zero-shot scenarios. We also propose an evaluation model along with two novel objective metrics for assessing video-music alignment. Additionally, we have compiled a large-scale dataset comprising diverse types of video-music pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that GVMGen surpasses previous models in terms of music-video correspondence, generative diversity, and application universality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

Despite the rapid progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation. It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs, mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions, conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, Project Page:https://hyelinnam.github.io/Cameo/</p></details> |

However, these methods cannot be directly applied to user-provided videos that are not generated by a video model. In this paper, we present ReCapture, a method for generating new videos with novel camera trajectories from a single user-provided video. Our method allows us to re-generate the reference video, with all its existing scene motion, from vastly different angles and with cinematic camera motion. Notably, using our method we can also plausibly hallucinate parts of the scene that were not observable in the reference video. Our method works by (1) generating a noisy anchor video with a new camera trajectory using multiview diffusion models or depth-based point cloud rendering and then (2) regenerating the anchor video into a clean and temporally consistent reangled video using our proposed masked video fine-tuning technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://generative-video-camera-controls.github.io/</p></details> |

However, existing surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large language models in enhancing human motion video generation.

We adopt a new perspective towards video generation where we allow the captions to be combined with the long-term and short-term dependencies between video frames and thus generate a video in an incremental manner. Our experiments demonstrate our network architecture's ability to distinguish between objects, actions and interactions in a video and combine them to generate videos for unseen captions. The network also exhibits the capability to perform spatio-temporal style transfer when asked to generate videos for a sequence of captions. We also show that the network's ability to learn a latent representation allows it generate videos in an unsupervised manner and perform other tasks such as action recognition.

Building on this success, Lumina-Next achieves exceptional performance in the generation of photorealistic images with Next-DiT. However, its potential for video generation remains largely untapped, with significant challenges in modeling the spatiotemporal complexity inherent to video data. To address this, we introduce Lumina-Video, a framework that leverages the strengths of Next-DiT while introducing tailored solutions for video synthesis. Lumina-Video incorporates a Multi-scale Next-DiT architecture, which jointly learns multiple patchifications to enhance both efficiency and flexibility. By incorporating the motion score as an explicit condition, Lumina-Video also enables direct control of generated videos' dynamic degree. Combined with a progressive training scheme with increasingly higher resolution and FPS, and a multi-source training scheme with mixed natural and synthetic data, Lumina-Video achieves remarkable aesthetic quality and motion smoothness at high training and inference efficiency. We additionally propose Lumina-V2A, a video-to-audio model based on Next-DiT, to create synchronized sounds for generated videos.

| **[Generative Video Diffusion for Unseen Novel Semantic Video Moment Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13329v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video moment retrieval (VMR) aims to locate the most likely video moment(s) corresponding to a text query in untrimmed videos. Training of existing methods is limited by the lack of diverse and generalisable VMR datasets, hindering their ability to generalise moment-text associations to queries containing novel semantic concepts (unseen both visually and textually in a training source domain). For model generalisation to novel semantics, existing methods rely heavily on assuming to have access to both video and text sentence pairs from a target domain in addition to the source domain pair-wise training data. This is neither practical nor scalable. In this work, we introduce a more generalisable approach by assuming only text sentences describing new semantics are available in model training without having seen any videos from a target domain. To that end, we propose a Fine-grained Video Editing framework, termed FVE, that explores generative video diffusion to facilitate fine-grained video editing from the seen source concepts to the unseen target sentences consisting of new concepts. This enables generative hypotheses of unseen video moments corresponding to the novel concepts in the target domain. This fine-grained generative video diffusion retains the original video structure and subject specifics from the source domain while introducing semantic distinctions of unseen novel vocabularies in the target domain. A critical challenge is how to enable this generative fine-grained diffusion process to be meaningful in optimising VMR, more than just synthesising visually pleasing videos. We solve this problem by introducing a hybrid selection mechanism that integrates three quantitative metrics to selectively incorporate synthetic video moments (novel video hypotheses) as enlarged additions to the original source training data, whilst minimising potential ...</p></details> | AAAI-25 |
| **[Synchronized Video Storytelling: Generating Video Narrations with Structured Storyline](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14040v2)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video storytelling is engaging multimedia content that utilizes video and its accompanying narration to attract the audience, where a key challenge is creating narrations for recorded visual scenes. Previous studies on dense video captioning and video story generation have made some progress. However, in practical applications, we typically require synchronized narrations for ongoing visual scenes. In this work, we introduce a new task of Synchronized Video Storytelling, which aims to generate synchronous and informative narrations for videos. These narrations, associated with each video clip, should relate to the visual content, integrate relevant knowledge, and have an appropriate word count corresponding to the clip's duration. Specifically, a structured storyline is beneficial to guide the generation process, ensuring coherence and integrity. To support the exploration of this task, we introduce a new benchmark dataset E-SyncVidStory with rich annotations. Since existing Multimodal LLMs are not effective in addressing this task in one-shot or few-shot settings, we propose a framework named VideoNarrator that can generate a storyline for input videos and simultaneously generate narrations with the guidance of the generated or predefined storyline. We further introduce a set of evaluation metrics to thoroughly assess the generation. Both automatic and human evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our dataset, codes, and evaluations will be released.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fréchet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.</p></details> |  |

Latte first extracts spatio-temporal tokens from input videos and then adopts a series of Transformer blocks to model video distribution in the latent space. In order to model a substantial number of tokens extracted from videos, four efficient variants are introduced from the perspective of decomposing the spatial and temporal dimensions of input videos. To improve the quality of generated videos, we determine the best practices of Latte through rigorous experimental analysis, including video clip patch embedding, model variants, timestep-class information injection, temporal positional embedding, and learning strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that Latte achieves state-of-the-art performance across four standard video generation datasets, i.e., FaceForensics, SkyTimelapse, UCF101, and Taichi-HD. In addition, we extend Latte to the text-to-video generation (T2V) task, where Latte achieves results that are competitive with recent T2V models. We strongly believe that Latte provides valuable insights for future research on incorporating Transformers into diffusion models for video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Machine Learning Research 2025; Project Page: https://maxin-cn.github.io/latte_project</p></details> |

We explore this path for the case of echocardiograms by looking into the variation of the Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction, the most essential clinical metric gained from these examinations. We combine deep neural networks, twin causal networks and generative adversarial methods for the first time to build D'ARTAGNAN (Deep ARtificial Twin-Architecture GeNerAtive Networks), a novel causal generative model. We demonstrate the soundness of our approach on a synthetic dataset before applying it to cardiac ultrasound videos to answer the question: "What would this echocardiogram look like if the patient had a different ejection fraction?". To do so, we generate new ultrasound videos, retaining the video style and anatomy of the original patient, while modifying the Ejection Fraction conditioned on a given input.

It is important to understand their potential to produce unsafe content, such as violent or terrifying videos. In this work, we provide a comprehensive understanding of unsafe video generation. First, to confirm the possibility that these models could indeed generate unsafe videos, we choose unsafe content generation prompts collected from 4chan and Lexica, and three open-source SOTA VGMs to generate unsafe videos. After filtering out duplicates and poorly generated content, we created an initial set of 2112 unsafe videos from an original pool of 5607 videos. Through clustering and thematic coding analysis of these generated videos, we identify 5 unsafe video categories: Distorted/Weird, Terrifying, Pornographic, Violent/Bloody, and Political. With IRB approval, we then recruit online participants to help label the generated videos. Based on the annotations submitted by 403 participants, we identified 937 unsafe videos from the initial video set. With the labeled information and the corresponding prompts, we created the first dataset of unsafe videos generated by VGMs. We then study possible defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of unsafe videos. Existing defense methods in image generation focus on filtering either input prompt or output results. We propose a new approach called Latent Variable Defense (LVD), which works within the model's internal sampling process. LVD can achieve 0.90 defense accuracy while reducing time and computing resources by 10x when sampling a large number of unsafe prompts.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Controllable Video Generation with Provable Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02690v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable video generation remains a significant challenge, despite recent advances in generating high-quality and consistent videos. Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sentence Specified Dynamic Video Thumbnail Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04052v2)** | 2019-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the tremendous growth of videos over the Internet, video thumbnails, providing video content previews, are becoming increasingly crucial to influencing users' online searching experiences. Conventional video thumbnails are generated once purely based on the visual characteristics of videos, and then displayed as requested. Hence, such video thumbnails, without considering the users' searching intentions, cannot provide a meaningful snapshot of the video contents that users concern. In this paper, we define a distinctively new task, namely sentence specified dynamic video thumbnail generation, where the generated thumbnails not only provide a concise preview of the original video contents but also dynamically relate to the users' searching intentions with semantic correspondences to the users' query sentences. To tackle such a challenging task, we propose a novel graph convolved video thumbnail pointer (GTP). Specifically, GTP leverages a sentence specified video graph convolutional network to model both the sentence-video semantic interaction and the internal video relationships incorporated with the sentence information, based on which a temporal conditioned pointer network is then introduced to sequentially generate the sentence specified video thumbnails. Moreover, we annotate a new dataset based on ActivityNet Captions for the proposed new task, which consists of 10,000+ video-sentence pairs with each accompanied by an annotated sentence specified video thumbnail. We demonstrate that our proposed GTP outperforms several baseline methods on the created dataset, and thus believe that our initial results along with the release of the new dataset will inspire further research on sentence specified dynamic video thumbnail generation. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/yytzsy/GTP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Video Generation on Complex Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06571v2)** | 2019-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models of natural images have progressed towards high fidelity samples by the strong leveraging of scale. We attempt to carry this success to the field of video modeling by showing that large Generative Adversarial Networks trained on the complex Kinetics-600 dataset are able to produce video samples of substantially higher complexity and fidelity than previous work. Our proposed model, Dual Video Discriminator GAN (DVD-GAN), scales to longer and higher resolution videos by leveraging a computationally efficient decomposition of its discriminator. We evaluate on the related tasks of video synthesis and video prediction, and achieve new state-of-the-art Fréchet Inception Distance for prediction for Kinetics-600, as well as state-of-the-art Inception Score for synthesis on the UCF-101 dataset, alongside establishing a strong baseline for synthesis on Kinetics-600.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware Talking Face Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18092v1)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider a novel and practical case for talking face video generation. Specifically, we focus on the scenarios involving multi-people interactions, where the talking context, such as audience or surroundings, is present. In these situations, the video generation should take the context into consideration in order to generate video content naturally aligned with driving audios and spatially coherent to the context. To achieve this, we provide a two-stage and cross-modal controllable video generation pipeline, taking facial landmarks as an explicit and compact control signal to bridge the driving audio, talking context and generated videos. Inside this pipeline, we devise a 3D video diffusion model, allowing for efficient contort of both spatial conditions (landmarks and context video), as well as audio condition for temporally coherent generation. The experimental results verify the advantage of the proposed method over other baselines in terms of audio-video synchronization, video fidelity and frame consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Video Editing as Flow-Driven Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07713v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[VidPanos: Generative Panoramic Videos from Casual Panning Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13832v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic image stitching provides a unified, wide-angle view of a scene that extends beyond the camera's field of view. Stitching frames of a panning video into a panoramic photograph is a well-understood problem for stationary scenes, but when objects are moving, a still panorama cannot capture the scene. We present a method for synthesizing a panoramic video from a casually-captured panning video, as if the original video were captured with a wide-angle camera. We pose panorama synthesis as a space-time outpainting problem, where we aim to create a full panoramic video of the same length as the input video. Consistent completion of the space-time volume requires a powerful, realistic prior over video content and motion, for which we adapt generative video models. Existing generative models do not, however, immediately extend to panorama completion, as we show. We instead apply video generation as a component of our panorama synthesis system, and demonstrate how to exploit the strengths of the models while minimizing their limitations. Our system can create video panoramas for a range of in-the-wild scenes including people, vehicles, and flowing water, as well as stationary background features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://vidpanos.github.io/.

Nevertheless, progress on perceptual quality assessmentof UGC videos still remains quite limited. There are many distinguished characteristics of UGC videos in the complete video production and delivery chain, and one important property closely relevant to video quality is that there does not exist the pristine source after they are uploaded to the hosting platform,such that they often undergo multiple compression stages before ultimately viewed. To facilitate the UGC video quality assessment,we created a UGC video perceptual quality assessment database. It contains 50 source videos collected from TikTok with diverse content, along with multiple distortion versions generated bythe compression with different quantization levels and coding standards. Subjective quality assessment was conducted to evaluate the video quality. Furthermore, we benchmark the database using existing quality assessment algorithms, and potential roomis observed to future improve the accuracy of UGC video quality measures.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in this field have also enabled high-quality 3D or video content to be generated that exhibits either multi-view or temporal consistency.

By combining neural implicit representations with time-aware discriminator, we develop a GAN framework that synthesizes 3D video supervised only with monocular videos.

| **[A General Framework for Edited Video and Raw Video Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10669v1)** | 2019-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we build a general summarization framework for both of edited video and raw video summarization. Overall, our work can be divided into three folds: 1) Four models are designed to capture the properties of video summaries, i.e., containing important people and objects (importance), representative to the video content (representativeness), no similar key-shots (diversity) and smoothness of the storyline (storyness). Specifically, these models are applicable to both edited videos and raw videos. 2) A comprehensive score function is built with the weighted combination of the aforementioned four models. Note that the weights of the four models in the score function, denoted as property-weight, are learned in a supervised manner. Besides, the property-weights are learned for edited videos and raw videos, respectively. 3) The training set is constructed with both edited videos and raw videos in order to make up the lack of training data. Particularly, each training video is equipped with a pair of mixing-coefficients which can reduce the structure mess in the training set caused by the rough mixture. We test our framework on three datasets, including edited videos, short raw videos and long raw videos. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

It highlights the innovative use of these technologies in producing highly realistic videos, a significant leap in bridging the gap between real-world dynamics and digital creation. The study also delves into the advanced capabilities of LLMs in video understanding, demonstrating their effectiveness in extracting meaningful information from visual content, thereby enhancing our interaction with videos. In the realm of video streaming, the paper discusses how LLMs contribute to more efficient and user-centric streaming experiences, adapting content delivery to individual viewer preferences. This comprehensive review navigates through the current achievements, ongoing challenges, and future possibilities of applying Generative AI and LLMs to video-related tasks, underscoring the immense potential these technologies hold for advancing the field of video technology related to multimedia, networking, and AI communities.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Can Text-to-Video Generation help Video-Language Alignment?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18507v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video-language alignment models are trained on sets of videos, each with an associated positive caption and a negative caption generated by large language models. A problem with this procedure is that negative captions may introduce linguistic biases, i.e., concepts are seen only as negatives and never associated with a video. While a solution would be to collect videos for the negative captions, existing databases lack the fine-grained variations needed to cover all possible negatives. In this work, we study whether synthetic videos can help to overcome this issue. Our preliminary analysis with multiple generators shows that, while promising on some tasks, synthetic videos harm the performance of the model on others. We hypothesize this issue is linked to noise (semantic and visual) in the generated videos and develop a method, SynViTA, that accounts for those. SynViTA dynamically weights the contribution of each synthetic video based on how similar its target caption is w.r.t. the real counterpart. Moreover, a semantic consistency loss makes the model focus on fine-grained differences across captions, rather than differences in video appearance. Experiments show that, on average, SynViTA improves over existing methods on VideoCon test sets and SSv2-Temporal, SSv2-Events, and ATP-Hard benchmarks, being a first promising step for using synthetic videos when learning video-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[MoCoGAN: Decomposing Motion and Content for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04993v2)** | 2017-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual signals in a video can be divided into content and motion. While content specifies which objects are in the video, motion describes their dynamics. Based on this prior, we propose the Motion and Content decomposed Generative Adversarial Network (MoCoGAN) framework for video generation. The proposed framework generates a video by mapping a sequence of random vectors to a sequence of video frames. Each random vector consists of a content part and a motion part. While the content part is kept fixed, the motion part is realized as a stochastic process. To learn motion and content decomposition in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a novel adversarial learning scheme utilizing both image and video discriminators. Extensive experimental results on several challenging datasets with qualitative and quantitative comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches, verify effectiveness of the proposed framework. In addition, we show that MoCoGAN allows one to generate videos with same content but different motion as well as videos with different content and same motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Generation From Text](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00421v1)** | 2017-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating videos from text has proven to be a significant challenge for existing generative models. We tackle this problem by training a conditional generative model to extract both static and dynamic information from text. This is manifested in a hybrid framework, employing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The static features, called "gist," are used to sketch text-conditioned background color and object layout structure. Dynamic features are considered by transforming input text into an image filter. To obtain a large amount of data for training the deep-learning model, we develop a method to automatically create a matched text-video corpus from publicly available online videos. Experimental results show that the proposed framework generates plausible and diverse videos, while accurately reflecting the input text information. It significantly outperforms baseline models that directly adapt text-to-image generation procedures to produce videos. Performance is evaluated both visually and by adapting the inception score used to evaluate image generation in GANs.</p></details> |  |
| **[TC-Bench: Benchmarking Temporal Compositionality in Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08656v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has many unique challenges beyond those of image generation. The temporal dimension introduces extensive possible variations across frames, over which consistency and continuity may be violated. In this study, we move beyond evaluating simple actions and argue that generated videos should incorporate the emergence of new concepts and their relation transitions like in real-world videos as time progresses. To assess the Temporal Compositionality of video generation models, we propose TC-Bench, a benchmark of meticulously crafted text prompts, corresponding ground truth videos, and robust evaluation metrics. The prompts articulate the initial and final states of scenes, effectively reducing ambiguities for frame development and simplifying the assessment of transition completion. In addition, by collecting aligned real-world videos corresponding to the prompts, we expand TC-Bench's applicability from text-conditional models to image-conditional ones that can perform generative frame interpolation. We also develop new metrics to measure the completeness of component transitions in generated videos, which demonstrate significantly higher correlations with human judgments than existing metrics. Our comprehensive experimental results reveal that most video generators achieve less than 20% of the compositional changes, highlighting enormous space for future improvement. Our analysis indicates that current video generation models struggle to interpret descriptions of compositional changes and synthesize various components across different time steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Long Videos of Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.03429v2)** | 2022-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a video generation model that accurately reproduces object motion, changes in camera viewpoint, and new content that arises over time. Existing video generation methods often fail to produce new content as a function of time while maintaining consistencies expected in real environments, such as plausible dynamics and object persistence. A common failure case is for content to never change due to over-reliance on inductive biases to provide temporal consistency, such as a single latent code that dictates content for the entire video. On the other extreme, without long-term consistency, generated videos may morph unrealistically between different scenes. To address these limitations, we prioritize the time axis by redesigning the temporal latent representation and learning long-term consistency from data by training on longer videos. To this end, we leverage a two-phase training strategy, where we separately train using longer videos at a low resolution and shorter videos at a high resolution. To evaluate the capabilities of our model, we introduce two new benchmark datasets with explicit focus on long-term temporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |

This issue underscores the urgent need for effective AI-generated video detectors to prevent the dissemination of false information through such videos. However, the development of high-performance generative video detectors is currently impeded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets specifically designed for generative video detection. To this end, we introduce GenVidBench, a challenging AI-generated video detection dataset with several key advantages: 1) Cross Source and Cross Generator: The cross-generation source mitigates the interference of video content on the detection. The cross-generator ensures diversity in video attributes between the training and test sets, preventing them from being overly similar. 2) State-of-the-Art Video Generators: The dataset includes videos from 8 state-of-the-art AI video generators, ensuring that it covers the latest advancements in the field of video generation. 3) Rich Semantics: The videos in GenVidBench are analyzed from multiple dimensions and classified into various semantic categories based on their content. This classification ensures that the dataset is not only large but also diverse, aiding in the development of more generalized and effective detection models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different advanced video generators and present a challenging setting. Additionally, we present rich experimental results including advanced video classification models as baselines. With the GenVidBench, researchers can efficiently develop and evaluate AI-generated video detection models. Datasets and code are available at https://genvidbench.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in one of the promising models that synthesizes data samples that are similar to real data samples. While the variations of GANs models, in general, have been covered to some extent in several survey papers, to the best of our knowledge, this is among the first survey papers that reviews the state-of-the-art video GANs models. This paper first categorized GANs review papers into general GANs review papers, image GANs review papers, and special field GANs review papers such as anomaly detection, medical imaging, or cybersecurity. The paper then summarizes the main improvements in GANs frameworks that are not initially developed for the video domain but have been adopted in multiple video GANs variations. Then, a comprehensive review of video GANs models is provided under two main divisions according to the presence or non-presence of a condition. The conditional models then further grouped according to the type of condition into audio, text, video, and image. The paper is concluded by highlighting the main challenges and limitations of the current video GANs models.

However, current efforts are mainly concentrated on single-objective or single-task video generation, such as generation driven by text, by image, or by a combination of text and image. This cannot fully meet the needs of real-world application scenarios, as users are likely to input images and text conditions in a flexible manner, either individually or in combination. To address this, we propose a Unified-modal Video Genearation system that is capable of handling multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. To this end, we revisit the various video generation tasks within our system from the perspective of generative freedom, and classify them into high-freedom and low-freedom video generation categories. For high-freedom video generation, we employ Multi-condition Cross Attention to generate videos that align with the semantics of the input images or text. For low-freedom video generation, we introduce Biased Gaussian Noise to replace the pure random Gaussian Noise, which helps to better preserve the content of the input conditions. Our method achieves the lowest Fréchet Video Distance (FVD) on the public academic benchmark MSR-VTT, surpasses the current open-source methods in human evaluations, and is on par with the current close-source method Gen2.

Within this context, egocentric video generation, which centers on the human perspective, holds significant potential for enhancing applications in virtual reality, augmented reality, and gaming. However, the generation of egocentric videos presents substantial challenges due to the dynamic nature of egocentric viewpoints, the intricate diversity of actions, and the complex variety of scenes encountered. Existing datasets are inadequate for addressing these challenges effectively. To bridge this gap, we present EgoVid-5M, the first high-quality dataset specifically curated for egocentric video generation. EgoVid-5M encompasses 5 million egocentric video clips and is enriched with detailed action annotations, including fine-grained kinematic control and high-level textual descriptions. To ensure the integrity and usability of the dataset, we implement a sophisticated data cleaning pipeline designed to maintain frame consistency, action coherence, and motion smoothness under egocentric conditions. Furthermore, we introduce EgoDreamer, which is capable of generating egocentric videos driven simultaneously by action descriptions and kinematic control signals.

In this survey, we systematically review the recent advances in video generation, covering five key aspects: foundation models, information representations, generation schemes, post-processing techniques, and evaluation metrics. We particularly focus on their contributions to maintaining spatiotemporal consistency.

However, creating music visualization is a complex, time-consuming, and resource-intensive process. We introduce Generative Disco, a generative AI system that helps generate music visualizations with large language models and text-to-video generation. The system helps users visualize music in intervals by finding prompts to describe the images that intervals start and end on and interpolating between them to the beat of the music. We introduce design patterns for improving these generated videos: transitions, which express shifts in color, time, subject, or style, and holds, which help focus the video on subjects. A study with professionals showed that transitions and holds were a highly expressive framework that enabled them to build coherent visual narratives. We conclude on the generalizability of these patterns and the potential of generated video for creative professionals.</p></details> |  |
| **[CV-VAE: A Compatible Video VAE for Latent Generative Video Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20279v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal compression of videos, utilizing networks such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE), plays a crucial role in OpenAI's SORA and numerous other video generative models. For instance, many LLM-like video models learn the distribution of discrete tokens derived from 3D VAEs within the VQVAE framework, while most diffusion-based video models capture the distribution of continuous latent extracted by 2D VAEs without quantization. The temporal compression is simply realized by uniform frame sampling which results in unsmooth motion between consecutive frames. Currently, there lacks of a commonly used continuous video (3D) VAE for latent diffusion-based video models in the research community. Moreover, since current diffusion-based approaches are often implemented using pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, directly training a video VAE without considering the compatibility with existing T2I models will result in a latent space gap between them, which will take huge computational resources for training to bridge the gap even with the T2I models as initialization. To address this issue, we propose a method for training a video VAE of latent video models, namely CV-VAE, whose latent space is compatible with that of a given image VAE, e.g., image VAE of Stable Diffusion (SD). The compatibility is achieved by the proposed novel latent space regularization, which involves formulating a regularization loss using the image VAE. Benefiting from the latent space compatibility, video models can be trained seamlessly from pre-trained T2I or video models in a truly spatio-temporally compressed latent space, rather than simply sampling video frames at equal intervals. With our CV-VAE, existing video models can generate four times more frames with minimal finetuning. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed video VAE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ailab-cvc.github.io/cvvae/index.html</p></details> |

To better quantify the temporal diversity, we propose a class of complementary metrics that are effective, easy to implement, data agnostic, and interpretable. Further, we observe that current state-of-the-art models are trained on video samples of fixed length thereby inhibiting long-term modeling. To address this, we reformulate the problem of video generation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The underlying idea is to represent motion as a stochastic process with an infinite forecast horizon to overcome the fixed length limitation and to mitigate the presence of temporal artifacts. We show that our formulation is easy to integrate into the state-of-the-art MoCoGAN framework. Our experiments on the Human Actions and UCF-101 datasets demonstrate that our MDP-based model is more memory efficient and improves the video quality both in terms of the new and established metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at 2019 ICCV Workshop on Large Scale Holistic Video Understanding</p></details> |

However, due to the significant gap in content and motion patterns between panoramic and standard videos, these methods encounter challenges in yielding satisfactory 360-degree panoramic videos. In this paper, we propose a pipeline named 360-Degree Video Diffusion model (360DVD) for generating 360-degree panoramic videos based on the given prompts and motion conditions. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight 360-Adapter accompanied by 360 Enhancement Techniques to transform pre-trained T2V models for panorama video generation. We further propose a new panorama dataset named WEB360 consisting of panoramic video-text pairs for training 360DVD, addressing the absence of captioned panoramic video datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of 360DVD for panorama video generation.

This paper showcases their ability to sequentially generate video, surpassing prior methods in perceptual and probabilistic forecasting metrics. We propose an autoregressive, end-to-end optimized video diffusion model inspired by recent advances in neural video compression. The model successively generates future frames by correcting a deterministic next-frame prediction using a stochastic residual generated by an inverse diffusion process. We compare this approach against five baselines on four datasets involving natural and simulation-based videos. We find significant improvements in terms of perceptual quality for all datasets. Furthermore, by introducing a scalable version of the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) applicable to video, we show that our model also outperforms existing approaches in their probabilistic frame forecasting ability.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives.

In this paper, we propose Diffusion-GAN, a novel GAN framework that leverages a forward diffusion chain to generate Gaussian-mixture distributed instance noise. Diffusion-GAN consists of three components, including an adaptive diffusion process, a diffusion timestep-dependent discriminator, and a generator. Both the observed and generated data are diffused by the same adaptive diffusion process. At each diffusion timestep, there is a different noise-to-data ratio and the timestep-dependent discriminator learns to distinguish the diffused real data from the diffused generated data. The generator learns from the discriminator's feedback by backpropagating through the forward diffusion chain, whose length is adaptively adjusted to balance the noise and data levels. We theoretically show that the discriminator's timestep-dependent strategy gives consistent and helpful guidance to the generator, enabling it to match the true data distribution. We demonstrate the advantages of Diffusion-GAN over strong GAN baselines on various datasets, showing that it can produce more realistic images with higher stability and data efficiency than state-of-the-art GANs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project homepage: https://github.com/Zhendong-Wang/Diffusion-GAN; ICLR 2023 camera ready version</p></details> |

They posses striking geometric properties that can be faithfully portrayed in low-dimensional settings. However, existing resources for explaining diffusion either require an advanced theoretical foundation or focus on their neural network architectures rather than their rich geometric properties. We introduce Diffusion Explorer, an interactive tool to explain the geometric properties of diffusion models. Users can train 2D diffusion models in the browser and observe the temporal dynamics of their sampling process. Diffusion Explorer leverages interactive animation, which has been shown to be a powerful tool for making engaging visualizations of dynamic systems, making it well suited to explaining diffusion models which represent stochastic processes that evolve over time. Diffusion Explorer is open source and a live demo is available at alechelbling.com/Diffusion-Explorer.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores diffusion models, a novel method for creating realistic synthetic speech. We create a diffusion dataset using available tools and pretrained models. Additionally, this study assesses the quality of diffusion-generated deepfakes versus non-diffusion ones and their potential threat to current deepfake detection systems. Findings indicate that the detection of diffusion-based deepfakes is generally comparable to non-diffusion deepfakes, with some variability based on detector architecture.

In contrast to previous work, functional diffusion works on samples that are represented by functions with a continuous domain. Functional diffusion can be seen as an extension of classical diffusion models to an infinite-dimensional domain. Functional diffusion is very versatile as images, videos, audio, 3D shapes, deformations, \etc, can be handled by the same framework with minimal changes. In addition, functional diffusion is especially suited for irregular data or data defined in non-standard domains. In our work, we derive the necessary foundations for functional diffusion and propose a first implementation based on the transformer architecture. We show generative results on complicated signed distance functions and deformation functions defined on 3D surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the project site, see https://1zb.github.io/functional-diffusion/</p></details> |
| **[Where to Diffuse, How to Diffuse, and How to Get Back: Automated Learning for Multivariate Diffusions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07261v2)** | 2023-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models (DBGMs) perturb data to a target noise distribution and reverse this process to generate samples. The choice of noising process, or inference diffusion process, affects both likelihoods and sample quality. For example, extending the inference process with auxiliary variables leads to improved sample quality. While there are many such multivariate diffusions to explore, each new one requires significant model-specific analysis, hindering rapid prototyping and evaluation. In this work, we study Multivariate Diffusion Models (MDMs). For any number of auxiliary variables, we provide a recipe for maximizing a lower-bound on the MDMs likelihood without requiring any model-specific analysis. We then demonstrate how to parameterize the diffusion for a specified target noise distribution; these two points together enable optimizing the inference diffusion process. Optimizing the diffusion expands easy experimentation from just a few well-known processes to an automatic search over all linear diffusions. To demonstrate these ideas, we introduce two new specific diffusions as well as learn a diffusion process on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet32 datasets. We show learned MDMs match or surpass bits-per-dims (BPDs) relative to fixed choices of diffusions for a given dataset and model architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Immiscible Diffusion: Accelerating Diffusion Training with Noise Assignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12303v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we point out that suboptimal noise-data mapping leads to slow training of diffusion models. During diffusion training, current methods diffuse each image across the entire noise space, resulting in a mixture of all images at every point in the noise layer. We emphasize that this random mixture of noise-data mapping complicates the optimization of the denoising function in diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the immiscibility phenomenon in physics, we propose Immiscible Diffusion, a simple and effective method to improve the random mixture of noise-data mapping. In physics, miscibility can vary according to various intermolecular forces. Thus, immiscibility means that the mixing of molecular sources is distinguishable. Inspired by this concept, we propose an assignment-then-diffusion training strategy to achieve Immiscible Diffusion. As one example, prior to diffusing the image data into noise, we assign diffusion target noise for the image data by minimizing the total image-noise pair distance in a mini-batch. The assignment functions analogously to external forces to expel the diffuse-able areas of images, thus mitigating the inherent difficulties in diffusion training. Our approach is remarkably simple, requiring only one line of code to restrict the diffuse-able area for each image while preserving the Gaussian distribution of noise. In this way, each image is preferably projected to nearby noise. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve up to 3x faster training for unconditional Consistency Models on the CIFAR dataset, as well as for DDIM and Stable Diffusion on CelebA and ImageNet dataset, and in class-conditional training and fine-tuning. In addition, we conducted a thorough analysis that sheds light on how it improves diffusion training speed while improving fidelity.

| **[Guided Diffusion from Self-Supervised Diffusion Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08825v1)** | 2023-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guidance serves as a key concept in diffusion models, yet its effectiveness is often limited by the need for extra data annotation or classifier pretraining. That is why guidance was harnessed from self-supervised learning backbones, like DINO. However, recent studies have revealed that the feature representation derived from diffusion model itself is discriminative for numerous downstream tasks as well, which prompts us to propose a framework to extract guidance from, and specifically for, diffusion models. Our research has yielded several significant contributions. Firstly, the guidance signals from diffusion models are on par with those from class-conditioned diffusion models. Secondly, feature regularization, when based on the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, can further enhance feature discriminability in comparison to unconditional diffusion models. Thirdly, we have constructed an online training approach that can concurrently derive guidance from diffusion models for diffusion models. Lastly, we have extended the application of diffusion models along the constant velocity path of ODE to achieve a more favorable balance between sampling steps and fidelity. The performance of our methods has been outstanding, outperforming related baseline comparisons in large-resolution datasets, such as ImageNet256, ImageNet256-100 and LSUN-Churches. Our code will be released.</p></details> | Work In Progress |
| **[Q-Diffusion: Quantizing Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04304v3)** | 2023-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved great success in image synthesis through iterative noise estimation using deep neural networks. However, the slow inference, high memory consumption, and computation intensity of the noise estimation model hinder the efficient adoption of diffusion models. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) is considered a go-to compression method for other tasks, it does not work out-of-the-box on diffusion models. We propose a novel PTQ method specifically tailored towards the unique multi-timestep pipeline and model architecture of the diffusion models, which compresses the noise estimation network to accelerate the generation process. We identify the key difficulty of diffusion model quantization as the changing output distributions of noise estimation networks over multiple time steps and the bimodal activation distribution of the shortcut layers within the noise estimation network. We tackle these challenges with timestep-aware calibration and split shortcut quantization in this work. Experimental results show that our proposed method is able to quantize full-precision unconditional diffusion models into 4-bit while maintaining comparable performance (small FID change of at most 2.34 compared to >100 for traditional PTQ) in a training-free manner. Our approach can also be applied to text-guided image generation, where we can run stable diffusion in 4-bit weights with high generation quality for the first time.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/Xiuyu-Li/q-diffusion</p></details> |
| **[Beta Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07867v4)** | 2023-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce beta diffusion, a novel generative modeling method that integrates demasking and denoising to generate data within bounded ranges. Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time. Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs, which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization. Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models, thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2023 |

However, the intrinsic mutual interference among image regions contradicts the need for practical downstream application scenarios where the preservation of low-level pixel information from given conditioning is desired (e.g., customization tasks like personalized generation and inpainting based on a user-provided single image). In this work, we investigate the diffusion (physics) in diffusion (machine learning) properties and propose our Cyclic One-Way Diffusion (COW) method to control the direction of diffusion phenomenon given a pre-trained frozen diffusion model for versatile customization application scenarios, where the low-level pixel information from the conditioning needs to be preserved. Notably, unlike most current methods that incorporate additional conditions by fine-tuning the base text-to-image diffusion model or learning auxiliary networks, our method provides a novel perspective to understand the task needs and is applicable to a wider range of customization scenarios in a learning-free manner. Extensive experiment results show that our proposed COW can achieve more flexible customization based on strict visual conditions in different application settings.

| **[Dynamical Diffusion: Learning Temporal Dynamics with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00951v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks by progressively adding noise to data through a forward process and then reversing this process to generate realistic samples. While these models have achieved strong performance across various tasks and modalities, their application to temporal predictive learning remains underexplored. Existing approaches treat predictive learning as a conditional generation problem, but often fail to fully exploit the temporal dynamics inherent in the data, leading to challenges in generating temporally coherent sequences. To address this, we introduce Dynamical Diffusion (DyDiff), a theoretically sound framework that incorporates temporally aware forward and reverse processes. Dynamical Diffusion explicitly models temporal transitions at each diffusion step, establishing dependencies on preceding states to better capture temporal dynamics. Through the reparameterization trick, Dynamical Diffusion achieves efficient training and inference similar to any standard diffusion model. Extensive experiments across scientific spatiotemporal forecasting, video prediction, and time series forecasting demonstrate that Dynamical Diffusion consistently improves performance in temporal predictive tasks, filling a crucial gap in existing methodologies.

Here, we show that blurring can equivalently be defined through a Gaussian diffusion process with non-isotropic noise. In making this connection, we bridge the gap between inverse heat dissipation and denoising diffusion, and we shed light on the inductive bias that results from this modeling choice. Finally, we propose a generalized class of diffusion models that offers the best of both standard Gaussian denoising diffusion and inverse heat dissipation, which we call Blurring Diffusion Models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic Diffusion in ITK](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00992v1)** | 2015-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anisotropic Non-Linear Diffusion is a powerful image processing technique, which allows to simultaneously remove the noise and enhance sharp features in two or three dimensional images. Anisotropic Diffusion is understood here in the sense of Weickert, meaning that diffusion tensors are anisotropic and reflect the local orientation of image features. This is in contrast with the non-linear diffusion filter of Perona and Malik, which only involves scalar diffusion coefficients, in other words isotropic diffusion tensors. In this paper, we present an anisotropic non-linear diffusion technique we implemented in ITK. This technique is based on a recent adaptive scheme making the diffusion stable and requiring limited numerical resources. (See supplementary data.)</p></details> |  |

The main focus has been to understand the effects of the competitive dynamic market on the diffusion of innovation. The global smartphone operating system sales are chosen as an example. The availability of the sales and the number of users data, as well as the predictions for the future number of users, make the smartphone diffusion a new laboratory to test the innovation of diffusion models for the competitive markets. In this work, the Bass model and its extensions which incorporate the competition between the brands are used. The diffusion of smartphones can be considered on two levels: the product level and the brand level. The diffusion of the smartphone as a category is studied by using the Bass equation (category-level diffusion). The diffusion of each competing operating system (iOS and Android) are considered as the competition of the brands, and it is studied in the context of competitive market models (product-level diffusion). It is shown that the effects of personal interactions play the dominant role in the diffusion process. Moreover, the volume of near future sales can be predicted by introducing appropriate dynamic market potential which helps to extrapolate the model results for the future.</p></details> |  |

It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compressed Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00033v2)** | 2019-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion maps are a commonly used kernel-based method for manifold learning, which can reveal intrinsic structures in data and embed them in low dimensions. However, as with most kernel methods, its implementation requires a heavy computational load, reaching up to cubic complexity in the number of data points. This limits its usability in modern data analysis. Here, we present a new approach to computing the diffusion geometry, and related embeddings, from a compressed diffusion process between data regions rather than data points. Our construction is based on an adaptation of the previously proposed measure-based Gaussian correlation (MGC) kernel that robustly captures the local geometry around data points. We use this MGC kernel to efficiently compress diffusion relations from pointwise to data region resolution. Finally, a spectral embedding of the data regions provides coordinates that are used to interpolate and approximate the pointwise diffusion map embedding of data. We analyze theoretical connections between our construction and the original diffusion geometry of diffusion maps, and demonstrate the utility of our method in analyzing big datasets, where it outperforms competing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages double column, published in SampTA 2019</p></details> |

However, these methods usually do not consider the behavior of diffusion process. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step (sampling/estimation) measurement framework by utilizing the diffusion process characteristics. To this end, we propose a link-tracing based sampling design which uses the infection times as local information without any knowledge about the latent structure of diffusion network. To correct the bias of sampled data, we introduce three estimators for different categories; link-based, node-based, and cascade-based. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce a complete measurement framework for diffusion networks. We also show that the estimator plays an important role in correcting the bias of sampling from diffusion networks. Our comprehensive empirical analysis over large synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that in average, the proposed framework outperforms the common BFS and RW sampling methods in terms of link-based characteristics by about 37% and 35%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Published in: International Confernece on Social Computing 2012 (SocialCom12)</p></details> |
| **[Planned Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18087v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller, independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

In this work, we propose a lightweight image captioning network in combination with continuous diffusion, called Prefix-diffusion. To achieve diversity, we design an efficient method that injects prefix image embeddings into the denoising process of the diffusion model. In order to reduce trainable parameters, we employ a pre-trained model to extract image features and further design an extra mapping network. Prefix-diffusion is able to generate diverse captions with relatively less parameters, while maintaining the fluency and relevance of the captions benefiting from the generative capabilities of the diffusion model. Our work paves the way for scaling up diffusion models for image captioning, and achieves promising performance compared with recent approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages,4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting.

However, existing reconstruction methods based on diffusion models are primarily formulated in the image domain, making the reconstruction quality susceptible to inaccuracies in coil sensitivity maps (CSMs). k-space interpolation methods can effectively address this issue but conventional diffusion models are not readily applicable in k-space interpolation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel approach called SPIRiT-Diffusion, which is a diffusion model for k-space interpolation inspired by the iterative self-consistent SPIRiT method. Specifically, we utilize the iterative solver of the self-consistent term (i.e., k-space physical prior) in SPIRiT to formulate a novel stochastic differential equation (SDE) governing the diffusion process. Subsequently, k-space data can be interpolated by executing the diffusion process. This innovative approach highlights the optimization model's role in designing the SDE in diffusion models, enabling the diffusion process to align closely with the physics inherent in the optimization model, a concept referred to as model-driven diffusion.

| **[Smooth Diffusion: Crafting Smooth Latent Spaces in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04410v1)** | 2023-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have made remarkable progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation, synthesizing images with high fidelity and diverse contents. Despite this advancement, latent space smoothness within diffusion models remains largely unexplored. Smooth latent spaces ensure that a perturbation on an input latent corresponds to a steady change in the output image. This property proves beneficial in downstream tasks, including image interpolation, inversion, and editing. In this work, we expose the non-smoothness of diffusion latent spaces by observing noticeable visual fluctuations resulting from minor latent variations. To tackle this issue, we propose Smooth Diffusion, a new category of diffusion models that can be simultaneously high-performing and smooth. Specifically, we introduce Step-wise Variation Regularization to enforce the proportion between the variations of an arbitrary input latent and that of the output image is a constant at any diffusion training step. In addition, we devise an interpolation standard deviation (ISTD) metric to effectively assess the latent space smoothness of a diffusion model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion stands out as a more desirable solution not only in T2I generation but also across various downstream tasks. Smooth Diffusion is implemented as a plug-and-play Smooth-LoRA to work with various community models.

| **[Unifying Continuous and Discrete Text Diffusion with Non-simultaneous Diffusion Processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22165v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation, with recent works falling into two main categories: discrete and continuous diffusion models. Discrete diffusion models apply token corruption independently using categorical distributions, allowing for different diffusion progress across tokens but lacking fine-grained control. Continuous diffusion models map tokens to continuous spaces and apply fine-grained noise, but the diffusion progress is uniform across tokens, limiting their ability to capture semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\underline{N}}on-simultan\textbf{\underline{e}}ous C\textbf{\underline{o}}ntinuous \textbf{\underline{Diff}}usion Models (NeoDiff), a novel diffusion model that integrates the strengths of both discrete and continuous approaches. NeoDiff introduces a Poisson diffusion process for the forward process, enabling a flexible and fine-grained noising paradigm, and employs a time predictor for the reverse process to adaptively modulate the denoising progress based on token semantics. Furthermore, NeoDiff utilizes an optimized schedule for inference to ensure more precise noise control and improved performance. Our approach unifies the theories of discrete and continuous diffusion models, offering a more principled and effective framework for text generation. Experimental results on several text generation tasks demonstrate NeoDiff's superior performance compared to baselines of non-autoregressive continuous and discrete diffusion models, iterative-based methods and autoregressive diffusion-based methods. These results highlight NeoDiff's potential as a powerful tool for generating high-quality text and advancing the field of diffusion-based text generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

In this work, we propose Diffusion-of-Thought (DoT), a novel approach that integrates diffusion models with Chain-of-Thought, a well-established technique for improving the reasoning ability of autoregressive language models. In contrast to autoregressive language models that make decisions in a left-to-right, token-by-token manner, DoT allows reasoning steps to diffuse over time through a diffusion language model and offers greater flexibility in trading-off computation for reasoning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DoT in multi-digit multiplication, boolean logic, and grade school math problems, with a small diffusion model outperforming a much larger autoregressive model in both efficiency and accuracy. In addition to that, DoT showcases promising self-correction abilities and benefits from existing reasoning-enhancing techniques like self-consistency decoding. Our findings contribute to the understanding and development of reasoning with diffusion language models.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Diffusion Tuning: Transferring Diffusion Models via Chain of Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00773v2)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of generative modeling. However, training a diffusion model is computationally expensive, creating a pressing need to adapt off-the-shelf diffusion models for downstream generation tasks. Current fine-tuning methods focus on parameter-efficient transfer learning but overlook the fundamental transfer characteristics of diffusion models. In this paper, we investigate the transferability of diffusion models and observe a monotonous chain of forgetting trend of transferability along the reverse process. Based on this observation and novel theoretical insights, we present Diff-Tuning, a frustratingly simple transfer approach that leverages the chain of forgetting tendency. Diff-Tuning encourages the fine-tuned model to retain the pre-trained knowledge at the end of the denoising chain close to the generated data while discarding the other noise side. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate Diff-Tuning, including the transfer of pre-trained Diffusion Transformer models to eight downstream generations and the adaptation of Stable Diffusion to five control conditions with ControlNet. Diff-Tuning achieves a 26% improvement over standard fine-tuning and enhances the convergence speed of ControlNet by 24%. Notably, parameter-efficient transfer learning techniques for diffusion models can also benefit from Diff-Tuning.</p></details> |  |

We develop Diffusion Boosted Trees (DBT), which can be viewed as both a new denoising diffusion generative model parameterized by decision trees (one single tree for each diffusion timestep), and a new boosting algorithm that combines the weak learners into a strong learner of conditional distributions without making explicit parametric assumptions on their density forms. We demonstrate through experiments the advantages of DBT over deep neural network-based diffusion models as well as the competence of DBT on real-world regression tasks, and present a business application (fraud detection) of DBT for classification on tabular data with the ability of learning to defer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04137v5)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Diffusion Policy, a new way of generating robot behavior by representing a robot's visuomotor policy as a conditional denoising diffusion process. We benchmark Diffusion Policy across 12 different tasks from 4 different robot manipulation benchmarks and find that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art robot learning methods with an average improvement of 46.9%. Diffusion Policy learns the gradient of the action-distribution score function and iteratively optimizes with respect to this gradient field during inference via a series of stochastic Langevin dynamics steps. We find that the diffusion formulation yields powerful advantages when used for robot policies, including gracefully handling multimodal action distributions, being suitable for high-dimensional action spaces, and exhibiting impressive training stability. To fully unlock the potential of diffusion models for visuomotor policy learning on physical robots, this paper presents a set of key technical contributions including the incorporation of receding horizon control, visual conditioning, and the time-series diffusion transformer. We hope this work will help motivate a new generation of policy learning techniques that are able to leverage the powerful generative modeling capabilities of diffusion models.

However, applying diffusion to discrete categorical data remains a non-trivial task. Moreover, generation in continuous domains often requires clipping in practice, which motivates the need for a theoretical framework for adapting diffusion to constrained domains. Inspired by the mirror Langevin algorithm for the constrained sampling problem, in this theoretical report we propose Mirror Diffusion Models (MDMs). We demonstrate MDMs in the context of simplex diffusion and propose natural extensions to popular domains such as image and text generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Masking Diffusion Works: Condition on the Jump Schedule for Improved Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08316v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models, like continuous diffusion models, generate high-quality samples by gradually undoing noise applied to datapoints with a Markov process. Gradual generation in theory comes with many conceptual benefits; for example, inductive biases can be incorporated into the noising Markov process, and access to improved sampling algorithms. In practice, however, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is, surprisingly, masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we explain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes use of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov processes: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed rate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in the known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to. We show that we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any discrete diffusion model. The resulting models - schedule-conditioned discrete diffusion (SCUD) - generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking diffusion. By applying SCUD to models with noising processes that incorporate inductive biases on images, text, and protein data, we build models that outperform masking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Neurips 2025.

| **[Block Diffusion: Interpolating Between Autoregressive and Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09573v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences.

| **[Diffusion-DICE: In-Sample Diffusion Guidance for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20109v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One important property of DIstribution Correction Estimation (DICE) methods is that the solution is the optimal stationary distribution ratio between the optimized and data collection policy. In this work, we show that DICE-based methods can be viewed as a transformation from the behavior distribution to the optimal policy distribution. Based on this, we propose a novel approach, Diffusion-DICE, that directly performs this transformation using diffusion models. We find that the optimal policy's score function can be decomposed into two terms: the behavior policy's score function and the gradient of a guidance term which depends on the optimal distribution ratio. The first term can be obtained from a diffusion model trained on the dataset and we propose an in-sample learning objective to learn the second term. Due to the multi-modality contained in the optimal policy distribution, the transformation in Diffusion-DICE may guide towards those local-optimal modes. We thus generate a few candidate actions and carefully select from them to approach global-optimum. Different from all other diffusion-based offline RL methods, the guide-then-select paradigm in Diffusion-DICE only uses in-sample actions for training and brings minimal error exploitation in the value function. We use a didatic toycase example to show how previous diffusion-based methods fail to generate optimal actions due to leveraging these errors and how Diffusion-DICE successfully avoids that. We then conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to show the strong performance of Diffusion-DICE.

| **[Intellectual Property Protection of Diffusion Models via the Watermark Diffusion Process](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03436v2)** | 2023-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have rapidly become a vital part of deep generative architectures, given today's increasing demands. Obtaining large, high-performance diffusion models demands significant resources, highlighting their importance as intellectual property worth protecting. However, existing watermarking techniques for ownership verification are insufficient when applied to diffusion models. Very recent research in watermarking diffusion models either exposes watermarks during task generation, which harms the imperceptibility, or is developed for conditional diffusion models that require prompts to trigger the watermark. This paper introduces WDM, a novel watermarking solution for diffusion models without imprinting the watermark during task generation. It involves training a model to concurrently learn a Watermark Diffusion Process (WDP) for embedding watermarks alongside the standard diffusion process for task generation. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of WDP training and sampling, relating it to a shifted Gaussian diffusion process via the same reverse noise. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in various trigger and watermark data configurations.</p></details> |  |

Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score (CRPS).</p></details> |  |

Yet, integrating preference learning into Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models is still relatively uncharted territory. The Diffusion-DPO technique made initial strides by employing pairwise preference learning in diffusion models tailored for specific text prompts. We introduce Diffusion-RPO, a new method designed to align diffusion-based T2I models with human preferences more effectively. This approach leverages both prompt-image pairs with identical prompts and those with semantically related content across various modalities. Furthermore, we have developed a new evaluation metric, style alignment, aimed at overcoming the challenges of high costs, low reproducibility, and limited interpretability prevalent in current evaluations of human preference alignment. Our findings demonstrate that Diffusion-RPO outperforms established methods such as Supervised Fine-Tuning and Diffusion-DPO in tuning Stable Diffusion versions 1.5 and XL-1.0, achieving superior results in both automated evaluations of human preferences and style alignment.

Despite being performant, these models lack the ability to revise existing text, which limits their usability in many practical scenarios. We look to address this, with DiffusER (Diffusion via Edit-based Reconstruction), a new edit-based generative model for text based on denoising diffusion models -- a class of models that use a Markov chain of denoising steps to incrementally generate data. DiffusER is not only a strong generative model in general, rivalling autoregressive models on several tasks spanning machine translation, summarization, and style transfer; it can also perform other varieties of generation that standard autoregressive models are not well-suited for. For instance, we demonstrate that DiffusER makes it possible for a user to condition generation on a prototype, or an incomplete sequence, and continue revising based on previous edit steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Rolling Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09470v3)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently been increasingly applied to temporal data such as video, fluid mechanics simulations, or climate data. These methods generally treat subsequent frames equally regarding the amount of noise in the diffusion process. This paper explores Rolling Diffusion: a new approach that uses a sliding window denoising process. It ensures that the diffusion process progressively corrupts through time by assigning more noise to frames that appear later in a sequence, reflecting greater uncertainty about the future as the generation process unfolds. Empirically, we show that when the temporal dynamics are complex, Rolling Diffusion is superior to standard diffusion. In particular, this result is demonstrated in a video prediction task using the Kinetics-600 video dataset and in a chaotic fluid dynamics forecasting experiment.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-Diffusion: Auto-Regressive Diffusion Model for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09515v3)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have gained significant attention in the realm of image generation due to their exceptional performance. Their success has been recently expanded to text generation via generating all tokens within a sequence concurrently. However, natural language exhibits a far more pronounced sequential dependency in comparison to images, and the majority of existing language models are trained with a left-to-right auto-regressive approach. To account for the inherent sequential characteristic of natural language, we introduce Auto-Regressive Diffusion (AR-Diffusion). AR-Diffusion ensures that the generation of tokens on the right depends on the generated ones on the left, a mechanism achieved through employing a dynamic number of denoising steps that vary based on token position. This results in tokens on the left undergoing fewer denoising steps than those on the right, thereby enabling them to generate earlier and subsequently influence the generation of tokens on the right. In a series of experiments on various text generation tasks, including text summarization, machine translation, and common sense generation, AR-Diffusion clearly demonstrated its superiority over existing diffusion language models and that it can be $100\times\sim600\times$ faster when achieving comparable results.

However, real world data often takes place in discrete-state spaces, including many scientific applications. Here, we develop a theoretical formulation for arbitrary discrete-state Markov processes in the forward diffusion process using exact (as opposed to variational) analysis. We relate the theory to the existing continuous-state Gaussian diffusion as well as other approaches to discrete diffusion, and identify the corresponding reverse-time stochastic process and score function in the continuous-time setting, and the reverse-time mapping in the discrete-time setting. As an example of this framework, we introduce ``Blackout Diffusion'', which learns to produce samples from an empty image instead of from noise. Numerical experiments on the CIFAR-10, Binarized MNIST, and CelebA datasets confirm the feasibility of our approach. Generalizing from specific (Gaussian) forward processes to discrete-state processes without a variational approximation sheds light on how to interpret diffusion models, which we discuss.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables.
