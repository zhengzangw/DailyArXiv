| **[CompSlider: Compositional Slider for Disentangled Multiple-Attribute Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01028v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes, preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach, CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lost in Latent Space: An Empirical Study of Latent Diffusion Models for Physics Emulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02608v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation via Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01362v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a 1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025 Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and strong generality. The code is available at https://github.com/Andyplus1/IPT2V.git.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Communicative Agents for Slideshow Storytelling Video Generation based on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01277v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models are typically constrained by high computational costs. In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design. These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos. By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%. Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and customization. The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a pioneering system for next-generation content creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[MSC: A Marine Wildlife Video Dataset with Grounded Segmentation and Clip-Level Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04549v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion, and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at https://msc.hkustvgd.com.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ACMMM2025 (Dataset track)</p></details> |
| **[FantasyHSI: Video-Generation-Centric 4D Human Synthesis In Any Scene through A Graph-based Multi-Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01232v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions. Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator, significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding. Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism.

| **[Preacher: Paper-to-Video Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09632v5)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible, well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a topdown approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation models.

| **[Accelerating Diffusion Sampling via Exploiting Local Transition Coherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09675v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in generating high-quality images and videos from textual descriptions. However, the lengthy sampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in practical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical relationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity between them, which often only works with specific network structures. To address this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the transition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the outputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on the network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel training-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified relationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent steps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure, LTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to almost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with them. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up sampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining competitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of 1.67-fold in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55-fold in video generation models. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable 10-fold speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than 16FPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAGE: A Stream-Centric Generative World Model for Long-Horizon Driving-Scene Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13138v3)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of temporally consistent, high-fidelity driving videos over extended horizons presents a fundamental challenge in autonomous driving world modeling. Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[VPO: Aligning Text-to-Video Generation Models with Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20491v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video tasks. These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly detailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs during inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes prompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods often rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context learning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent, omit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize prompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can lead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a principled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles: harmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully preserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of generated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization approach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset based on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both text-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with preference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO significantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to baseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video generation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be combined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the effectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/VPO.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[DevilSight: Augmenting Monocular Human Avatar Reconstruction through a Virtual Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00403v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges, we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuaDreamer: Controllable Panoramic Video Generation for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02512v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

| **[Mixture of Contexts for Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21058v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://primecai.github.io/moc/</p></details> |
| **[POSE: Phased One-Step Adversarial Equilibrium for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21019v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences. Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models. To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii) conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment, temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pose-paper.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIDAS: Multimodal Interactive Digital-humAn Synthesis via Real-time Autoregressive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19320v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, interactive digital human video generation has attracted widespread attention and achieved remarkable progress. However, building such a practical system that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains challenging to existing methods, which often struggle with heavy computational cost and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal control and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal modifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts multimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs spatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising process of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale dialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing rich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep compression autoencoder with up to 64$\times$ reduction ratio, which effectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive model. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human synthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach in low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/showlab/Ego-PM</p></details> |
| **[Realistic and Controllable 3D Gaussian-Guided Object Editing for Driving Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20471v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous. Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects. Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Puppet-Master: Scaling Interactive Video Generation as a Motion Prior for Part-Level Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04631v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Puppet-Master, an interactive video generator that captures the internal, part-level motion of objects, serving as a proxy for modeling object dynamics universally. Given an image of an object and a set of "drags" specifying the trajectory of a few points on the object, the model synthesizes a video where the object's parts move accordingly. To build Puppet-Master, we extend a pre-trained image-to-video generator to encode the input drags. We also propose all-to-first attention, an alternative to conventional spatial attention that mitigates artifacts caused by fine-tuning a video generator on out-of-domain data. The model is fine-tuned on Objaverse-Animation-HQ, a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips obtained by rendering synthetic 3D animations. Unlike real videos, these synthetic clips avoid confounding part-level motion with overall object and camera motion. We extensively filter sub-optimal animations and augment the synthetic renderings with meaningful drags that emphasize the internal dynamics of objects. We demonstrate that Puppet-Master learns to generate part-level motions, unlike other motion-conditioned video generators that primarily move the object as a whole. Moreover, Puppet-Master generalizes well to out-of-domain real images, outperforming existing methods on real-world benchmarks in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

| **[Unlearning Concepts from Text-to-Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14209v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of computer vision and natural language processing, text-to-video generation, enabled by text-to-video diffusion models, has become more prevalent. These models are trained using a large amount of data from the internet. However, the training data often contain copyrighted content, including cartoon character icons and artist styles, private portraits, and unsafe videos. Since filtering the data and retraining the model is challenging, methods for unlearning specific concepts from text-to-video diffusion models have been investigated. However, due to the high computational complexity and relative large optimization scale, there is little work on unlearning methods for text-to-video diffusion models. We propose a novel concept-unlearning method by transferring the unlearning capability of the text encoder of text-to-image diffusion models to text-to-video diffusion models. Specifically, the method optimizes the text encoder using few-shot unlearning, where several generated images are used. We then use the optimized text encoder in text-to-video diffusion models to generate videos. Our method costs low computation resources and has small optimization scale. We discuss the generated videos after unlearning a concept. The experiments demonstrates that our method can unlearn copyrighted cartoon characters, artist styles, objects and people's facial characteristics. Our method can unlearn a concept within about 100 seconds on an RTX 3070. Since there was no concept unlearning method for text-to-video diffusion models before, we make concept unlearning feasible and more accessible in the text-to-video domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[FaceEditTalker: Controllable Talking Head Generation with Facial Attribute Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22141v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in audio-driven talking head generation have achieved impressive results in lip synchronization and emotional expression. However, they largely overlook the crucial task of facial attribute editing. This capability is indispensable for achieving deep personalization and expanding the range of practical applications, including user-tailored digital avatars, engaging online education content, and brand-specific digital customer service. In these key domains, flexible adjustment of visual attributes, such as hairstyle, accessories, and subtle facial features, is essential for aligning with user preferences, reflecting diverse brand identities and adapting to varying contextual demands. In this paper, we present FaceEditTalker, a unified framework that enables controllable facial attribute manipulation while generating high-quality, audio-synchronized talking head videos. Our method consists of two key components: an image feature space editing module, which extracts semantic and detail features and allows flexible control over attributes like expression, hairstyle, and accessories; and an audio-driven video generation module, which fuses these edited features with audio-guided facial landmarks to drive a diffusion-based generator. This design ensures temporal coherence, visual fidelity, and identity preservation across frames. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to representative baseline methods in lip-sync accuracy, video quality, and attribute controllability.

| **[ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model. Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline fidelity while significantly improving efficiency.

However, most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details, such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V), image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single, integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably, it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions. We hope this technical report will help the community more efficiently train high-quality video generation models and accelerate progress in video generation technologies.

| **[Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09822v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

However, when addressing the side effects of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision. This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes, objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

However, they often fall short in more complex film and television productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan. Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions. Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.</p></details> |  |

However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the impact of lighting is deeply coupled with other factors of videos, e.g., objects and scenes. Thus, it remains challenging to disentangle and model coherent lighting conditions independently, limiting the flexibility to control lighting in video generation. In this paper, inspired by the established controllable T2I models, we propose LumiSculpt, which enables precise and consistent lighting control in T2V generation models. LumiSculpt equips the video generation with new interactive capabilities, allowing the input of reference image sequences with customized lighting conditions. Furthermore, the core learnable plug-and-play module of LumiSculpt facilitates direct control over the intensity, position and trajectory of an assumed light source in video diffusion models. To effectively train LumiSculpt and address the issue of insufficient lighting data, we construct LumiHuman, a new lightweight and flexible dataset for portrait lighting of images and videos. Experimental results demonstrate that LumiSculpt achieves precise and high-quality lighting control in video generation. The analysis demonstrates the flexibility of LumiHuman.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

The practical and economic barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2 world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset, blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1 mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoCo: Motion-Consistent Human Video Generation via Structure-Appearance Decoupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17404v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion. Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos, limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic and structurally coherent human videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://hywang2002.github.io/MoCo</p></details> |
| **[DiCache: Let Diffusion Model Determine Its Own Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17356v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image generation.</p></details> |  |

However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control and overall consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiCache: Training-free Acceleration of Diffusion Models via Hermite Polynomial-based Feature Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16984v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

To address key challenges in video-to-audio generation, including multimodal data scarcity, modality imbalance and limited audio quality in existing methods, we propose HunyuanVideo-Foley, an end-to-end text-video-to-audio framework that synthesizes high-fidelity audio precisely aligned with visual dynamics and semantic context. Our approach incorporates three core innovations: (1) a scalable data pipeline curating 100k-hour multimodal datasets through automated annotation; (2) a representation alignment strategy using self-supervised audio features to guide latent diffusion training, efficiently improving audio quality and generation stability; (3) a novel multimodal diffusion transformer resolving modal competition, containing dual-stream audio-video fusion through joint attention, and textual semantic injection via cross-attention. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HunyuanVideo-Foley achieves new state-of-the-art performance across audio fidelity, visual-semantic alignment, temporal alignment and distribution matching.

| **[Seeing Clearly, Forgetting Deeply: Revisiting Fine-Tuned Video Generators for Driving Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16512v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecast then Calibrate: Feature Caching as ODE for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16211v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps. However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE. We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world applications, users are often presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity (binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~group-inference, GitHub: https://github.com/GaParmar/group-inference</p></details> |

Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning, and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create 360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a \textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation, respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model} based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.

Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and improving the fidelity of generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://johanan528.github.io/worldweaver_web/</p></details> |
| **[Capturing Stable HDR Videos Using a Dual-Camera System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06593v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High Dynamic Range (HDR) video acquisition using the alternating exposure (AE) paradigm has garnered significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness with a single consumer camera. However, despite progress driven by deep neural networks, these methods remain prone to temporal flicker in real-world applications due to inter-frame exposure inconsistencies. To address this challenge while maintaining the cost-effectiveness of the AE paradigm, we propose a novel learning-based HDR video generation solution. Specifically, we propose a dual-stream HDR video generation paradigm that decouples temporal luminance anchoring from exposure-variant detail reconstruction, overcoming the inherent limitations of the AE paradigm. To support this, we design an asynchronous dual-camera system (DCS), which enables independent exposure control across two cameras, eliminating the need for synchronization typically required in traditional multi-camera setups. Furthermore, an exposure-adaptive fusion network (EAFNet) is formulated for the DCS system. EAFNet integrates a pre-alignment subnetwork that aligns features across varying exposures, ensuring robust feature extraction for subsequent fusion, an asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork that emphasizes reference-based attention to effectively merge these features across exposures, and a reconstruction subnetwork to mitigate ghosting artifacts and preserve fine details. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, showing the remarkable potential of our solution in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured by DCS will be available at https://zqqqyu.github.io/DCS-HDR/.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods lack spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem, we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table. Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline.

This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, project page: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/OmniVideo_project/</p></details> |

However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first three authors.

To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored to individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as SOTA VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive human annotations to ensure evaluation alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors.

To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video Generation Agent</p></details> |

As video length increases, issues such as visual degradation, loss of identity consistency, temporal incoherence, and error accumulation become increasingly prominent, severely impacting the realism and reliability of generated results. To address these issues, we present LetsTalk, a diffusion transformer framework that incorporates multimodal guidance and a novel memory bank mechanism, explicitly maintaining contextual continuity and enabling robust, high-quality, and efficient long-duration talking video generation. Specifically, LetsTalk introduces a memory bank combined with a noise-regularized training strategy to mitigate error accumulation and sampling artifacts during long video generation. To further enhance efficiency and spatiotemporal consistency, LetsTalk employs a deep compression autoencoder and a spatiotemporal-aware transformer with linear attention for effective multimodal fusion. Furthermore, we systematically analyze three multimodal fusion schemes, adopting deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait features to ensure visual consistency, and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio to synchronize animation with speech while preserving motion diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LetsTalk achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic talking videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, while maintaining remarkable efficiency with 8 fewer parameters than previous approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |
| **[MinD: Learning A Dual-System World Model for Real-Time Planning and Implicit Risk Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18897v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Generation Models (VGMs) have become powerful backbones for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging large-scale pretraining for robust dynamics modeling. However, current methods underutilize their distribution modeling capabilities for predicting future states. Two challenges hinder progress: integrating generative processes into feature learning is both technically and conceptually underdeveloped, and naive frame-by-frame video diffusion is computationally inefficient for real-time robotics. To address these, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a dual-system world model for real-time, risk-aware planning. MinD uses two asynchronous diffusion processes: a low-frequency visual generator (LoDiff) that predicts future scenes and a high-frequency diffusion policy (HiDiff) that outputs actions. Our key insight is that robotic policies do not require fully denoised frames but can rely on low-resolution latents generated in a single denoising step. To connect early predictions to actions, we introduce DiffMatcher, a video-action alignment module with a novel co-training strategy that synchronizes the two diffusion models. MinD achieves a 63% success rate on RL-Bench, 60% on real-world Franka tasks, and operates at 11.3 FPS, demonstrating the efficiency of single-step latent features for control signals. Furthermore, MinD identifies 74% of potential task failures in advance, providing real-time safety signals for monitoring and intervention. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient and reliable robotic manipulation using generative world models.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided, subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced DreamSwapV-Benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoVieDrive: Multi-Modal Multi-View Urban Scene Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14327v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality.

Meanwhile, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image and video generation, making them attractive for network optimization tasks. In this paper, we propose xDiff, a diffusion-based reinforcement learning(RL) framework for inter-cell interference management (ICIM) in O-RAN. We first formulate ICIM as a resource allocation optimization problem aimed at maximizing a user-defined reward function and then develop an online learning solution by integrating a diffusion model into an RL framework for near-real-time policy generation. Particularly, we introduce a novel metric, preference values, as the policy representation to enable efficient policy-guided resource allocation within O-RAN distributed units (DUs). We implement xDiff on a 5G testbed consisting of three cells and a set of smartphones in two small-cell scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that xDiff outperforms state-of-the-art ICIM approaches, highlighting the potential of diffusion models for online optimization of O-RAN.

However, conventional video dubbing techniques remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Geo4D predicts several complementary geometric modalities, namely point, disparity, and ray maps.

Moreover, the widespread use of plastic wrapping has motivated researchers to investigate eco-friendly alternatives that still adhere to safety standards. We present a fully controllable and accurate physical simulation system capable of replicating the behavior of moving pallets. It features a 3D graphics-based virtual environment that supports a wide range of configurations, including variable package layouts, different wrapping materials, and diverse dynamic conditions. This innovative approach reduces the need for physical testing, cutting costs and environmental impact while improving measurement accuracy for analyzing pallet dynamics.

| **[Upsample What Matters: Region-Adaptive Latent Sampling for Accelerated Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08422v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.</p></details> |  |

Action-driven video generation faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions (HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of cross-domain dynamics.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint egocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key challenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated video must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion; 2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the observed visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these challenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built on the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a head-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head joint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that explicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within attention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale real-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel metrics to assess video-motion consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the EgoTwin framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing interactive world models depend on bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step auto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) A scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to effectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with diverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables frame-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step distillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video generation.

Current approaches, such as factorized attention and fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern, cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

During translation, it is essential to preserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate consistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen, an end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video generative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the control of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified paired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we construct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic videos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the community, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in diverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting simulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the aforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively unleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in synthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos. To implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple the learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from the perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into cinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground preservation.

However, through an empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks, effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and other advanced guidance strategies.

However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless, existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies, struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference efficiency compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

These interactions are essential for emerging biometric authentication systems, which rely on interactive motion-based anti-spoofing approaches. From a security perspective, there is a growing need for large-scale, high-quality interactive videos to train and strengthen authentication models. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for animating realistic hand-face interactions. Our approach simultaneously learns spatio-temporal contact dynamics and biomechanically plausible deformation effects, enabling natural interactions where hand movements induce anatomically accurate facial deformations while maintaining collision-free contact. To facilitate this research, we present InterHF, a large-scale hand-face interaction dataset featuring 18 interaction patterns and 90,000 annotated videos. Additionally, we propose InterAnimate, a region-aware diffusion model designed specifically for interaction animation. InterAnimate leverages learnable spatial and temporal latents to effectively capture dynamic interaction priors and integrates a region-aware interaction mechanism that injects these priors into the denoising process. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first large-scale effort to systematically study human hand-face interactions. Qualitative and quantitative results show InterAnimate produces highly realistic animations, setting a new benchmark.

Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality. Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR) video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.</p></details> |  |

Even with scaled-up models and massive datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable, largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing baselines across all criteria.</p></details> | 27 pages, 20 figures |
| **[FancyVideo: Towards Dynamic and Consistent Video Generation via Cross-frame Textual Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08189v4)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing motion-rich and temporally consistent videos remains a challenge in artificial intelligence, especially when dealing with extended durations. Existing text-to-video (T2V) models commonly employ spatial cross-attention for text control, equivalently guiding different frame generations without frame-specific textual guidance. Thus, the model's capacity to comprehend the temporal logic conveyed in prompts and generate videos with coherent motion is restricted. To tackle this limitation, we introduce FancyVideo, an innovative video generator that improves the existing text-control mechanism with the well-designed Cross-frame Textual Guidance Module (CTGM). Specifically, CTGM incorporates the Temporal Information Injector (TII) and Temporal Affinity Refiner (TAR) at the beginning and end of cross-attention, respectively, to achieve frame-specific textual guidance. Firstly, TII injects frame-specific information from latent features into text conditions, thereby obtaining cross-frame textual conditions. Then, TAR refines the correlation matrix between cross-frame textual conditions and latent features along the time dimension. Extensive experiments comprising both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FancyVideo. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art T2V generation results on the EvalCrafter benchmark and facilitates the synthesis of dynamic and consistent videos. Note that the T2V process of FancyVideo essentially involves a text-to-image step followed by T+I2V. This means it also supports the generation of videos from user images, i.e., the image-to-video (I2V) task. A significant number of experiments have shown that its performance is also outstanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Despite their importance, such dialogue scenes remain largely underexplored in video generation research. The main challenges include maintaining character consistency across different shots, creating a sense of spatial continuity, and generating long, multi-turn dialogues within limited computational budgets. Here, we present ShoulderShot, a framework that combines dual-shot generation with looping video, enabling extended dialogues while preserving character consistency. Our results demonstrate capabilities that surpass existing methods in terms of shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial continuity, and flexibility in dialogue length, thereby opening up new possibilities for practical dialogue video generation.

However, these methods heavily depend on the quality of generated data and struggle with fine-grained manipulation due to the lack of environment feedback. While video-based reinforcement learning improves policy robustness, it remains constrained by the uncertainty of video generation and the challenges of collecting large-scale robot datasets for training diffusion models. To address these limitations, we propose GenFlowRL, which derives shaped rewards from generated flow trained from diverse cross-embodiment datasets. This enables learning generalizable and robust policies from diverse demonstrations using low-dimensional, object-centric features. Experiments on 10 manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world cross-embodiment evaluations, demonstrate that GenFlowRL effectively leverages manipulation features extracted from generated object-centric flow, consistently achieving superior performance across diverse and challenging scenarios.

However, generating videos that adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video generation paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://haroldchen19.github.io/PhysHPO-Page/</p></details> |
| **[From Large Angles to Consistent Faces: Identity-Preserving Video Generation via Mixture of Facial Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09476v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations. First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The code and dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/rain152/LFA-Video-Generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM) that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

| **[AEGIS: Authenticity Evaluation Benchmark for AI-Generated Video Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10771v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity, failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse, state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion, CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats.

| **[EVCtrl: Efficient Control Adapter for Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10963v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches have achieved similar results either by out-painting 2D views of a scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry-which quickly accumulates errors-or by using video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a memory module that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost required to use all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 highlight.

| **[HM-Talker: Hybrid Motion Modeling for High-Fidelity Talking Head Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10566v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads. HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

| **[M2DAO-Talker: Harmonizing Multi-granular Motion Decoupling and Alternating Optimization for Talking-head Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08307v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur, temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization. Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy. Meanwhile, a motion consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS inference speed.

Existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals, promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face similarity.</p></details> |  |

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

| **[Human2Robot: Learning Robot Actions from Paired Human-Robot Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16587v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilling knowledge from human demonstrations is a promising way for robots to learn and act. Existing methods, which often rely on coarsely-aligned video pairs, are typically constrained to learning global or task-level features. As a result, they tend to neglect the fine-grained frame-level dynamics required for complex manipulation and generalization to novel tasks. We posit that this limitation stems from a vicious circle of inadequate datasets and the methods they inspire. To break this cycle, we propose a paradigm shift that treats fine-grained human-robot alignment as a conditional video generation problem. To this end, we first introduce H&R, a novel third-person dataset containing 2,600 episodes of precisely synchronized human and robot motions, collected using a VR teleoperation system. We then present Human2Robot, a framework designed to leverage this data. Human2Robot employs a Video Prediction Model to learn a rich and implicit representation of robot dynamics by generating robot videos from human input, which in turn guides a decoupled action decoder. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that this approach not only achieves high performance on seen tasks but also exhibits significant one-shot generalization to novel positions, objects, instances, and even new task categories.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression, one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses, and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised, end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained, semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Turbo-VAED: Fast and Stable Transfer of Video-VAEs to Mobile Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09136v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3) We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs, Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.</p></details> |  |

We present TaoCache, a training-free, plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast (PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks. Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the same speedups.</p></details> |  |

The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://causvid.github.io/</p></details> |

Generating 1K Video within 16 Seconds using Extremely Compressed Motion Latents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13552v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commercial video generation models have exhibited realistic, high-fidelity results but are still restricted to limited access. One crucial obstacle for large-scale applications is the expensive training and inference cost. In this paper, we argue that videos contain significantly more redundant information than images, allowing them to be encoded with very few motion latents. Towards this goal, we design an image-conditioned VAE that projects videos into extremely compressed latent space and decode them based on content images. This magic Reducio charm enables 64x reduction of latents compared to a common 2D VAE, without sacrificing the quality. Building upon Reducio-VAE, we can train diffusion models for high-resolution video generation efficiently. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage generation paradigm, first generating a condition image via text-to-image generation, followed by text-image-to-video generation with the proposed Reducio-DiT. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves strong performance in evaluation.

Although video generation models offer cost-efficient solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges, we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts (LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference. (2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of desired effects.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods can generate visually compelling videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper, we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention, concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion (trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both element-wise controllability and overall video quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jingyunliang.github.io/RealisMotion</p></details> |

Existing methods often rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation. Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just $\sim$1% additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks, such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation, stylization, and face swapping.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Context-as-Memory, which utilizes historical context as memory for video generation. It includes two simple yet effective designs: (1) storing context in frame format without additional post-processing; (2) conditioning by concatenating context and frames to be predicted along the frame dimension at the input, requiring no external control modules. Furthermore, considering the enormous computational overhead of incorporating all historical context, we propose the Memory Retrieval module to select truly relevant context frames by determining FOV (Field of View) overlap between camera poses, which significantly reduces the number of candidate frames without substantial information loss. Experiments demonstrate that Context-as-Memory achieves superior memory capabilities in interactive long video generation compared to SOTAs, even generalizing effectively to open-domain scenarios not seen during training.

| **[StableAvatar: Infinite-Length Audio-Driven Avatar Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08248v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio, StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this, StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  |

Recent works utilize video model to achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation.

We present a pose-free and training-free method that leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video generation model to produce immersive 3D videos. Our approach first warps the generated monocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth information, then applies a novel \textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework. This framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize missing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial and temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning. Moreover, we develop a \dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from disoccluded areas in the latent space. The resulting multi-view videos are then adapted into stereoscopic pairs or optimized into 4D Gaussians for spatial video synthesis. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting experiments on videos from various generative models, such as Sora, Lumiere, WALT, and Zeroscope. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a significant improvement over previous methods.

Current approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural 4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture: it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wanderer7-sk.github.io/Dream4D.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Video Signature: In-generation Watermarking for Latent Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00652v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has led to significant progress in video generation but also raises serious concerns about intellectual property protection and reliable content tracing. Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, but existing methods for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which introduces additional computational overhead and often fails to effectively balance the trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. To address these issues, we propose Video Signature (VIDSIG), an in-generation watermarking method for latent video diffusion models, which enables implicit and adaptive watermark integration during generation. Specifically, we achieve this by partially fine-tuning the latent decoder, where Perturbation-Aware Suppression (PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal consistency by introducing a lightweight Temporal Alignment module that guides the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning. Experimental results show that VIDSIG achieves the best overall performance in watermark extraction, visual quality, and generation efficiency. It also demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tampering, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

While these models provide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the physical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis. In contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and articulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised: \textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the motion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of reanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original sequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We introduce \textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for video-conditioned 4D restaging. Our approach uses a video-rewinding training strategy to temporally bridge a real base video and a synthetic driving video via a shared motion representation. We further incorporate an occlusion-aware rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural and geometry consistency under challenging motion. We validate Restage4D on DAVIS and PointOdyssey, demonstrating improved geometry consistency, motion quality, and 3D tracking performance. Our method not only preserves deformable structure under novel motion, but also automatically corrects errors introduced by generative models, revealing the potential of video prior in 4D restaging task.

Given a source image and a target lighting image, LumiNet synthesizes a relit version of the source scene that captures the target's lighting. Our approach makes two key contributions: a data curation strategy from the StyleGAN-based relighting model for our training, and a modified diffusion-based ControlNet that processes both latent intrinsic properties from the source image and latent extrinsic properties from the target image. We further improve lighting transfer through a learned adaptor (MLP) that injects the target's latent extrinsic properties via cross-attention and fine-tuning. Unlike traditional ControlNet, which generates images with conditional maps from a single scene, LumiNet processes latent representations from two different images - preserving geometry and albedo from the source while transferring lighting characteristics from the target. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully transfers complex lighting phenomena including specular highlights and indirect illumination across scenes with varying spatial layouts and materials, outperforming existing approaches on challenging indoor scenes using only images as input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrects an evaluation bug in Table 1 due to a data normalization error.

Recently, large generative models show potential to revolutionize auto-bidding by generating bids that could flexibly adapt to complex, competitive environments. Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address sparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards, as well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of states and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with generation uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between adjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss of ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a highly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal auto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed CBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random variable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the goal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated sequences' dynamic legitimacy. Then, we employ a trajectory-level return model to refine the generated trajectories, aligning more closely with advertisers' objectives. Experimental results across diverse settings demonstrate that our approach not only achieves superior performance on large-scale auto-bidding benchmarks, such as a 29.9% improvement in conversion value in the challenging sparse-reward auction setting, but also delivers significant improvements on the Kuaishou online advertising platform, including a 2.0% increase in target cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the MIA Vulnerability Gap Between Private GANs and Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03341v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality, remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.</p></details> |  |

Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images. However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting, are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry assets.

To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce the Radon-Nikodym Estimator (RNE). Based on the concept of the density ratio between path distributions, it reveals a fundamental connection between marginal densities and transition kernels, providing a flexible plug-and-play framework that unifies diffusion density estimation, inference-time control, and energy-based diffusion training under a single perspective.

However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025 Deep-Breath Workshop.

| **[The Information Dynamics of Generative Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19897v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of models in machine learning, yet a unified theoretical understanding of their operation is still developing. This perspective paper provides an integrated perspective on generative diffusion by connecting their dynamic, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic properties under a unified mathematical framework. We demonstrate that the rate of conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the generative bandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the score function's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the branching of trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis offers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by the controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks in information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible outcomes. The score function acts as a dynamic non-linear filter that regulates the bandwidth of the noise by suppressing fluctuations that are incompatible with the data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model for Brain Progression Modelling with Bidirectional Temporal Regularisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03141v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However, current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures, thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline (backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications, this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints. To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling.

However, due to the complex and diverse geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate this inefficiency, we propose FastCache, a hidden-state-level caching and compression framework that accelerates DiT inference by exploiting redundancy within the model's internal representations. FastCache introduces a dual strategy: (1) a spatial-aware token selection mechanism that adaptively filters redundant tokens based on hidden state saliency, and (2) a transformer-level cache that reuses latent activations across timesteps when changes are statistically insignificant. These modules work jointly to reduce unnecessary computation while preserving generation fidelity through learnable linear approximation. Theoretical analysis shows that FastCache maintains bounded approximation error under a hypothesis-testing-based decision rule. Empirical evaluations across multiple DiT variants demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and memory usage, with best generation output quality compared to other cache methods, as measured by FID and t-FID. Code implementation of FastCache is available on GitHub at https://github.com/NoakLiu/FastCache-xDiT.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCDB: Dynamic Conditional Dual Diffusion Bridge for Ill-posed Multi-Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03044v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network, demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets.

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

In this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data. We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively. Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate 3D radar perception.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater Visual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN, which enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater vehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles and maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain without relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting large-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures robust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater environments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model transfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases: we first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets using a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor on an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into the trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach.

We introduce Scaffold Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that, unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over 98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize generated samples and the generation process: https://scaffold.deepexploration.org/</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX; typos corrected, figure added</p></details> |

In contrast to generic reinforcement learning problems, our approach shows that fine-tuning can be achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.</p></details> |  |

We construct a deep learning framework with two residual-weighting schemes to solve reaction diffusion equations and evaluate its performance on both forward and inverse problems. The approach computes weights proportional to the PDE residuals, rescales them, and incorporates these scaled residuals into the loss function, leading to more stable training. Furthermore, we establish generalized error bounds that account for training and quadrature errors, and we analyze the convergence and stability of the method. The proposed algorithms are validated through numerical experiments on nonlinear equations, supported by statistical error analysis. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, we implemented PINN-based forward and inverse frameworks for the nonlinear equations and conducted a comparative analysis with the proposed RW-PINN approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenCompositor: Generative Video Compositing with Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02460v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production, serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production. Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration, resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner, allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE). Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task, called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in fidelity and consistency.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object. For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1.

However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching. Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved coverage compared to strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Diffusion Models for Generative Forecasting of Financial Charts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02308v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends. Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and expand their applicability.</p></details> |  |

The target distribution can be either explicitly given or learnt from a collection of samples. They implement a diffusion process whose endpoint is a sample from the target distribution. The drift of the diffusion process is typically represented as a neural network. Stochastic localization is a successful technique to prove mixing of Markov Chains and other functional inequalities in high dimension. An algorithmic version of stochastic localization was recently proposed in order to sample from certain statistical mechanics models. This expository article has three objectives: $(i)$~Generalize the algorithmic construction to other stochastic localization processes.

The scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the size and variability of training data. However, the potential of diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion; including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at AVSS 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[A Data-Centric Approach to Pedestrian Attribute Recognition: Synthetic Augmentation via Prompt-driven Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02099v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data. Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model, presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of attributes of pedestrians in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Acepted at AVSS 2025 conference.

| **[Palette Aligned Image Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02000v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows, they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters: histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette adherence and high image quality.</p></details> | 14 pages, 19 figures |

| **[Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Task-driven Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22459v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs. Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

| **[RadioDiff-Loc: Diffusion Model Enhanced Scattering Congnition for NLoS Localization with Sparse Radio Map Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01875v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate localization of non-cooperative signal sources in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge with a wide range of applications, including autonomous navigation, industrial automation, and emergency response. In such settings, traditional positioning techniques relying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe multipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel generative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional diffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted electromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling strategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at the geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information and mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack of known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to the maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant radio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the full RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization is then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM. Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based localization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical knowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach achieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost, offering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS emitter localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Gene Diffusion for Spatial Transcriptomics Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01864v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion, with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space. Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of its isolated components.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures.

Most approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach, effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge, enabling practical and general relighting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yoterel.github.io/PractiLight-project-page/</p></details> |

The temporal evolution of transmission rates in populations containing multiple types of individuals is reconstructed via an appropriate dimension-reduction formulation driven by independent diffusion processes. A suitably tailored compartmental model is used to learn the latent counts of infection, accounting for fluctuations in transmission influenced by public health interventions and changes in human behaviour. The model is fitted to freely available COVID-19 data sources from the UK, Greece, and Austria and validated using a large-scale prevalence survey in England.

| **[Debiasing Guidance for Discrete Diffusion with Sequential Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06079v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models are a class of generative models that produce samples from an approximated data distribution within a discrete state space. Often, there is a need to target specific regions of the data distribution. Current guidance methods aim to sample from a distribution with mass proportional to $p_0(x_0) p(\zeta|x_0)^\alpha$ but fail to achieve this in practice. We introduce a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that generates unbiasedly from this target distribution, utilising the learnt unconditional and guided process. We validate our approach on low-dimensional distributions, controlled images and text generations. For text generation, our method provides strong control while maintaining low perplexity compared to guidance-based approaches.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Bigger Isn't Always Memorizing: Early Stopping Overparameterized Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16959v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion probabilistic models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI, yet the mechanisms underlying their generalization remain poorly understood. In fact, if these models were perfectly minimizing their training loss, they would just generate data belonging to their training set, i.e., memorize, as empirically found in the overparameterized regime. We revisit this view by showing that, in highly overparameterized diffusion models, generalization in natural data domains is progressively achieved during training before the onset of memorization. Our results, ranging from image to language diffusion models, systematically support the empirical law that memorization time is proportional to the dataset size. Generalization vs. memorization is then best understood as a competition between time scales. We show that this phenomenology is recovered in diffusion models learning a simple probabilistic context-free grammar with random rules, where generalization corresponds to the hierarchical acquisition of deeper grammar rules as training time grows, and the generalization cost of early stopping can be characterized. We summarize these results in a phase diagram. Overall, our results support that a principled early-stopping criterion - scaling with dataset size - can effectively optimize generalization while avoiding memorization, with direct implications for hyperparameter transfer and privacy-sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Identical Diffusion Models in MIMO-OFDM Channel Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01641v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel diffusion model, termed the non-identical diffusion model, and investigate its application to wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channel generation. Unlike the standard diffusion model that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme. Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression. Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Sched: Pushing the Boundaries of Few-Step Diffusion Models with Quantization-Aware Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01624v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance, Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a 2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss, which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration. Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16 4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlled Latent Diffusion Models for 3D Porous Media Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24083v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Note: The final version of this article was published in Computers and Geosciences, Volume 206, January 2026, 106038. DOI: 10.1016/j.cageo.2025.106038. Readers should refer to the published version for the most up-to-date content. Three-dimensional digital reconstruction of porous media presents a fundamental challenge in geoscience, requiring simultaneous resolution of fine-scale pore structures while capturing representative elementary volumes. We introduce a computational framework that addresses this challenge through latent diffusion models operating within the EDM framework. Our approach reduces dimensionality via a custom variational autoencoder trained in binary geological volumes, improving efficiency and also enabling the generation of larger volumes than previously possible with diffusion models. A key innovation is our controlled unconditional sampling methodology, which enhances distribution coverage by first sampling target statistics from their empirical distributions, then generating samples conditioned on these values. Extensive testing on four distinct rock types demonstrates that conditioning on porosity - a readily computable statistic - is sufficient to ensure a consistent representation of multiple complex properties, including permeability, two-point correlation functions, and pore size distributions. The framework achieves better generation quality than pixel-space diffusion while enabling significantly larger volume reconstruction (256-cube voxels) with substantially reduced computational requirements, establishing a new state-of-the-art for digital rock physics applications.</p></details> | 58 pages |
| **[Acoustic Interference Suppression in Ultrasound images for Real-Time HIFU Monitoring Using an Image-Based Latent Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01557v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443 and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally, HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve the treatment precision in current clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lost in Latent Space: An Empirical Study of Latent Diffusion Models for Physics Emulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02608v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</p></details> |  |

This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error. Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Shapes are represented as Truncated Signed Distance Functions (TSDFs) and encoded into a discrete latent space jointly supervised by 2D and 3D cues, enabling efficient high-resolution processing while reducing GPU memory usage by 30\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach guides the generation process with flexible multimodal conditioning, ensuring consistent integration of 2D and 3D information from encoding to reconstruction. Our training strategy simulates realistic partial observations, avoiding assumptions about input structure and improving robustness in real-world scenarios. Leveraging our efficient latent space and multimodal conditioning, our model generalizes across object categories, outperforming class-specific models by 12\% and class-agnostic models by 47\% in $l_1$ reconstruction error, while producing more diverse, realistic, and high-fidelity completions than prior approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion: Calibrated and Efficient Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01330v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble, Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer sampling steps to reach strong performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEGDM: EEG Representation Learning via Generative Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14086v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large models often incurred high computational costs during both training and inference, with only marginal performance improvements as the model size increases. In this work, we proposed an EEG representation learning framework building upon Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed a structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained it using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) framework. Subsequently, the resulting latent EEG representations were then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used multi-event datasets covering both interictal epileptiform discharges (TUEV) and seizure (CHB-MIT) detection, and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method outperformed the existing methods. These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current FMs. Our source code and checkpoint are available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.</p></details> | <details><summary>EEGDM...</summary><p>EEGDM Preprint 10 Pages</p></details> |
| **[DiffDecompose: Layer-Wise Decomposition of Alpha-Composited Images via Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21541v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently motivated great success in many generation tasks like object removal. Nevertheless, existing image decomposition methods struggle to disentangle semi-transparent or transparent layer occlusions due to mask prior dependencies, static object assumptions, and the lack of datasets. In this paper, we delve into a novel task: Layer-Wise Decomposition of Alpha-Composited Images, aiming to recover constituent layers from single overlapped images under the condition of semi-transparent/transparent alpha layer non-linear occlusion. To address challenges in layer ambiguity, generalization, and data scarcity, we first introduce AlphaBlend, the first large-scale and high-quality dataset for transparent and semi-transparent layer decomposition, supporting six real-world subtasks (e.g., translucent flare removal, semi-transparent cell decomposition, glassware decomposition). Building on this dataset, we present DiffDecompose, a diffusion Transformer-based framework that learns the posterior over possible layer decompositions conditioned on the input image, semantic prompts, and blending type. Rather than regressing alpha mattes directly, DiffDecompose performs In-Context Decomposition, enabling the model to predict one or multiple layers without per-layer supervision, and introduces Layer Position Encoding Cloning to maintain pixel-level correspondence across layers. Extensive experiments on the proposed AlphaBlend dataset and public LOGO dataset verify the effectiveness of DiffDecompose. The code and dataset will be available upon paper acceptance. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/Wangzt1121/DiffDecompose.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms, left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training recipes, preprocessing pipelines, and inference code to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory-Efficient Personalization of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Selective Optimization Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10029v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable, high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 LIMIT Workshop (4-page short paper).

| **[RealMat: Realistic Materials with Diffusion and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01134v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively, recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL), encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related work.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01085v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Any-Order Flexible Length Masked Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01025v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations. To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference. Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve $\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance ($52\% \to 65\%$).</p></details> | Preprint |

The proposed ghost-penalty operator is straightforward to implement, ensures algebraic stability, provides an implicit extension of the solution beyond the physical domain, and stabilizes the numerical method for problems dominated by transport phenomena. This paper presents both a sharp interface version of the method and an alternative diffuse interface formulation designed to avoid integration over implicitly defined embedded surfaces. A complete numerical analysis of the sharp interface version is provided. The results of several numerical experiments support the theoretical analysis and illustrate the performance of both variants of the method.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in this direction have focused on diffusion models to explain a deep classifier. However, these techniques have predominantly focused on problems in computer vision. In this paper, we focus on tabular data typical in finance and the social sciences and propose a novel guided reverse process for categorical features based on an approximation to the Gumbel-softmax distribution. Furthermore, we study the effect of the temperature $\tau$ and derive a theoretical bound between the Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular datasets, assessing their performance in terms of the quantitative measures of interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity. These results indicate that our approach outperforms popular baseline methods, producing robust and realistic counterfactual explanations.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 30 figures, 2025 ACM Multimedia</p></details> |
| **[An Inexact Low-Rank Source Iteration for Steady-State Radiative Transfer Equation with Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00805v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an inexact low-rank source iteration with diffusion synthetic acceleration (SI-DSA) for solving the multidimensional steady-state radiative transfer equation (RTE) in the second-order formulation. The angular flux is represented in either a low-rank matrix or hierarchical Tucker tensor (HTT) format, enabling substantial reductions in computational resources. Each SI step is solved using a preconditioned low-rank conjugate gradient (CG) method with a diffusion preconditioner. To further improve efficiency, we introduce an adaptive inexact strategy that dynamically relaxes the inner CG tolerance during early SI iterations. The method exploits the tensor-product structure of the discretized operators to perform all matrix-vector operations in low-rank form. Numerical experiments on 2D2V benchmark problems, including diffusion-dominated, transport-dominated, and multiscale problems, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves errors on the order of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ relative to full-rank reference solutions, while reducing the degrees of freedom by up to two orders of magnitude. In the diffusion-dominated case, the low-rank solver achieves speedups exceeding $90\times$ over its full-rank counterpart and remains competitive in solving challenging transport-dominated and multiscale problems while providing substantial storage savings. To our knowledge, this work provides the first low-rank SI-DSA framework for multidimensional steady-state RTE.</p></details> | 29 pages, 15 figures |

Recently, their application has expanded to time series forecasting (TSF), yielding promising results. Existing surveys on time series primarily focus on the application of diffusion models to time series tasks or merely provide model-by-model introductions of diffusion-based TSF models, without establishing a systematic taxonomy for existing diffusion-based TSF models. In this survey, we firstly introduce several standard diffusion models and their prevalent variants, explaining their adaptation to TSF tasks. Then, we provide a comprehensive review of diffusion models for TSF, paying special attention to the sources of conditional information and the mechanisms for integrating this conditioning within the models. In analyzing existing approaches using diffusion models for TSF, we provide a systematic categorization and a comprehensive summary of them in this survey. Furthermore, we examine several foundational diffusion models applied to TSF, alongside commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the progress and limitations of these approaches, as well as potential future research directions for diffusion-based TSF. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent progress and future prospects for diffusion models in TSF, serving as a valuable reference for researchers in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Image-to-Brain Signal Generation with Cross-Attention Mechanisms for Visual Prostheses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00787v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion Sampling via Exploiting Local Transition Coherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09675v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in generating high-quality images and videos from textual descriptions. However, the lengthy sampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in practical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical relationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity between them, which often only works with specific network structures. To address this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the transition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the outputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on the network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel training-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified relationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent steps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure, LTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to almost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with them. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up sampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining competitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of 1.67-fold in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55-fold in video generation models. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable 10-fold speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than 16FPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward-Weighted Sampling: Enhancing Non-Autoregressive Characteristics in Masked Diffusion LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00707v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs, such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward. Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of MDMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Paper (Long)</p></details> |

Existing query-aware serving systems mitigate the cost by cascading lightweight and heavyweight models, but most rely on a fixed cascade configuration and route all prompts through an initial lightweight stage, wasting resources on complex queries. We present HADIS, a hybrid adaptive diffusion model serving system that jointly optimizes cascade model selection, query routing, and resource allocation. HADIS employs a rule-based prompt router to send clearly hard queries directly to heavyweight models, bypassing the overhead of the lightweight stage. To reduce the complexity of resource management, HADIS uses an offline profiling phase to produce a Pareto-optimal cascade configuration table. At runtime, HADIS selects the best cascade configuration and GPU allocation given latency and workload constraints. Empirical evaluations on real-world traces demonstrate that HADIS improves response quality by up to 35% while reducing latency violation rates by 2.7-45$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art model serving systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

The proposed PFD-BDCM framework addresses the restrictions of the existing approaches by uniquely integrating models for complex spatio-temporal dynamics with the analysis of multi-resolution variables. Specifically, the framework systematically mitigates confounding bias by integrating valid backdoor adjustment sets into a diffusion-based sampling mechanism. Moreover, it accounts for the intricate dynamics of unmeasured confounders through the deployment of region-specific structural equations and conditional autoregressive processes, and accommodates variables observed at heterogeneous resolutions via basis expansions for functional data. Our theoretical analysis establishes error bounds for counterfactual estimates of PFD-BDCM, formally linking reconstruction accuracy to counterfactual fidelity under monotonicity assumptions of structural equation and invertibility assumptions of encoding function. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets and real-world air pollution data demonstrate PFD-BDCM's superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

This paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1) Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its robust zero-shot generalization capability.

| **[Double-Constraint Diffusion Model with Nuclear Regularization for Ultra-low-dose PET Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00395v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility. Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model, ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Negative Transfer: Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00389v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across domains to enhance recommendation quality. However, naive aggregation of sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences, leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences, and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose \textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge. DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[NoiseCutMix: A Novel Data Augmentation Approach by Mixing Estimated Noise in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00378v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods.

| **[Iterative Distillation for Reward-Guided Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models in Biomolecular Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00445v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge. Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein, small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior work that studied FAT or FAP separately, we obtain an explicit joint probability density function under constant drift and isotropic diffusion in arbitrary dimensions, revealing a nontrivial spatiotemporal coupling. Based on this result, we compute the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and show that joint observations enable estimation of lateral drift and improve sensitivity to diffusion -- capabilities not attainable with time-only or position-only models.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |
| **[LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion: Enhancing Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00347v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios. However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and adaptability in diverse settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving dynamic portfolio selection problems via score-based diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09916v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle the dynamic mean-variance portfolio selection problem in a {\it model-free} manner, based on (generative) diffusion models. We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathbb P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathbb Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&P 500.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on https://github.com/fy-yuan/diffusion_dynamic_mv. v2 addresses certain typos and small issues</p></details> |
| **[Are We Really Learning the Score Function? Reinterpreting Diffusion Models Through Wasserstein Gradient Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00336v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow" arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for understanding diffusion generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards High-Fidelity and Controllable Bioacoustic Generation via Enhanced Diffusion Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00318v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling offers new opportunities for bioacoustics, enabling the synthesis of realistic animal vocalizations that could support biomonitoring efforts and supplement scarce data for endangered species. However, directly generating bird call waveforms from noisy field recordings remains a major challenge. We propose BirdDiff, a generative framework designed to synthesize bird calls from a noisy dataset of 12 wild bird species. The model incorporates a "zeroth layer" stage for multi-scale adaptive bird-call enhancement, followed by a diffusion-based generator conditioned on three modalities: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, species labels, and textual descriptions. The enhancement stage improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while minimizing spectral distortion, achieving the highest SNR gain (+10.45 dB) and lowest Itakura-Saito Distance (0.54) compared to three widely used non-training enhancement methods. We evaluate BirdDiff against a baseline generative model, DiffWave. Our method yields substantial improvements in generative quality metrics: Fr\'echet Audio Distance (0.590 to 0.213), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (0.259 to 0.226), and Number of Statistically-Different Bins (7.33 to 5.58). To assess species-specific detail preservation, we use a ResNet50 classifier trained on the original dataset to identify generated samples. Classification accuracy improves from 35.9% (DiffWave) to 70.1% (BirdDiff), with 8 of 12 species exceeding 70% accuracy. These results demonstrate that BirdDiff enables high-fidelity, controllable bird call generation directly from noisy field recordings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuously Tempered Diffusion Samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00316v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available at https://github.com/eje24/ctds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Dynamics Models with Generative State Estimation for Cloth Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11999v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth manipulation is challenging due to its highly complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate both state estimation and dynamics modeling. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Therefore, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing full cloth states from partial observations and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves accurate state reconstruction and reduces long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to prior approaches. We integrate our dynamics models with model predictive control and show that our framework enables effective cloth folding on real robotic systems, demonstrating the potential of generative models for deformable object manipulation under partial observability and complex dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL ...</summary><p>CoRL 2025.

While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

| **[Tree-Guided Diffusion Planner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21800v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process: (1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on all tasks.
