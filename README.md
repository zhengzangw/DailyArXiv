| **[Geometry Forcing: Marrying Video Diffusion and 3D Representation for Consistent World Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07982v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However, our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods.

| **[Martian World Models: Controllable Video Synthesis with Physically Accurate 3D Reconstructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07978v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data, synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally, camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://marsgenai.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Scaling RL to Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are available at https://github.com/NVlabs/Long-RL</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal Generative AI: Multi-modal LLMs, Diffusions and the Unification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14993v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry. Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we present several challenging future research directions which may contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[VMem: Consistent Interactive Video Scene Generation with Surfel-Indexed View Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18903v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel memory mechanism to build video generators that can explore environments interactively. Similar results have previously been achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://v-mem.github.io</p></details> |
| **[T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[FluidNexus: 3D Fluid Reconstruction and Prediction from a Single Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04720v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study reconstructing and predicting 3D fluid appearance and velocity from a single video. Current methods require multi-view videos for fluid reconstruction. We present FluidNexus, a novel framework that bridges video generation and physics simulation to tackle this task. Our key insight is to synthesize multiple novel-view videos as references for reconstruction. FluidNexus consists of two key components: (1) a novel-view video synthesizer that combines frame-wise view synthesis with video diffusion refinement for generating realistic videos, and (2) a physics-integrated particle representation coupling differentiable simulation and rendering to simultaneously facilitate 3D fluid reconstruction and prediction. To evaluate our approach, we collect two new real-world fluid datasets featuring textured backgrounds and object interactions. Our method enables dynamic novel view synthesis, future prediction, and interaction simulation from a single fluid video.

| **[A Survey on Long-Video Storytelling Generation: Architectures, Consistency, and Cinematic Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07202v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16 seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16 seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their architectural designs and performance characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIP-I2V: A Million-Scale Real Text and Image Prompt Dataset for Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04709v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models are revolutionizing content creation, with image-to-video models drawing increasing attention due to their enhanced controllability, visual consistency, and practical applications. However, despite their popularity, these models rely on user-provided text and image prompts, and there is currently no dedicated dataset for studying these prompts. In this paper, we introduce TIP-I2V, the first large-scale dataset of over 1.70 million unique user-provided Text and Image Prompts specifically for Image-to-Video generation. Additionally, we provide the corresponding generated videos from five state-of-the-art image-to-video models. We begin by outlining the time-consuming and costly process of curating this large-scale dataset. Next, we compare TIP-I2V to two popular prompt datasets, VidProM (text-to-video) and DiffusionDB (text-to-image), highlighting differences in both basic and semantic information. This dataset enables advancements in image-to-video research. For instance, to develop better models, researchers can use the prompts in TIP-I2V to analyze user preferences and evaluate the multi-dimensional performance of their trained models; and to enhance model safety, they may focus on addressing the misinformation issue caused by image-to-video models. The new research inspired by TIP-I2V and the differences with existing datasets emphasize the importance of a specialized image-to-video prompt dataset.

| **[LongAnimation: Long Animation Generation with Dynamic Global-Local Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01945v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore, automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation. Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color consistency for open-domain animation colorization task. The code can be found at https://cn-makers.github.io/long_animation_web/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Grounded Motion Forecasting via Equation Discovery for Trajectory-Guided Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06830v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions, our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Democratizing High-Fidelity Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06812v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic, audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image, predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while generalizing across speakers and contexts.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Omni-Video: Democratizing Unified Video Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06119v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, project page: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/OmniVideo_project/</p></details> |
| **[PromptTea: Let Prompts Tell TeaCache the Optimal Threshold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06739v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues, PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example, 2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across a range of scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCamMaster: Camera-Controlled Generative Rendering from A Single Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11647v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera control has been actively studied in text or image conditioned video generation tasks. However, altering camera trajectories of a given video remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation. It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories. The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video conditioning mechanism--its capability is often overlooked in current research. To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5, which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics, covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our method also finds promising applications in video stabilization, super-resolution, and outpainting. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/ReCamMaster.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jianhongbai.github.io/ReCamMaster/</p></details> |
| **[Tora2: Motion and Appearance Customized Diffusion Transformer for Multi-Entity Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05963v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

| **[FIFA: Unified Faithfulness Evaluation Framework for Text-to-Video and Video-to-Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06523v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in both text and video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Stabilized and Efficient Diffusion Transformers through Long-Skip-Connections with Spectral Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17616v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high fidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish Long-Skip-Connections as critical architectural components for stable and efficient diffusion transformers. Codes are provided in the https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Skip-DiT.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios, providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further research in medical video generation.

Synthesizing sustained footage (e.g. over minutes) still remains an open research question. In this paper, we propose MALT Diffusion (using Memory-Augmented Latent Transformers), a new diffusion model specialized for long video generation. MALT Diffusion (or just MALT) handles long videos by subdividing them into short segments and doing segment-level autoregressive generation. To achieve this, we first propose recurrent attention layers that encode multiple segments into a compact memory latent vector; by maintaining this memory vector over time, MALT is able to condition on it and continuously generate new footage based on a long temporal context. We also present several training techniques that enable the model to generate frames over a long horizon with consistent quality and minimal degradation. We validate the effectiveness of MALT through experiments on long video benchmarks. We first perform extensive analysis of MALT in long-contextual understanding capability and stability using popular long video benchmarks. For example, MALT achieves an FVD score of 220.4 on 128-frame video generation on UCF-101, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of 648.4. Finally, we explore MALT's capabilities in a text-to-video generation setting and show that it can produce long videos compared with recent techniques for long text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop on AI for Content Creation (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[StreamDiT: Real-Time Streaming Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03745v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive generation, and video-to-video.

| **[HV-MMBench: Benchmarking MLLMs for Human-Centric Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04909v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |

However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that generates both audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. By using a unified denoising network, UniForm captures the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Additionally, we propose task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling the model to support multiple tasks with a single set of parameters, including video-to-audio, audio-to-video and text-to-audio-video generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Experiments show that UniForm achieves performance close to the state-of-the-art single-task models across three generation tasks, with generated content that is not only highly aligned with real-world data distributions but also enables more diverse and fine-grained generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our demos are available at https://uniform-t2av.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Music2Palette: Emotion-aligned Color Palette Generation via Cross-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04758v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion alignment between music and palettes is crucial for effective multimedia content, yet misalignment creates confusion that weakens the intended message. However, existing methods often generate only a single dominant color, missing emotion variation. Others rely on indirect mappings through text or images, resulting in the loss of crucial emotion details. To address these challenges, we present Music2Palette, a novel method for emotion-aligned color palette generation via cross-modal representation learning. We first construct MuCED, a dataset of 2,634 expert-validated music-palette pairs aligned through Russell-based emotion vectors. To directly translate music into palettes, we propose a cross-modal representation learning framework with a music encoder and color decoder. We further propose a multi-objective optimization approach that jointly enhances emotion alignment, color diversity, and palette coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current methods in interpreting music emotion and generating attractive and diverse color palettes. Our approach enables applications like music-driven image recoloring, video generating, and data visualization, bridging the gap between auditory and visual emotion experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation Guided by Simple yet Effective Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04705v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.</p></details> |  |

We address these issues to enhance the consistency and coherence of videos generated with either single or multiple prompts. We propose the Time-frequency based temporal Attention Reweighting Algorithm (TiARA), which judiciously edits the attention score matrix based on the Discrete Short-Time Fourier Transform. This method is supported by a frequency-based analysis, ensuring that the edited attention score matrix achieves improved consistency across frames. It represents the first-of-its-kind for frequency-based methods in video diffusion models. For videos generated by multiple prompts, we further uncover key factors such as the alignment of the prompts affecting prompt interpolation quality. Inspired by our analyses, we propose PromptBlend, an advanced prompt interpolation pipeline that systematically aligns the prompts. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating consistent and substantial improvements over multiple baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Building Physically Plausible World Models (Best Paper), 32 pages, 17 figures</p></details> |

However, generating temporally coherent and visually realistic videos remains a significant challenge due to the high dimensionality and complex dynamics of video data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep generative network architecture designed specifically for high-resolution video synthesis. Our approach integrates key concepts from Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs), enforcing a k-Lipschitz continuity constraint on the discriminator to stabilize training and enhance convergence. We further leverage Conditional GAN (cGAN) techniques by incorporating class labels during both training and inference, enabling class-specific video generation with improved semantic consistency. We provide a detailed layer-wise description of the Generator and Discriminator networks, highlighting architectural design choices promoting temporal coherence and spatial detail. The overall combined architecture, training algorithm, and optimization strategy are thoroughly presented. Our training objective combines a pixel-wise mean squared error loss with an adversarial loss to balance frame-level accuracy and video realism. We validate our approach on benchmark datasets including UCF101, Golf, and Aeroplane, encompassing diverse motion patterns and scene contexts. Quantitative evaluations using Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art unsupervised video generation methods in terms of both quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |

Processing these videos generates valuable assets for training sophisticated models. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-RL, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training model tailored for semantic segmentation for surgical scenes. CLIP-RL presents a new segmentation approach which involves reinforcement learning and curriculum learning, enabling continuous refinement of the segmentation masks during the full training pipeline. Our model has shown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions, texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges. CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic context that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL module plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through iterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018 and EndoVis 2017 datasets. CLIP-RL achieved a mean IoU of 81%, outperforming state-of-the-art models, and a mean IoU of 74.12% on EndoVis 2017. This superior performance was achieved due to the combination of contrastive learning with reinforcement learning and curriculum learning.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches are limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames, generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible presentation formats. Code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/PresentAgent.</p></details> |  |

However, the slow inference speed and high computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this, we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient, high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating videos in a wide range of scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nextframed.github.io/</p></details> |

As a result, there are also growing concerns about the potential misuse of video generation for spreading illegal content and misinformation. In this work, we introduce VGMShield: a set of straightforward but effective mitigations through the lifecycle of fake video generation. We start from fake video detection, trying to understand whether there is uniqueness in generated videos and whether we can differentiate them from real videos; then, we investigate the fake video source tracing problem, which maps a fake video back to the model that generated it. Towards these, we propose to leverage pre-trained models that focus on spatial-temporal dynamics as the backbone to identify inconsistencies in videos. In detail, we analyze fake videos from the perspective of the generation process. Based on the observation of attention shifts, motion variations, and frequency fluctuations, we identify common patterns in the generated video. These patterns serve as the foundation for our experiments on fake video detection and source tracing. Through experiments on seven state-of-the-art open-source models, we demonstrate that current models still cannot reliably reproduce spatial-temporal relationships, and thus, we can accomplish detection and source tracing with over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, anticipating future generative model improvements, we propose a prevention method that adds invisible perturbations to the query images to make the generated videos look unreal. Together with detection and tracing, our multi-faceted set of solutions can effectively mitigate misuse of video generative models.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600, UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters, across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.

However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content. Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video generation.

In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</p></details> |  |

We innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD), which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos. Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex, robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA models.

Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, potentially limiting their applications. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which improves the image quality by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. SG only relies on the sampling probabilities of its own diffusion model at different noise levels with no need of any guidance-specific training. This makes it flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms. We also introduce a more efficient approximation of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid doubling sampling time. We conduct experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG with only one forward pass. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability of eliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We will release our code along with this paper.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Models for Language Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07050v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution, followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation. Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed. Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of 4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting future work in non-autoregressive language generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>pdfLa...</summary><p>pdfLaTeX, 69 pages with 21 figures, Licentiate Thesis</p></details> |

Current research on video generation suggests a promising avenue for controllable film creation in pixel space using Diffusion models. However, the reliance on overly verbose prompts and insufficient focus on cinematic elements (e.g., camera movement) results in videos that lack cinematic quality. Furthermore, the absence of 3D modeling often leads to failures in video generation, such as inconsistent character models at different frames, ultimately hindering the immersive experience for viewers. In this paper, we propose a new framework for film creation, Dream-Cinema, which is designed for user-friendly, 3D space-based film creation with generative models. Specifically, we decompose 3D film creation into four key elements: 3D character, driven motion, camera movement, and environment. We extract the latter three elements from user-specified film shots and generate the 3D character using a generative model based on a provided image. To seamlessly recombine these elements and ensure smooth film creation, we propose structure-guided character animation, shape-aware camera movement optimization, and environment-aware generative refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating high-quality films with free camera and 3D characters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://liuff19.github.io/DreamCinema</p></details> |

Among them, Stable Diffusion (StableDiff) stands out as a key model for text-to-image generation and a foundation for next-generation multi-modal algorithms. However, its high computational and memory demands hinder inference speed and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we identify three core issues: (1) intensive and often redundant computations, (2) heterogeneous operations involving convolutions and attention mechanisms, and (3) diverse weight and activation sizes. We present SD-Acc, a novel algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework. At the algorithm level, we observe that high-level features in certain denoising phases show significant similarity, enabling approximate computation. Leveraging this, we propose an adaptive, phase-aware sampling strategy that reduces compute and memory loads. This framework automatically balances image quality and complexity based on the StableDiff model and user requirements. At the hardware level, we design an address-centric dataflow to efficiently handle heterogeneous operations within a simple systolic array. We address the bottleneck of nonlinear functions via a two-stage streaming architecture and a reconfigurable vector processing unit. Additionally, we implement adaptive dataflow optimizations by combining dynamic reuse and operator fusion tailored to StableDiff workloads, significantly reducing memory access. Across multiple StableDiff models, our method achieves up to a 3x reduction in computational demand without compromising image quality. Combined with our optimized hardware accelerator, SD-Acc delivers higher speed and energy efficiency than traditional CPU and GPU implementations.</p></details> | Under Review |

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Existing metrics are limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos. Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising 2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5% quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive, human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2 and AIGVE-MACS at https://huggingface.co/xiaoliux/AIGVE-MACS.</p></details> | Working in Progress |

We introduce ConceptAttention, a novel method that leverages the expressive power of DiT attention layers to generate high-quality saliency maps that precisely locate textual concepts within images. Without requiring additional training, ConceptAttention repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce highly contextualized concept embeddings, contributing the major discovery that performing linear projections in the output space of DiT attention layers yields significantly sharper saliency maps compared to commonly used cross-attention maps. ConceptAttention even achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot image segmentation benchmarks, outperforming 15 other zero-shot interpretability methods on the ImageNet-Segmentation dataset.

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX.

While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://robot4dgen.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Listener-Rewarded Thinking in VLMs for Image Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22832v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model ("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score, shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6% over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here: https://huggingface.co/alexgambashidze/qwen2.5vl_image_preference_reasoner.</p></details> |  |

We explore the affordance perception potential of text-to-video models by teaching them to predict human-environment interaction. Given a scene image and a prompt describing human actions, we fine-tune the model to insert a person into the scene, while ensuring coherent behavior, appearance, harmonization, and scene affordance. Unlike prior work, we infer human affordance for video generation (i.e., where to insert a person and how they should behave) from a single scene image, without explicit conditions like bounding boxes or body poses. An in-depth study of cross-attention heatmaps demonstrates that we can uncover the inherent affordance perception of a pre-trained video model without labeled affordance datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://shanmy.github.io/Populate-A-Scene</p></details> |
| **[FreeLong++: Training-Free Long Video Generation via Multi-band SpectralFusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00162v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation models have enabled high-quality short video generation from text prompts. However, extending these models to longer videos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal consistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively applying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable quality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where high-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows, an issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose FreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong achieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic semantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted from short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this, FreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture with multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale. By arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables multi-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both semantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video sequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into existing video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer videos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video generation tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length). It also supports coherent multi-prompt video generation with smooth scene transitions and enables controllable video generation using long depth or pose sequences.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Epona: Autoregressive Diffusion World Model for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24113v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling. However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning. This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end planners on NAVSIM benchmarks.

While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for high-res video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VMoBA</p></details> |

Existing approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or ''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines.

More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles.

However, incorporating causal relations as seen in real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion, Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video generation.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

However, directly applying existing video editing methods to Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at least 20x inference speed-up and 85% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Zero-...</summary><p>Zero-shot video editing</p></details> |
| **[RoboEnvision: A Long-Horizon Video Generation Model for Multi-Task Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22007v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon, leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames, achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on long-horizon tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding, their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation. This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce ShotBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed (predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60% average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct ShotQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop ShotVL through supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on ShotBench, establishing new state-of-the-art performance. We open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmoothSinger: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Singing Voice Synthesis with Multi-Resolution Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21478v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Singing voice synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive and high-quality vocals from musical scores, requiring precise modeling of pitch, duration, and articulation. While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to the complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in artifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a conditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural singing voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage and often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized audio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated with two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch architecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference to guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware synthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel low-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch contours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during training, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio, addressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals. Experiments on the Opencpop dataset, a large-scale Chinese singing corpus, demonstrate that SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective evaluations. Extensive ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing artifacts and improving the naturalness of synthesized voices.</p></details> |  |

Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame, HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for practical surgical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames. Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods, though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task, which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI is superior to previous works.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding.

Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures. Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both visual quality and temporal coherence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Perception Models for 3D Scene Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20601v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability, which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes. Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation, utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse scenarios. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, existing panoramic video generation models struggle to leverage pre-trained generative priors from conventional text-to-video models for high-quality and diverse panoramic videos generation, due to limited dataset scale and the gap in spatial feature representations. In this paper, we introduce PanoWan to effectively lift pre-trained text-to-video models to the panoramic domain, equipped with minimal modules. PanoWan employs latitude-aware sampling to avoid latitudinal distortion, while its rotated semantic denoising and padded pixel-wise decoding ensure seamless transitions at longitude boundaries. To provide sufficient panoramic videos for learning these lifted representations, we contribute PanoVid, a high-quality panoramic video dataset with captions and diverse scenarios. Consequently, PanoWan achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and demonstrates robustness for zero-shot downstream tasks.

Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust. Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs) on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on artifact localization in generative video models.

A Comprehensive Survey of World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14499v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of world models has garnered significant attention due to advancements in multimodal large language models such as GPT-4 and video generation models such as Sora, which are central to the pursuit of artificial general intelligence. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the literature on world models. Generally, world models are regarded as tools for either understanding the present state of the world or predicting its future dynamics. This review presents a systematic categorization of world models, emphasizing two primary functions: (1) constructing internal representations to understand the mechanisms of the world, and (2) predicting future states to simulate and guide decision-making. Initially, we examine the current progress in these two categories. We then explore the application of world models in key domains, including autonomous driving, robotics, and social simulacra, with a focus on how each domain utilizes these aspects.

In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/radial-attention</p></details> |
| **[GenHSI: Controllable Generation of Human-Scene Interaction Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19840v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes (storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images. We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training. Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible human-scene interaction from a single image scene.

However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage available at https://simplegvr.github.io/</p></details> |

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what' together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise, fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance over multiple state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing reward models, designed primarily for real-world videos, fail to capture the unique appearance and consistency requirements of anime. In this work, we propose a pipeline to enhance anime video generation by leveraging human feedback for better alignment. Specifically, we construct the first multi-dimensional reward dataset for anime videos, comprising 30k human-annotated samples that incorporating human preferences for both visual appearance and visual consistency. Based on this, we develop AnimeReward, a powerful reward model that employs specialized vision-language models for different evaluation dimensions to guide preference alignment. Furthermore, we introduce Gap-Aware Preference Optimization (GAPO), a novel training method that explicitly incorporates preference gaps into the optimization process, enhancing alignment performance and efficiency. Extensive experiment results show that AnimeReward outperforms existing reward models, and the inclusion of GAPO leads to superior alignment in both quantitative benchmarks and human evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing anime video quality.

Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing training-free methods, originally designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models. To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality while preserving high efficiency.

Unlike prior works focused on game-style visuals, RealPlay aims to produce photorealistic, temporally consistent video sequences that resemble real-world footage. It operates in an interactive loop: users observe a generated scene, issue a control command, and receive a short video chunk in response. To enable such realistic and responsive generation, we address key challenges including iterative chunk-wise prediction for low-latency feedback, temporal consistency across iterations, and accurate control response. RealPlay is trained on a combination of labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos, without requiring real-world action annotations. Notably, we observe two forms of generalization: (1) control transfer-RealPlay effectively maps control signals from virtual to real-world scenarios; and (2) entity transfer-although training labels originate solely from a car racing game, RealPlay generalizes to control diverse real-world entities, including bicycles and pedestrians, beyond vehicles.

However, existing film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and thus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse camera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and unengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end AI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for professional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard outputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography from extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional, audience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles, FilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which transforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage which transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual and auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a Multi-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in generating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a vast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates professional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm Control module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by simulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements to achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models like (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive experiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and cinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://filmaster-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation. MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features, while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction. This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of unified world modeling in robotics.</p></details> |  |

They also struggle with precise prompt control for fine-grained generation. To tackle these challenges, we introduce OmniAvatar, an innovative audio-driven full-body video generation model that enhances human animation with improved lip-sync accuracy and natural movements. OmniAvatar introduces a pixel-wise multi-hierarchical audio embedding strategy to better capture audio features in the latent space, enhancing lip-syncing across diverse scenes.

However, existing models still face significant challenges in faithfully following textual instructions. This limitation, commonly known as the copy-paste problem, arises from the widely used in-pair training paradigm. This approach inherently entangles subject identity with background and contextual attributes by sampling reference images from the same scene as the target video. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Phantom-Data, the first general-purpose cross-pair subject-to-video consistency dataset}, containing approximately one million identity-consistent pairs across diverse categories. Our dataset is constructed via a three-stage pipeline: (1) a general and input-aligned subject detection module, (2) large-scale cross-context subject retrieval from more than 53 million videos and 3 billion images, and (3) prior-guided identity verification to ensure visual consistency under contextual variation. Comprehensive experiments show that training with Phantom-Data significantly improves prompt alignment and visual quality while preserving identity consistency on par with in-pair baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page:https://phantom-video.github.io/Phantom-Data/</p></details> |

Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to generate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across diverse game scenarios. To facilitate future research on interactive image-to-world generation, we will open-source the Matrix-Game model weights and the GameWorld Score benchmark at https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Matrix-Game.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[VideoMark: A Distortion-Free Robust Watermarking Framework for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16359v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces \textbf{VideoMark}, a distortion-free robust watermarking framework for video diffusion models. As diffusion models excel in generating realistic videos, reliable content attribution is increasingly critical. However, existing video watermarking methods often introduce distortion by altering the initial distribution of diffusion variables and are vulnerable to temporal attacks, such as frame deletion, due to variable video lengths. VideoMark addresses these challenges by employing a \textbf{pure pseudorandom initialization} to embed watermarks, avoiding distortion while ensuring uniform noise distribution in the latent space to preserve generation quality. To enhance robustness, we adopt a frame-wise watermarking strategy with pseudorandom error correction (PRC) codes, using a fixed watermark sequence with randomly selected starting indices for each video. For watermark extraction, we propose a Temporal Matching Module (TMM) that leverages edit distance to align decoded messages with the original watermark sequence, ensuring resilience against temporal attacks. Experimental results show that VideoMark achieves higher decoding accuracy than existing methods while maintaining video quality comparable to watermark-free generation. The watermark remains imperceptible to attackers without the secret key, offering superior invisibility compared to other frameworks. VideoMark provides a practical, training-free solution for content attribution in diffusion-based video generation.

| **[RDPO: Real Data Preference Optimization for Physics Consistency Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18655v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation techniques have achieved remarkable advancements in visual quality, yet faithfully reproducing real-world physics remains elusive. Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well. Benefiting from the dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO significantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the generated videos. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks and human evaluations have demonstrated that RDPO achieves improvements across multiple dimensions.

In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model. Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[VQ-Insight: Teaching VLMs for AI-Generated Video Quality Understanding via Progressive Visual Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18564v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have led to the emergence of powerful text-to-video generation models. Despite these successes, evaluating the quality of AIGC-generated videos remains challenging due to limited generalization, lack of temporal awareness, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated datasets, and the lack of effective interaction with generation models. Most current approaches rely on supervised finetuning of vision-language models (VLMs), which often require large-scale annotated datasets and tend to decouple understanding and generation. To address these shortcomings, we propose VQ-Insight, a novel reasoning-style VLM framework for AIGC video quality assessment. Our approach features: (1) a progressive video quality learning scheme that combines image quality warm-up, general task-specific temporal learning, and joint optimization with the video generation model; (2) the design of multi-dimension scoring rewards, preference comparison rewards, and temporal modeling rewards to enhance both generalization and specialization in video quality evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VQ-Insight consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in preference comparison, multi-dimension scoring, and natural video scoring, bringing significant improvements for video generation tasks.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Despite advancements in pose-guided human video generation, creating product promotion videos remains challenging. In addressing this challenge, we identify the integration of human-object interactions (HOI) into pose-guided human video generation as a core issue. To this end, we introduce AnchorCrafter, a novel diffusion-based system designed to generate 2D videos featuring a target human and a customized object, achieving high visual fidelity and controllable interactions. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: the HOI-appearance perception, which enhances object appearance recognition from arbitrary multi-view perspectives and disentangles object and human appearance, and the HOI-motion injection, which enables complex human-object interactions by overcoming challenges in object trajectory conditioning and inter-occlusion management. Extensive experiments show that our system improves object appearance preservation by 7.5\% and doubles the object localization accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. It also outperforms existing approaches in maintaining human motion consistency and high-quality video generation.

| **[Emergent Temporal Correspondences from Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17220v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video diffusion models based on Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in generating temporally coherent videos. Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models. Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/DiffTrack</p></details> |

To better protect individuals, organizations, and societies from its malicious applications, we describe an effective and robust technique for distinguishing real from AI-generated human motion using multi-modal semantic embeddings. Our method is robust to the types of laundering that typically confound more low- to mid-level approaches, including resolution and compression attacks. This method is evaluated against DeepAction, a custom-built, open-sourced dataset of video clips with human actions generated by seven text-to-video AI models and matching real footage.

| **[SurgSora: Object-Aware Diffusion Model for Controllable Surgical Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14018v3)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical video generation can enhance medical education and research, but existing methods lack fine-grained motion control and realism. We introduce SurgSora, a framework that generates high-fidelity, motion-controllable surgical videos from a single input frame and user-specified motion cues. Unlike prior approaches that treat objects indiscriminately or rely on ground-truth segmentation masks, SurgSora leverages self-predicted object features and depth information to refine RGB appearance and optical flow for precise video synthesis. It consists of three key modules: (1) the Dual Semantic Injector, which extracts object-specific RGB-D features and segmentation cues to enhance spatial representations; (2) the Decoupled Flow Mapper, which fuses multi-scale optical flow with semantic features for realistic motion dynamics; and (3) the Trajectory Controller, which estimates sparse optical flow and enables user-guided object movement. By conditioning these enriched features within the Stable Video Diffusion, SurgSora achieves state-of-the-art visual authenticity and controllability in advancing surgical video synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Our human evaluation in collaboration with expert surgeons further demonstrates the high realism of SurgSora-generated videos, highlighting the potential of our method for surgical training and education.

| **[How Far is Video Generation from World Model: A Physical Law Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02385v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OpenAI's Sora highlights the potential of video generation for developing world models that adhere to fundamental physical laws. However, the ability of video generation models to discover such laws purely from visual data without human priors can be questioned. A world model learning the true law should give predictions robust to nuances and correctly extrapolate on unseen scenarios. In this work, we evaluate across three key scenarios: in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and combinatorial generalization. We developed a 2D simulation testbed for object movement and collisions to generate videos deterministically governed by one or more classical mechanics laws. This provides an unlimited supply of data for large-scale experimentation and enables quantitative evaluation of whether the generated videos adhere to physical laws. We trained diffusion-based video generation models to predict object movements based on initial frames. Our scaling experiments show perfect generalization within the distribution, measurable scaling behavior for combinatorial generalization, but failure in out-of-distribution scenarios. Further experiments reveal two key insights about the generalization mechanisms of these models: (1) the models fail to abstract general physical rules and instead exhibit "case-based" generalization behavior, i.e., mimicking the closest training example; (2) when generalizing to new cases, models are observed to prioritize different factors when referencing training data: color > size > velocity > shape. Our study suggests that scaling alone is insufficient for video generation models to uncover fundamental physical laws, despite its role in Sora's broader success.

However, our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods.

| **[Multi-modal Generative AI: Multi-modal LLMs, Diffusions and the Unification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14993v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry. Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we present several challenging future research directions which may contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Solving Inverse Problems using Diffusion with Iterative Colored Renoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17468v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaging inverse problems can be solved in an unsupervised manner using pre-trained diffusion models, but doing so requires approximating the gradient of the measurement-conditional score function in the diffusion reverse process. We show that the approximations produced by existing methods are relatively poor, especially early in the reverse process, and so we propose a new approach that iteratively reestimates and "renoises" the estimate several times per diffusion step. This iterative approach, which we call Fast Iterative REnoising (FIRE), injects colored noise that is shaped to ensure that the pre-trained diffusion model always sees white noise, in accordance with how it was trained. We then embed FIRE into the DDIM reverse process and show that the resulting "DDfire" offers state-of-the-art accuracy and runtime on several linear inverse problems, as well as phase retrieval. Our implementation is at https://github.com/matt-bendel/DDfire</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion of complex contagions is shaped by a trade-off between reach and reinforcement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07907v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How does social network structure amplify or stifle behavior diffusion? Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, it should spread more on random networks which avoid such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks spread behavior better than random networks. Using simulations and analytical methods, we identify precise boundaries in the parameter space where one network type outperforms the other or they perform equally. We find that, in most cases, random networks spread behavior as far or farther than clustered networks, even when social reinforcement increases adoption. Although we find that probabilistic, socially reinforced behaviors can spread farther on clustered networks in some cases, this is not the dominant pattern. Clustered networks are even less advantageous when individuals remain influential for longer after adopting, have more neighbors, or need more neighbors before social reinforcement takes effect. Under such conditions, clustering tends to help only when adoption is nearly deterministic, which is not representative of socially reinforced behaviors more generally. Clustered networks outperform random networks by a 5% margin in only 22% of the parameter space under its most favorable conditions. This pattern reflects a fundamental tradeoff: random ties enhance reach, while clustered ties enhance social reinforcement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Step Latent Diffusion for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07878v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast, and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models -- which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project website https://tianfwang.github.io/slurpp/.</p></details> |  |
| **[PWD: Prior-Guided and Wavelet-Enhanced Diffusion Model for Limited-Angle CT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05317v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models have received increasing attention in medical imaging, particularly in limited-angle computed tomography (LACT). Standard diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT, and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference, the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory, allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain, effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and 10% gain in SSIM.</p></details> |  |
| **[A preconditioned boundary value method for advection-diffusion equations with half Laplacian via spectrum doubling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07717v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study an advection-diffusion equation that involves a half-Laplacian operator derived from the Riesz fractional Laplacian, combined with a differential operator \(\mathcal{L}\). By applying the half-Laplacian operator $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ on both sides of the equation and using the relationship between the Hilbert transform and $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, we reformulate the problem as a second-order damped Cauchy problem and then convert it into an equivalent first-order system. This \textit{spectrum doubling} (SD) reformulation applies the half-Laplacian only once to the initial condition, thereby eliminating the need to evaluate singular integrals during the time evolution and reducing truncation-related numerical errors. For the resulting SD system, we show that standard time-stepping schemes can lose stability because of the backward-diffusion term. To address this, we adopt Boundary Value Methods (BVMs), which yield unconditional stability and second-order accuracy. We present eigenvalue-based stability criteria, error estimates, and an efficient block formulation to solve the resulting large linear systems. To further enhance computational efficiency, we propose a parallel preconditioned iterative solver. Numerical experiments confirm the second-order convergences in both time and space, even under strong advection or for complex fractional Schr\"odinger-type problems, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

In addition, labeling requires costly, time-intensive manual image annotation by clinical experts. To overcome these challenges, synthetic medical data generation offers a promising solution. Generative AI (GenAI), employing generative deep learning models, has proven effective at producing realistic synthetic images. This study proposes a novel mask-guided GenAI approach using diffusion models to generate synthetic fetal head ultrasound images paired with segmentation masks. These synthetic pairs augment real datasets for supervised fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our results show that the synthetic data captures real image features effectively, and this approach reaches state-of-the-art fetal head segmentation, especially when trained with a limited number of real image-mask pairs. In particular, the segmentation reaches Dice Scores of 94.66\% and 94.38\% using a handful of ultrasound images from the Spanish and African cohorts, respectively.

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches by both normalizing channels activations and applying Hadamard transforms to effectively mitigate outliers and enable aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 6 Figures |

In this paper, we propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter, a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view hair transfer.

Under minimal assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite using a model of comparable size.

Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation (DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation, while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions.

| **[Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization for Diffusion Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07510v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Diffusion Augmented Retrieval: A Training-Free Approach to Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15379v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive Text-to-image retrieval (I-TIR) is an important enabler for a wide range of state-of-the-art services in domains such as e-commerce and education. However, current methods rely on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which are costly to train and update, and exhibit poor generalizability. This latter issue is of particular concern, as: 1) finetuning narrows the pretrained distribution of MLLMs, thereby reducing generalizability; and 2) I-TIR introduces increasing query diversity and complexity. As a result, I-TIR solutions are highly likely to encounter queries and images not well represented in any training dataset. To address this, we propose leveraging Diffusion Models (DMs) for text-to-image mapping, to avoid finetuning MLLMs while preserving robust performance on complex queries. Specifically, we introduce Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a framework that generates multiple intermediate representations via LLM-based dialogue refinements and DMs, producing a richer depiction of the user's information needs. This augmented representation facilitates more accurate identification of semantically and visually related images. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that for simple queries, DAR achieves results on par with finetuned I-TIR models, yet without incurring their tuning overhead. Moreover, as queries become more complex through additional conversational turns, DAR surpasses finetuned I-TIR models by up to 7.61% in Hits@10 after ten turns, illustrating its improved generalization for more intricate queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept Unlearning by Modeling Key Steps of Diffusion Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06526v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion, which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU) method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally, KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's generative capabilities. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Concept Erasure for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using Training-Free Gated Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12356v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning based concept erasing has demonstrated promising results in preventing generation of harmful contents from text-to-image diffusion models by removing target concepts while preserving remaining concepts. To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method (PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e., no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality metrics and enhances downstream perception models.

| **[MODA: A Unified 3D Diffusion Framework for Multi-Task Target-Aware Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07201v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional molecular generators based on diffusion models can now reach near-crystallographic accuracy, yet they remain fragmented across tasks. SMILES-only inputs, two-stage pretrain-finetune pipelines, and one-task-one-model practices hinder stereochemical fidelity, task alignment, and zero-shot transfer. We introduce MODA, a diffusion framework that unifies fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration with a Bayesian mask scheduler. During training, a contiguous spatial fragment is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry. Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but trails in novelty and binding affinity. Zero-shot de novo design and lead-optimisation tests confirm stable negative Vina scores and high improvement rates without force-field refinement. These results demonstrate that a single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage workflows for structure-based molecular design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Multimodal Understanding via Stable Diffusion as a Task-Aware Feature Extractor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07106v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding, particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional reasoning.

This paper introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models (image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure under $1,000 USD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Evaluation of the Accuracy of Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems with Gaussian Data Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07008v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Used as priors for Bayesian inverse problems, diffusion models have recently attracted considerable attention in the literature. Their flexibility and high variance enable them to generate multiple solutions for a given task, such as inpainting, super-resolution, and deblurring. However, several unresolved questions remain about how well they perform. In this article, we investigate the accuracy of these models when applied to a Gaussian data distribution for deblurring. Within this constrained context, we are able to precisely analyze the discrepancy between the theoretical resolution of inverse problems and their resolution obtained using diffusion models by computing the exact Wasserstein distance between the distribution of the diffusion model sampler and the ideal distribution of solutions to the inverse problem. Our findings allow for the comparison of different algorithms from the literature.</p></details> |  |

Although existing works have investigated imputing the missing regions using deep generative models, it remains unclear how to specifically utilize additional information from paired multi-modality data and whether this can enhance the imputation quality and be useful for downstream tractography. To fill this gap, we propose a novel framework for imputing dMRI scans in the incomplete part of the FOV by integrating the learned diffusion features in the acquired part of the FOV to the complete brain anatomical structure. We hypothesize that by this design the proposed framework can enhance the imputation performance of the dMRI scans and therefore be useful for repairing whole-brain tractography in corrupted dMRI scans with incomplete FOV. We tested our framework on two cohorts from different sites with a total of 96 subjects and compared it with a baseline imputation method that treats the information from T1w and dMRI scans equally. The proposed framework achieved significant improvements in imputation performance, as demonstrated by angular correlation coefficient (p < 1E-5), and in downstream tractography accuracy, as demonstrated by Dice score (p < 0.01). Results suggest that the proposed framework improved imputation performance in dMRI scans by specifically utilizing additional information from paired multi-modality data, compared with the baseline method. The imputation achieved by the proposed framework enhances whole brain tractography, and therefore reduces the uncertainty when analyzing bundles associated with neurodegenerative.</p></details> |  |

The analysis is based on a mathematical model developed by B. Detmann, C. Gavioli, and P. Krej\v{c}\'i, in which the effects of gravity are included in a novel way. The model consists of a nonlinear partial differential equation describing both the diffusion and the gravitational transport of water. Although analytical solutions can be obtained for some special cases, only numerical solutions are available in more general situations.

The likelihood is well-defined and tractable by the infinite-dimensional Girsanov theorem, and the posterior distribution is analysed in the growing domain asymptotic. Based on a Gaussian wavelet prior, the contraction of the posterior distribution around the truth at the minimax optimal rate is proved. The analysis of the posterior distribution is complemented by a semiparametric Bernstein--von Mises theorem. The proofs rely on the sub-Gaussian concentration of spatio-temporal averages of transformations of the SPDE, which is derived by combining the Clark-Ocone formula with bounds for the derivatives of the (marginal) densities of the SPDE.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffSpectra: Molecular Structure Elucidation from Spectra using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06853v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a foundational problem in chemistry, with profound implications for compound identification, synthesis, and drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced retrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits generalization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers both 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using diffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional generation process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates topological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer, a transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral dependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact structures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through sampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight the effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the challenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.</p></details> |  |

While extensive approaches have been proposed to erase unwanted concepts without requiring retraining from scratch, they inadvertently degrade performance on normal generation tasks. In this work, we propose Interpret then Deactivate (ItD), a novel framework to enable precise concept removal in T2I diffusion models while preserving overall performance. ItD first employs a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to interpret each concept as a combination of multiple features. By permanently deactivating the specific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a zero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target concepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we demonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without requiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity identities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's effectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal concept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial prompts designed to circumvent content filters.

It is a established knowledge that nonlinear ac.f.'s are required for learning nonlinear datasets. This work shows that smoothness and gradient properties of the ac.f. further impact the performance of large neural networks in terms of overfitting and sensitivity to model parameters. Smooth but vanishing-gradient ac.f.'s such as ELU or SiLU have limited performance and non-smooth ac.f.'s such as RELU and Leaky-RELU further impart discontinuity in the trained model. Improved performance is demonstrated with a smooth "Leaky Exponential Linear Unit", with non-zero gradient that can be trained. A novel diffusion-loss metric is also proposed to gauge the performance of the trained models in terms of overfitting.</p></details> |  |

However, in high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset (CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation. Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988. This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive future research in industrial AI.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing methods rely on behavior cloning with supervised historical trajectories, limiting their 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal awareness. Consequently, these methods struggle to capture the 3D structures and 4D spatiotemporal relationships necessary for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4), a novel visual imitation learning method that incorporates spatiotemporal awareness into diffusion-based policies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on trajectory cloning, DP4 leverages a dynamic Gaussian world model to guide the learning of 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal perceptions from interactive environments. Our method constructs the current 3D scene from a single-view RGB-D observation and predicts the future 3D scene, optimizing trajectory generation by explicitly modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments across 17 simulation tasks with 173 variants and 3 real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that the 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4) outperforms baseline methods, improving the average simulation task success rate by 16.4% (Adroit), 14% (DexArt), and 6.45% (RLBench), and the average real-world robotic task success rate by 8.6%.</p></details> |  |

In particular, diverse action spaces across different end-effectors create barriers for cross-embodiment learning and skill transfer. We address this challenge through diffusion policies learned in a latent action space that unifies diverse end-effector actions. We first show that we can learn a semantically aligned latent action space for anthropomorphic robotic hands, a human hand, and a parallel jaw gripper using encoders trained with a contrastive loss. Second, we show that by using our proposed latent action space for co-training on manipulation data from different end-effectors, we can utilize a single policy for multi-robot control and obtain up to 25% improved manipulation success rates, indicating successful skill transfer despite a significant embodiment gap. Our approach using latent cross-embodiment policies presents a new method to unify different action spaces across embodiments, enabling efficient multi-robot control and data sharing across robot setups. This unified representation significantly reduces the need for extensive data collection for each new robot morphology, accelerates generalization across embodiments, and ultimately facilitates more scalable and efficient robotic learning.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework, leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap. Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7% improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

In this paper, we present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

While previous approaches struggle with coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct, fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy. In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.</p></details> |  |

Combining with semantic communications, diffusion models are used for tasks such as denoising, data reconstruction, and content generation. However, existing diffusion-based generative models do not consider the stringent bandwidth limitation, which limits its application in wireless communication. This paper introduces a diffusion-driven semantic communication framework with advanced VAE-based compression for bandwidth-constrained generative model. Our designed architecture utilizes the diffusion model, where the signal transmission process through the wireless channel acts as the forward process in diffusion. To reduce bandwidth requirements, we incorporate a downsampling module and a paired upsampling module based on a variational auto-encoder with reparameterization at the receiver to ensure that the recovered features conform to the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we derive the loss function for our proposed system and evaluate its performance through comprehensive experiments. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in pixel-level metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and semantic metrics like learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). These enhancements are more profound regarding the compression rates and SNR compared to deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC).

Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called \emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior methods.

Nevertheless, since post-training quantization (PTQ) fails catastrophically at low-bit cases, quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential. Unfortunately, the wide range and time-varying activations in diffusion models sharply increase the complexity of quantization, making existing QAT methods inefficient. Equivalent scaling can effectively reduce activation range, but previous methods remain the overall quantization error unchanged. More critically, these methods significantly disrupt the original weight distribution, resulting in poor weight initialization and challenging convergence during QAT training. In this paper, we propose a novel QAT framework for diffusion models, called DilateQuant. Specifically, we propose Weight Dilation (WD) that maximally dilates the unsaturated in-channel weights to a constrained range through equivalent scaling. WD decreases the activation range while preserving the original weight range, which steadily reduces the quantization error and ensures model convergence. To further enhance accuracy and efficiency, we design a Temporal Parallel Quantizer (TPQ) to address the time-varying activations and introduce a Block-wise Knowledge Distillation (BKD) to reduce resource consumption in training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DilateQuant significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Although quantization paves a way for model compression and acceleration, existing methods face challenges in achieving low-bit quantization efficiently. In this paper, we identify imbalanced activation distributions as a primary source of quantization difficulty, and propose to adjust these distributions through weight finetuning to be more quantization-friendly. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting finetuning as a practical and reliable solution. Building on this approach, we further distinguish two critical types of quantized layers: those responsible for retaining essential temporal information and those particularly sensitive to bit-width reduction. By selectively finetuning these layers under both local and global supervision, we mitigate performance degradation while enhancing quantization efficiency. Our method demonstrates its efficacy across three high-resolution image generation tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance across multiple bit-width settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

However, current diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1) Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood. CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets, surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

However, one major challenge for this paradigm is the data heterogeneity issue, where biased data preferences across multiple clients, harming the model's convergence and performance. In this paper, we first introduce powerful diffusion models into the federated learning paradigm and show that diffusion representations are effective steers during federated training. To explore the possibility of using diffusion representations in handling data heterogeneity, we propose a novel diffusion-inspired Federated paradigm with Diffusion Representation Collaboration, termed FedDifRC, leveraging meaningful guidance of diffusion models to mitigate data heterogeneity. The key idea is to construct text-driven diffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to provide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence signals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the diffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive learning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency regularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising representations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In addition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying on any labeled data. We also provide a theoretical analysis for FedDifRC to ensure convergence under non-convex objectives. The experiments on different scenarios validate the effectiveness of FedDifRC and the efficiency of crucial components.</p></details> | 19 Pages, ICCV 2025 |

While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial prompts.</p></details> |  |

FL is particularly beneficial for distributed training of Diffusion Models (DMs), which are high-quality image generators that require diverse data. However, challenges such as high communication costs and data heterogeneity persist in training DMs similar to training Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. Limited research has addressed these issues in FL environments. To address this gap and challenges, we introduce a novel approach, FedPhD, designed to efficiently train DMs in FL environments. FedPhD leverages Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation and selection policy to tackle data heterogeneity while reducing communication costs. The distributed structured pruning of FedPhD enhances computational efficiency and reduces model storage requirements in clients. Our experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedPhD achieves high model performance regarding Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores while reducing communication costs by up to $88\%$. FedPhD outperforms baseline methods achieving at least a $34\%$ improvement in FID, while utilizing only $56\%$ of the total computation and communication resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Mitigating Multi-Sequence 3D Prostate MRI Data Scarcity through Domain Adaptation using Locally-Trained Latent Diffusion Models for Prostate Cancer Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06384v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) could mitigate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical image interpretation. The recent CCELLA LDM improved prostate cancer detection performance using synthetic MRI for classifier training but was limited to the axial T2-weighted (AxT2) sequence, did not investigate inter-institutional domain shift, and prioritized radiology over histopathology outcomes. We propose CCELLA++ to address these limitations and improve clinical utility. Methods: CCELLA++ expands CCELLA for simultaneous biparametric prostate MRI (bpMRI) generation, including the AxT2, high b-value diffusion series (HighB) and apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). Domain adaptation was investigated by pretraining classifiers on real or LDM-generated synthetic data from an internal institution, followed with fine-tuning on progressively smaller fractions of an out-of-distribution, external dataset. Results: CCELLA++ improved 3D FID for HighB and ADC but not AxT2 (0.013, 0.012, 0.063 respectively) sequences compared to CCELLA (0.060). Classifier pretraining with CCELLA++ bpMRI outperformed real bpMRI in AP and AUC for all domain adaptation scenarios. CCELLA++ pretraining achieved highest classifier performance below 50% (n=665) external dataset volume. Conclusion: Synthetic bpMRI generated by our method can improve downstream classifier generalization and performance beyond real bpMRI or CCELLA-generated AxT2-only images. Future work should seek to quantify medical image sample quality, balance multi-sequence LDM training, and condition the LDM with additional information. Significance: The proposed CCELLA++ LDM can generate synthetic bpMRI that outperforms real data for domain adaptation with a limited target institution dataset.

| **[Rethinking Diffusion for Text-Driven Human Motion Generation: Redundant Representations, Evaluation, and Masked Autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16575v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since 2023, Vector Quantization (VQ)-based discrete generation methods have rapidly dominated human motion generation, primarily surpassing diffusion-based continuous generation methods in standard performance metrics. However, VQ-based methods have inherent limitations. Representing continuous motion data as limited discrete tokens leads to inevitable information loss, reduces the diversity of generated motions, and restricts their ability to function effectively as motion priors or generation guidance. In contrast, the continuous space generation nature of diffusion-based methods makes them well-suited to address these limitations and with even potential for model scalability. In this work, we systematically investigate why current VQ-based methods perform well and explore the limitations of existing diffusion-based methods from the perspective of motion data representation and distribution. Drawing on these insights, we preserve the inherent strengths of a diffusion-based human motion generation model and gradually optimize it with inspiration from VQ-based approaches. Our approach introduces a human motion diffusion model enabled to perform masked autoregression, optimized with a reformed data representation and distribution. Additionally, we propose a more robust evaluation method to assess different approaches. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate our method outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performances.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Normalizing Diffusion Kernels with Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06161v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself, with applications to shape analysis and matching.</p></details> | 33 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Prompt-Free Conditional Diffusion for Multi-object Image Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06146v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images, resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unconditional Diffusion for Generative Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06121v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, known for their generative ability to simulate data creation through noise-adding and denoising processes, have emerged as a promising approach for building generative recommenders. To incorporate user history for personalization, existing methods typically adopt a conditional diffusion framework, where the reverse denoising process of reconstructing items from noise is modified to be conditioned on the user history. However, this design may fail to fully utilize historical information, as it gets distracted by the need to model the "item $\leftrightarrow$ noise" translation. This motivates us to reformulate the diffusion process for sequential recommendation in an unconditional manner, treating user history (instead of noise) as the endpoint of the forward diffusion process (i.e., the starting point of the reverse process), rather than as a conditional input. This formulation allows for exclusive focus on modeling the "item $\leftrightarrow$ history" translation. To this end, we introduce Brownian Bridge Diffusion Recommendation (BBDRec). By leveraging a Brownian bridge process, BBDRec enforces a structured noise addition and denoising mechanism, ensuring that the trajectories are constrained towards a specific endpoint -- user history, rather than noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate BBDRec's effectiveness in enhancing sequential recommendation performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/baiyimeng/BBDRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScoreAdv: Score-based Targeted Generation of Natural Adversarial Examples via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06078v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.</p></details> |  |

In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.</p></details> |  |

Although existing methods can guide generation beyond text prompts, the challenge of effectively combining multiple conditional inputs while maintaining consistency with all of them remains unsolved. To address this, we introduce UniCombine, a DiT-based multi-conditional controllable generative framework capable of handling any combination of conditions, including but not limited to text prompts, spatial maps, and subject images. Specifically, we introduce a novel Conditional MMDiT Attention mechanism and incorporate a trainable LoRA module to build both the training-free and training-based versions. Additionally, we propose a new pipeline to construct SubjectSpatial200K, the first dataset designed for multi-conditional generative tasks covering both the subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditions.

| **[TextPixs: Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware Attention and OCR-Guided Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06033v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets, such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).</p></details> | 30 pages |

Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Moreover, in the case of surface diffusion we present structure-preserving higher-order isoparametric finite element methods. In addition to being unconditionally stable, these also conserve the enclosed volume. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the higher-order spatial accuracy, the unconditional energy stability, the volume preservation for surface diffusion, and the good mesh quality.</p></details> | 29 pages, 19 figures |

This paper tackles the challenging yet most impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image, as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones, necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios.

To address this, we introduce SkeletonDiffusion, a latent diffusion model that embeds an explicit inductive bias on the human body within its architecture and training. Our model is trained with a novel nonisotropic Gaussian diffusion formulation that aligns with the natural kinematic structure of the human skeleton. Results show that our approach outperforms conventional isotropic alternatives, consistently generating realistic predictions while avoiding artifacts such as limb distortion. Additionally, we identify a limitation in commonly used diversity metrics, which may inadvertently favor models that produce inconsistent limb lengths within the same sequence.

From a data-centric perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a "synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Iintr...</summary><p>Iintroduces D2C: a novel framework for diffusion dataset condensation</p></details> |

Inspired by the motion of particles in physics, we propose a universal framework for large-scale multi-objective optimization based on particle drift and diffusion to solve these challenges in this paper. This framework innovatively divides the optimization process into three sub-stages: two coarse-tuning sub-stages and one fine-tuning sub-stage. Different strategies of drift-diffusion operations are performed on the guiding solutions according to the current sub-stage, ingeniously simulating the movement of particles under diverse environmental conditions. Finally, representative evolutionary algorithms are embedded into the proposed framework, and their effectiveness are evaluated through comparative experiments on various large-scale multi-objective problems with 1000 to 5000 decision variables. Moreover, comparative algorithms are conducted on neural network training problems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the practical problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the framework proposed in this paper significantly enhances the performance of convergence and diversity of MOEAs, and improves the computational efficiency of algorithms in solving large-scale multi-objective optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10482v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[Towards Stabilized and Efficient Diffusion Transformers through Long-Skip-Connections with Spectral Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17616v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high fidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish Long-Skip-Connections as critical architectural components for stable and efficient diffusion transformers. Codes are provided in the https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Skip-DiT.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[ReviveDiff: A Universal Diffusion Model for Restoring Images in Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18932v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images captured in challenging environments--such as nighttime, smoke, rainy weather, and underwater--often suffer from significant degradation, resulting in a substantial loss of visual quality. The effective restoration of these degraded images is critical for the subsequent vision tasks. While many existing approaches have successfully incorporated specific priors for individual tasks, these tailored solutions limit their applicability to other degradations. In this work, we propose a universal network architecture, dubbed ``ReviveDiff'', which can address various degradations and bring images back to life by enhancing and restoring their quality. Our approach is inspired by the observation that, unlike degradation caused by movement or electronic issues, quality degradation under adverse conditions primarily stems from natural media (such as fog, water, and low luminance), which generally preserves the original structures of objects. To restore the quality of such images, we leveraged the latest advancements in diffusion models and developed ReviveDiff to restore image quality from both macro and micro levels across some key factors determining image quality, such as sharpness, distortion, noise level, dynamic range, and color accuracy. We rigorously evaluated ReviveDiff on seven benchmark datasets covering five types of degrading conditions: Rainy, Underwater, Low-light, Smoke, and Nighttime Hazy. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReviveDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Diffusion Policies with Projective Geometric Algebra for Efficient Robot Manipulation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05695v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have become increasingly popular in robot learning due to their reliable convergence in motion generation tasks. At a high level, these policies learn to transform noisy action trajectories into effective ones, conditioned on observations. However, each time such a model is trained in a robotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations and operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to ground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating geometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this redundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we introduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical framework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric inductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it provides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric primitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks to reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable operations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that incorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging its E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts a hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action decoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising process. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task performance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but also achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model compared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiON-LoRA: Rethinking LoRA Fusion to Unify Controllable Spatial and Temporal Generation for Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05678v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations. Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT) to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos, unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal training data.

| **[Integrating Diffusion-based Multi-task Learning with Online Reinforcement Learning for Robust Quadruped Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05674v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has highlighted the powerful capabilities of imitation learning in robotics. Leveraging generative models, particularly diffusion models, these approaches offer notable advantages such as strong multi-task generalization, effective language conditioning, and high sample efficiency. While their application has been successful in manipulation tasks, their use in legged locomotion remains relatively underexplored, mainly due to compounding errors that affect stability and difficulties in task transition under limited data. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in legged robot control in the past years, providing valuable insights to address these challenges. In this work, we propose DMLoco, a diffusion-based framework for quadruped robots that integrates multi-task pretraining with online PPO finetuning to enable language-conditioned control and robust task transitions. Our approach first pretrains the policy on a diverse multi-task dataset using diffusion models, enabling language-guided execution of various skills. Then, it finetunes the policy in simulation to ensure robustness and stable task transition during real-world deployment. By utilizing Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for efficient sampling and TensorRT for optimized deployment, our policy runs onboard at 50Hz, offering a scalable and efficient solution for adaptive, language-guided locomotion on resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling and Reversing Brain Lesions Using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05670v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain. This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize multiple lesioned brain images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-guided Complex Diffusion Model for PolSAR Image Classification in Contourlet Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05666v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform, which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically, the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components. During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation. Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.</p></details> |  |
| **[MALT Diffusion: Memory-Augmented Latent Transformers for Any-Length Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12632v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are successful for synthesizing high-quality videos but are limited to generating short clips (e.g., 2-10 seconds). Synthesizing sustained footage (e.g. over minutes) still remains an open research question. In this paper, we propose MALT Diffusion (using Memory-Augmented Latent Transformers), a new diffusion model specialized for long video generation. MALT Diffusion (or just MALT) handles long videos by subdividing them into short segments and doing segment-level autoregressive generation. To achieve this, we first propose recurrent attention layers that encode multiple segments into a compact memory latent vector; by maintaining this memory vector over time, MALT is able to condition on it and continuously generate new footage based on a long temporal context. We also present several training techniques that enable the model to generate frames over a long horizon with consistent quality and minimal degradation. We validate the effectiveness of MALT through experiments on long video benchmarks. We first perform extensive analysis of MALT in long-contextual understanding capability and stability using popular long video benchmarks. For example, MALT achieves an FVD score of 220.4 on 128-frame video generation on UCF-101, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of 648.4. Finally, we explore MALT's capabilities in a text-to-video generation setting and show that it can produce long videos compared with recent techniques for long text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop on AI for Content Creation (Oral)</p></details> |

While recent learning-based methods have demonstrated effectiveness, most of them assume ideal, noise-free measurements and fail to address the impact of measurement noise. To overcome this limitation, we treat LACT as a sinogram inpainting task and propose a diffusion-based framework that completes missing angular views using a Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (MR-SDE) formulation. To improve robustness under realistic noise, we propose RNSD$^+$, a novel noise-aware rectification mechanism that explicitly models inference-time uncertainty, enabling reliable and robust reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses baseline models in data consistency and perceptual quality, and generalizes well across varying noise intensity and acquisition scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), Workshop</p></details> |

This paper presents FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and (3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000 paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic images exhibit distinct spectral signatures in the 0.1--0.4 normalised frequency range, providing theoretical foundation for our approach.

| **[ADMC: Attention-based Diffusion Model for Missing Modalities Feature Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05624v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Supervised Defect Detection via Conditional Diffusion and CLIP-Guided Noise Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05588v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms, suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision, low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality inspection scenarios.

| **[A Malliavin calculus approach to score functions in diffusion generative models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05550v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we derive an exact, closed form, expression for the score function for a broad class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the development of score-based diffusion generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Walks with Tweedie: A Unified View of Score-Based Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18702v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a concise derivation for several influential score-based diffusion models that relies on only a few textbook results. Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for generating realistic, synthetic signals -- particularly natural images -- and often play a role in state-of-the-art algorithms for inverse problems in image processing. While these algorithms are often surprisingly simple, the theory behind them is not, and multiple complex theoretical justifications exist in the literature. Here, we provide a simple and largely self-contained theoretical justification for score-based diffusion models that is targeted towards the signal processing community. This approach leads to generic algorithmic templates for training and generating samples with diffusion models. We show that several influential diffusion models correspond to particular choices within these templates and demonstrate that alternative, more straightforward algorithmic choices can provide comparable results. This approach has the added benefit of enabling conditional sampling without any likelihood approximation.</p></details> |  |

Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and generate more realistic images. HDM essentially is a DDPM that incorporates an attention mechanism between pixels. In HDM, the discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).</p></details> |  |
