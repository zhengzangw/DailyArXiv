However, existing methods primarily focus on single human animation and struggle with multi-stream audio inputs, facing incorrect binding problems between audio and persons. Additionally, they exhibit limitations in instruction-following capabilities. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel task: Multi-Person Conversational Video Generation, and introduce a new framework, MultiTalk, to address the challenges during multi-person generation. Specifically, for audio injection, we investigate several schemes and propose the Label Rotary Position Embedding (L-RoPE) method to resolve the audio and person binding problem. Furthermore, during training, we observe that partial parameter training and multi-task training are crucial for preserving the instruction-following ability of the base model. MultiTalk achieves superior performance compared to other methods on several datasets, including talking head, talking body, and multi-person datasets, demonstrating the powerful generation capabilities of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://meigen-ai.github.io/multi-talk Github: https://github.com/MeiGen-AI/MultiTalk</p></details> |
| **[Inference-Time Scaling for Flow Models via Stochastic Generation and Rollover Budget Forcing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19385v4)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://flow-inference-time-scaling.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Hunyuan-Game: Industrial-grade Intelligent Game Creation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14135v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent game creation represents a transformative advancement in game development, utilizing generative artificial intelligence to dynamically generate and enhance game content. Despite notable progress in generative models, the comprehensive synthesis of high-quality game assets, including both images and videos, remains a challenging frontier. To create high-fidelity game content that simultaneously aligns with player preferences and significantly boosts designer efficiency, we present Hunyuan-Game, an innovative project designed to revolutionize intelligent game production. Hunyuan-Game encompasses two primary branches: image generation and video generation. The image generation component is built upon a vast dataset comprising billions of game images, leading to the development of a group of customized image generation models tailored for game scenarios: (1) General Text-to-Image Generation. (2) Game Visual Effects Generation, involving text-to-effect and reference image-based game visual effect generation. (3) Transparent Image Generation for characters, scenes, and game visual effects. (4) Game Character Generation based on sketches, black-and-white images, and white models. The video generation component is built upon a comprehensive dataset of millions of game and anime videos, leading to the development of five core algorithmic models, each targeting critical pain points in game development and having robust adaptation to diverse game video scenarios: (1) Image-to-Video Generation. (2) 360 A/T Pose Avatar Video Synthesis. (3) Dynamic Illustration Generation. (4) Generative Video Super-Resolution. (5) Interactive Game Video Generation. These image and video generation models not only exhibit high-level aesthetic expression but also deeply integrate domain-specific knowledge, establishing a systematic understanding of diverse game and anime art styles.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenS2V-Nexus: A Detailed Benchmark and Million-Scale Dataset for Subject-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20292v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subject-to-Video (S2V) generation aims to create videos that faithfully incorporate reference content, providing enhanced flexibility in the production of videos. To establish the infrastructure for S2V generation, we propose OpenS2V-Nexus, consisting of (i) OpenS2V-Eval, a fine-grained benchmark, and (ii) OpenS2V-5M, a million-scale dataset. In contrast to existing S2V benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data. Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16 representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and Dataset: https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/OpenS2V-Nexus</p></details> |
| **[Q-VDiT: Towards Accurate Quantization and Distillation of Video-Generation Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22167v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers (DiT) have demonstrated exceptional performance in video generation. However, their large number of parameters and high computational complexity limit their deployment on edge devices. Quantization can reduce storage requirements and accelerate inference by lowering the bit-width of model parameters. Yet, existing quantization methods for image generation models do not generalize well to video generation tasks. We identify two primary challenges: the loss of information during quantization and the misalignment between optimization objectives and the unique requirements of video generation. To address these challenges, we present Q-VDiT, a quantization framework specifically designed for video DiT models. From the quantization perspective, we propose the Token-aware Quantization Estimator (TQE), which compensates for quantization errors in both the token and feature dimensions. From the optimization perspective, we introduce Temporal Maintenance Distillation (TMD), which preserves the spatiotemporal correlations between frames and enables the optimization of each frame with respect to the overall video context. Our W3A6 Q-VDiT achieves a scene consistency of 23.40, setting a new benchmark and outperforming current state-of-the-art quantization methods by 1.9$\times$. Code will be available at https://github.com/cantbebetter2/Q-VDiT.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2025 |
| **[FaceEditTalker: Interactive Talking Head Generation with Facial Attribute Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22141v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in audio-driven talking head generation have achieved impressive results in lip synchronization and emotional expression. However, they largely overlook the crucial task of facial attribute editing. This capability is crucial for achieving deep personalization and expanding the range of practical applications, including user-tailored digital avatars, engaging online education content, and brand-specific digital customer service. In these key domains, the flexible adjustment of visual attributes-such as hairstyle, accessories, and subtle facial features is essential for aligning with user preferences, reflecting diverse brand identities, and adapting to varying contextual demands. In this paper, we present FaceEditTalker, a unified framework that enables controllable facial attribute manipulation while generating high-quality, audio-synchronized talking head videos. Our method consists of two key components: an image feature space editing module, which extracts semantic and detail features and allows flexible control over attributes like expression, hairstyle, and accessories; and an audio-driven video generation module, which fuses these edited features with audio-guided facial landmarks to drive a diffusion-based generator. This design ensures temporal coherence, visual fidelity, and identity preservation across frames. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in lip-sync accuracy, video quality, and attribute controllability.

| **[VideoAnydoor: High-fidelity Video Object Insertion with Precise Motion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01427v4)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in video generation, inserting a given object into videos remains a challenging task. The difficulty lies in preserving the appearance details of the reference object and accurately modeling coherent motions at the same time. In this paper, we propose VideoAnydoor, a zero-shot video object insertion framework with high-fidelity detail preservation and precise motion control. Starting from a text-to-video model, we utilize an ID extractor to inject the global identity and leverage a box sequence to control the overall motion. To preserve the detailed appearance and meanwhile support fine-grained motion control, we design a pixel warper. It takes the reference image with arbitrary key-points and the corresponding key-point trajectories as inputs. It warps the pixel details according to the trajectories and fuses the warped features with the diffusion U-Net, thus improving detail preservation and supporting users in manipulating the motion trajectories. In addition, we propose a training strategy involving both videos and static images with a weighted loss to enhance insertion quality. VideoAnydoor demonstrates significant superiority over existing methods and naturally supports various downstream applications (e.g., talking head generation, video virtual try-on, multi-region editing) without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH2025 Project page: https://videoanydoor.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[LatentMove: Towards Complex Human Movement Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22046v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-to-video (I2V) generation seeks to produce realistic motion sequences from a single reference image. Although recent methods exhibit strong temporal consistency, they often struggle when dealing with complex, non-repetitive human movements, leading to unnatural deformations. To tackle this issue, we present LatentMove, a DiT-based framework specifically tailored for highly dynamic human animation. Our architecture incorporates a conditional control branch and learnable face/body tokens to preserve consistency as well as fine-grained details across frames. We introduce Complex-Human-Videos (CHV), a dataset featuring diverse, challenging human motions designed to benchmark the robustness of I2V systems. We also introduce two metrics to assess the flow and silhouette consistency of generated videos with their ground truth. Experimental results indicate that LatentMove substantially improves human animation quality--particularly when handling rapid, intricate movements--thereby pushing the boundaries of I2V generation. The code, the CHV dataset, and the evaluation metrics will be available at https://github.com/ --.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[PanoWan: Lifting Diffusion Video Generation Models to 360° with Latitude/Longitude-aware Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22016v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic video generation enables immersive 360{\deg} content creation, valuable in applications that demand scene-consistent world exploration. However, existing panoramic video generation models struggle to leverage pre-trained generative priors from conventional text-to-video models for high-quality and diverse panoramic videos generation, due to limited dataset scale and the gap in spatial feature representations. In this paper, we introduce PanoWan to effectively lift pre-trained text-to-video models to the panoramic domain, equipped with minimal modules. PanoWan employs latitude-aware sampling to avoid latitudinal distortion, while its rotated semantic denoising and padded pixel-wise decoding ensure seamless transitions at longitude boundaries. To provide sufficient panoramic videos for learning these lifted representations, we contribute PanoVid, a high-quality panoramic video dataset with captions and diverse scenarios. Consequently, PanoWan achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and demonstrates robustness for zero-shot downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SageAttention2++: A More Efficient Implementation of SageAttention2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21136v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows quadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing quantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8 Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++ achieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning World Models for Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21996v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational world models must be both interactive and preserve spatiotemporal coherence for effective future planning with action choices. However, present models for long video generation have limited inherent world modeling capabilities due to two main challenges: compounding errors and insufficient memory mechanisms. We enhance image-to-video models with interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context learning capabilities of current video models. Our work illuminates the fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[HDRSDR-VQA: A Subjective Video Quality Dataset for HDR and SDR Comparative Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21831v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce HDRSDR-VQA, a large-scale video quality assessment dataset designed to facilitate comparative analysis between High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content under realistic viewing conditions. The dataset comprises 960 videos generated from 54 diverse source sequences, each presented in both HDR and SDR formats across nine distortion levels. To obtain reliable perceptual quality scores, we conducted a comprehensive subjective study involving 145 participants and six consumer-grade HDR-capable televisions. A total of over 22,000 pairwise comparisons were collected and scaled into Just-Objectionable-Difference (JOD) scores. Unlike prior datasets that focus on a single dynamic range format or use limited evaluation protocols, HDRSDR-VQA enables direct content-level comparison between HDR and SDR versions, supporting detailed investigations into when and why one format is preferred over the other. The open-sourced part of the dataset is publicly available to support further research in video quality assessment, content-adaptive streaming, and perceptual model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Adversarial Post-Training for One-Step Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08316v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation, but their iterative generation process is slow and expansive. While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Before You Diffuse: LLMs-Guided Physics-Aware Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21653v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their great capability in generating visually-pleasing results, while synthesizing the correct physical effects in generated videos remains challenging. The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to explicitly reason a comprehensive physical context from the text prompt and use it to guide the generation. To incorporate physical context into the diffusion model, we leverage a Multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a supervisory signal and introduce a set of novel training objectives that jointly enforce physical correctness and semantic consistency with the input text. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

| **[VideoMarkBench: Benchmarking Robustness of Video Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21620v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of video generative models has led to a surge in highly realistic synthetic videos, raising ethical concerns related to disinformation and copyright infringement. Recently, video watermarking has been proposed as a mitigation strategy by embedding invisible marks into AI-generated videos to enable subsequent detection. However, the robustness of existing video watermarking methods against both common and adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMarkBench, the first systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of video watermarks under watermark removal and watermark forgery attacks. Our study encompasses a unified dataset generated by three state-of-the-art video generative models, across three video styles, incorporating four watermarking methods and seven aggregation strategies used during detection. We comprehensively evaluate 12 types of perturbations under white-box, black-box, and no-box threat models. Our findings reveal significant vulnerabilities in current watermarking approaches and highlight the urgent need for more robust solutions. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhengyuan-jiang/VideoMarkBench.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we focus on a commonly used yet underexplored cinematic technique known as Frame In and Frame Out. Specifically, starting from image-to-video generation, users can control the objects in the image to naturally leave the scene or provide breaking new identity references to enter the scene, guided by user-specified motion trajectory. To support this task, we introduce a new dataset curated semi-automatically, a comprehensive evaluation protocol targeting this setting, and an efficient identity-preserving motion-controllable video Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Vision from EEG Brain Recordings: How much does EEG know?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21385v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing and understanding dynamic visual information (video) from brain EEG recordings is challenging due to the non-stationary nature of EEG signals, their low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the limited availability of EEG-Video stimulus datasets. Most recent studies have focused on reconstructing static images from EEG recordings. In this work, we propose a framework to reconstruct dynamic visual stimuli from EEG data and conduct an in-depth study of the information encoded in EEG signals. Our approach first trains a feature extraction network using a triplet-based contrastive learning strategy within an EEG-video generation framework. The extracted EEG features are then used for video synthesis with a modified StyleGAN-ADA, which incorporates temporal information as conditioning. Additionally, we analyze how different brain regions contribute to processing dynamic visual stimuli. Through several empirical studies, we evaluate the effectiveness of our framework and investigate how much dynamic visual information can be inferred from EEG signals. The inferences we derive through our extensive studies would be of immense value to future research on extracting visual dynamics from EEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minute-Long Videos with Dual Parallelisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21070v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based video diffusion models generate high-quality videos at scale but incur prohibitive processing latency and memory costs for long videos. To address this, we propose a novel distributed inference strategy, termed DualParal. The core idea is that, instead of generating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames and model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division faces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise levels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of original parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle this. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with progressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and layer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling asynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we incorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on each GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context, minimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we employ a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally consistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs without extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and infinitely long video generation. Applied to the latest diffusion transformer video generator, our method efficiently produces 1,025-frame videos with up to 6.54$\times$ lower latency and 1.48$\times$ lower memory cost on 8$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/DualParal-Project/DualParal</p></details> |
| **[RainFusion: Adaptive Video Generation Acceleration via Multi-Dimensional Visual Redundancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21036v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation using diffusion models is highly computationally intensive, with 3D attention in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models accounting for over 80\% of the total computational resources. In this work, we introduce {\bf RainFusion}, a novel training-free sparse attention method that exploits inherent sparsity nature in visual data to accelerate attention computation while preserving video quality. Specifically, we identify three unique sparse patterns in video generation attention calculations--Spatial Pattern, Temporal Pattern and Textural Pattern. The sparse pattern for each attention head is determined online with negligible overhead (\textasciitilde\,0.2\%) with our proposed {\bf ARM} (Adaptive Recognition Module) during inference. Our proposed {\bf RainFusion} is a plug-and-play method, that can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art 3D-attention video generation models without additional training or calibration. We evaluate our method on leading open-sourced models including HunyuanVideo, OpenSoraPlan-1.2 and CogVideoX-5B, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that RainFusion achieves over {\bf 2\(\times\)} speedup in attention computation while maintaining video quality, with only a minimal impact on VBench scores (-0.2\%).</p></details> |  |
| **[Frame-Level Captions for Long Video Generation with Complex Multi Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20827v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating long videos that can show complex stories, like movie scenes from scripts, has great promise and offers much more than short clips. However, current methods that use autoregression with diffusion models often struggle because their step-by-step process naturally leads to a serious error accumulation (drift). Also, many existing ways to make long videos focus on single, continuous scenes, making them less useful for stories with many events and changes. This paper introduces a new approach to solve these problems. First, we propose a novel way to annotate datasets at the frame-level, providing detailed text guidance needed for making complex, multi-scene long videos. This detailed guidance works with a Frame-Level Attention Mechanism to make sure text and video match precisely. A key feature is that each part (frame) within these windows can be guided by its own distinct text prompt. Our training uses Diffusion Forcing to provide the model with the ability to handle time flexibly. We tested our approach on difficult VBench 2.0 benchmarks ("Complex Plots" and "Complex Landscapes") based on the WanX2.1-T2V-1.3B model. The results show our method is better at following instructions in complex, changing scenes and creates high-quality long videos. We plan to share our dataset annotation methods and trained models with the research community. Project page: https://zgctroy.github.io/frame-level-captions .</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generalizable Robot Policy with Human Demonstration Video as a Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20795v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent robot learning methods commonly rely on imitation learning from massive robotic dataset collected with teleoperation. When facing a new task, such methods generally require collecting a set of new teleoperation data and finetuning the policy. Furthermore, the teleoperation data collection pipeline is also tedious and expensive. Instead, human is able to efficiently learn new tasks by just watching others do. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage framework that utilizes human demonstrations to learn a generalizable robot policy. Such policy can directly take human demonstration video as a prompt and perform new tasks without any new teleoperation data and model finetuning at all. In the first stage, we train video generation model that captures a joint representation for both the human and robot demonstration video data using cross-prediction. In the second stage, we fuse the learned representation with a shared action space between human and robot using a novel prototypical contrastive loss. Empirical evaluations on real-world dexterous manipulation tasks show the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photography Perspective Composition: Towards Aesthetic Perspective Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20655v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional photography composition approaches are dominated by 2D cropping-based methods. However, these methods fall short when scenes contain poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that demonstrates the transformation process from suboptimal to optimal perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users to enhance their composition skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Flexible Image Conditioning into Text-to-Video Diffusion Models without Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20629v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-image-to-video (TI2V) generation is a critical problem for controllable video generation using both semantic and visual conditions. Most existing methods typically add visual conditions to text-to-video (T2V) foundation models by finetuning, which is costly in resources and only limited to a few predefined conditioning settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce a unified formulation for TI2V generation with flexible visual conditioning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative training-free approach, dubbed FlexTI2V, that can condition T2V foundation models on an arbitrary amount of images at arbitrary positions. Specifically, we firstly invert the condition images to noisy representation in a latent space. Then, in the denoising process of T2V models, our method uses a novel random patch swapping strategy to incorporate visual features into video representations through local image patches. To balance creativity and fidelity, we use a dynamic control mechanism to adjust the strength of visual conditioning to each video frame. Extensive experiments validate that our method surpasses previous training-free image conditioning methods by a notable margin. We also show more insights of our method by detailed ablation study and analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic-I2V: Exploring Image-to-Video Generation Models via Multimodal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19901v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image-to-video (I2V) generation have shown promising performance in conventional scenarios. However, these methods still encounter significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range, controllability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in comparison to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MotionPro: A Precise Motion Controller for Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20287v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animating images with interactive motion control has garnered popularity for image-to-video (I2V) generation. Modern approaches typically rely on large Gaussian kernels to extend motion trajectories as condition without explicitly defining movement region, leading to coarse motion control and failing to disentangle object and camera moving. To alleviate these, we present MotionPro, a precise motion controller that novelly leverages region-wise trajectory and motion mask to regulate fine-grained motion synthesis and identify target motion category (i.e., object or camera moving), respectively. Technically, MotionPro first estimates the flow maps on each training video via a tracking model, and then samples the region-wise trajectories to simulate inference scenario. Instead of extending flow through large Gaussian kernels, our region-wise trajectory approach enables more precise control by directly utilizing trajectories within local regions, thereby effectively characterizing fine-grained movements. A motion mask is simultaneously derived from the predicted flow maps to capture the holistic motion dynamics of the movement regions. To pursue natural motion control, MotionPro further strengthens video denoising by incorporating both region-wise trajectories and motion mask through feature modulation. More remarkably, we meticulously construct a benchmark, i.e., MC-Bench, with 1.1K user-annotated image-trajectory pairs, for the evaluation of both fine-grained and object-level I2V motion control. Extensive experiments conducted on WebVid-10M and MC-Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of MotionPro.

| **[VideoJAM: Joint Appearance-Motion Representations for Enhanced Motion Generation in Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02492v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite tremendous recent progress, generative video models still struggle to capture real-world motion, dynamics, and physics. We show that this limitation arises from the conventional pixel reconstruction objective, which biases models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of motion coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoJAM, a novel framework that instills an effective motion prior to video generators, by encouraging the model to learn a joint appearance-motion representation. VideoJAM is composed of two complementary units. During training, we extend the objective to predict both the generated pixels and their corresponding motion from a single learned representation. During inference, we introduce Inner-Guidance, a mechanism that steers the generation toward coherent motion by leveraging the model's own evolving motion prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. Notably, our framework can be applied to any video model with minimal adaptations, requiring no modifications to the training data or scaling of the model. VideoJAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion coherence, surpassing highly competitive proprietary models while also enhancing the perceived visual quality of the generations. These findings emphasize that appearance and motion can be complementary and, when effectively integrated, enhance both the visual quality and the coherence of video generation.

| **[DriveCamSim: Generalizable Camera Simulation via Explicit Camera Modeling for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19692v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera sensor simulation serves as a critical role for autonomous driving (AD), e.g. evaluating vision-based AD algorithms. While existing approaches have leveraged generative models for controllable image/video generation, they remain constrained to generating multi-view video sequences with fixed camera viewpoints and video frequency, significantly limiting their downstream applications. To address this, we present a generalizable camera simulation framework DriveCamSim, whose core innovation lies in the proposed Explicit Camera Modeling (ECM) mechanism. Instead of implicit interaction through vanilla attention, ECM establishes explicit pixel-wise correspondences across multi-view and multi-frame dimensions, decoupling the model from overfitting to the specific camera configurations (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, number of views) and temporal sampling rates presented in the training data. For controllable generation, we identify the issue of information loss inherent in existing conditional encoding and injection pipelines, proposing an information-preserving control mechanism. This control mechanism not only improves conditional controllability, but also can be extended to be identity-aware to enhance temporal consistency in foreground object rendering. With above designs, our model demonstrates superior performance in both visual quality and controllability, as well as generalization capability across spatial-level (camera parameters variations) and temporal-level (video frame rate variations), enabling flexible user-customizable camera simulation tailored to diverse application scenarios. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/swc-17/DriveCamSim for facilitating future research.</p></details> |  |

To address this critical gap, we introduce TDVE-DB, a large-scale benchmark dataset for text-driven video editing. TDVE-DB consists of 3,857 edited videos generated from 12 diverse models across 8 editing categories, and is annotated with 173,565 human subjective ratings along three crucial dimensions, i.e., edited video quality, editing alignment, and structural consistency. Based on TDVE-DB, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation for the 12 state-of-the-art editing models revealing the strengths and weaknesses of current video techniques, and then benchmark existing VQA methods in the context of text-driven video editing evaluation. Building on these insights, we propose TDVE-Assessor, a novel VQA model specifically designed for text-driven video editing assessment. TDVE-Assessor integrates both spatial and temporal video features into a large language model (LLM) for rich contextual understanding to provide comprehensive quality assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDVE-Assessor substantially outperforms existing VQA models on TDVE-DB across all three evaluation dimensions, setting a new state-of-the-art. Both TDVE-DB and TDVE-Assessor will be released upon the publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 14 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Fast Video Generation with Sliding Tile Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04507v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention power state-of-the-art video generation, but suffer from prohibitive compute cost -- when generating just a 5-second 720P video, attention alone takes 800 out of 945 seconds of total inference time. This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to address this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in pretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D windows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA eliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise sliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel hardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being hardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the first efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving 58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over FlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading video DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s without quality degradation, requiring no training. Enabling finetuning further lowers latency to 268s with only a 0.09% drop on VBench. We make our codebase public at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML 25 |
| **[The Role of Video Generation in Enhancing Data-Limited Action Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19495v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video action understanding tasks in real-world scenarios always suffer data limitations. In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot action recognition.</p></details> | IJCAI2025 |
| **[Force Prompting: Video Generation Models Can Learn and Generalize Physics-based Control Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19386v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation models have sparked interest in world models capable of simulating realistic environments. While navigation has been well-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces remain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces as a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable users to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as poking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric. We demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond realistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion prior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics simulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the difficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in the real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in synthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of physics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can generalize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning from videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few objects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse geometries, settings, and materials. We also try to understand the source of this generalization and perform ablations that reveal two key elements: visual diversity and the use of specific text keywords during training. Our approach is trained on only around 15k training examples for a single day on four A100 GPUs, and outperforms existing methods on force adherence and physics realism, bringing world models closer to real-world physics interactions. We release all datasets, code, weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://force-prompting.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[From Single Images to Motion Policies via Video-Generation Environment Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19306v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robots typically need to construct representations of their surroundings and adapt their motions to the geometry of their environment. Here, we tackle the problem of constructing a policy model for collision-free motion generation, consistent with the environment, from a single input RGB image. Extracting 3D structures from a single image often involves monocular depth estimation. Developments in depth estimation have given rise to large pre-trained models such as DepthAnything. However, using outputs of these models for downstream motion generation is challenging due to frustum-shaped errors that arise. Instead, we propose a framework known as Video-Generation Environment Representation (VGER), which leverages the advances of large-scale video generation models to generate a moving camera video conditioned on the input image. Frames of this video, which form a multiview dataset, are then input into a pre-trained 3D foundation model to produce a dense point cloud. We then introduce a multi-scale noise approach to train an implicit representation of the environment structure and build a motion generation model that complies with the geometry of the representation. We extensively evaluate VGER over a diverse set of indoor and outdoor environments. We demonstrate its ability to produce smooth motions that account for the captured geometry of a scene, all from a single RGB input image.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches either build on methods that employ template-based 3D representations or emerging video generation models but suffer from poor quality or limited consistency and identity preservation when generating individual or multiple digital humans. In this paper, we introduce a new interspatial attention (ISA) mechanism as a scalable building block for modern diffusion transformer (DiT)--based video generation models. ISA is a new type of cross attention that uses relative positional encodings tailored for the generation of human videos. Leveraging a custom-developed video variation autoencoder, we train a latent ISA-based diffusion model on a large corpus of video data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for 4D human video synthesis, demonstrating remarkable motion consistency and identity preservation while providing precise control of the camera and body poses.

Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zero4dvid.github.io/</p></details> |

Despite these advances, diffusion-based video generation remains computationally intensive, especially for high-resolution, long-duration videos. Prior work accelerates its inference by skipping computation, usually at the cost of severe quality degradation. In this paper, we propose SRDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages collaboration between large and small models to reduce inference cost. The large model handles high-noise steps to ensure semantic and motion fidelity (Sketching), while the smaller model refines visual details in low-noise steps (Rendering). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, over 3$\times$ speedup for Wan with nearly no quality loss for VBench, and 2$\times$ speedup for CogVideoX. Our method is introduced as a new direction orthogonal to existing acceleration strategies, offering a practical solution for scalable video generation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

However, evaluating these policies in real-world scenarios remains time-consuming and challenging, particularly as the number of tasks scales and environmental conditions change. In this work, we demonstrate that world models can serve as a scalable, reproducible, and reliable proxy for real-world robot policy evaluation. A key challenge is generating accurate policy videos from world models that faithfully reflect the robot actions. We observe that directly inputting robot actions or using high-dimensional encoding methods often fails to generate action-following videos. To address this, we propose Policy2Vec, a simple yet effective approach to turn a video generation model into a world simulator that follows latent action to generate the robot video. We then introduce WorldEval, an automated pipeline designed to evaluate real-world robot policies entirely online. WorldEval effectively ranks various robot policies and individual checkpoints within a single policy, and functions as a safety detector to prevent dangerous actions by newly developed robot models. Through comprehensive paired evaluations of manipulation policies in real-world environments, we demonstrate a strong correlation between policy performance in WorldEval and real-world scenarios. Furthermore, our method significantly outperforms popular methods such as real-to-sim approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is available at https://worldeval.github.io</p></details> |

Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, potentially limiting their applications. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which improves the image quality by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. SG only relies on the sampling probabilities of its own diffusion model at different noise levels with no need of any guidance-specific training. This makes it flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms. We also introduce a more efficient approximation of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid doubling sampling time. We conduct experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG with only one forward pass. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability of eliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We will release our code along with this paper.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

This makes minute-length video generation extremely expensive, limiting most existing models to generating videos of only 10-20 seconds length. We propose a Linear-complexity text-to-video Generation (LinGen) framework whose cost scales linearly in the number of pixels. For the first time, LinGen enables high-resolution minute-length video generation on a single GPU without compromising quality. It replaces the computationally-dominant and quadratic-complexity block, self-attention, with a linear-complexity block called MATE, which consists of an MA-branch and a TE-branch. The MA-branch targets short-to-long-range correlations, combining a bidirectional Mamba2 block with our token rearrangement method, Rotary Major Scan, and our review tokens developed for long video generation. The TE-branch is a novel TEmporal Swin Attention block that focuses on temporal correlations between adjacent tokens and medium-range tokens. The MATE block addresses the adjacency preservation issue of Mamba and improves the consistency of generated videos significantly. Experimental results show that LinGen outperforms DiT (with a 75.6% win rate) in video quality with up to 15$\times$ (11.5$\times$) FLOPs (latency) reduction. Furthermore, both automatic metrics and human evaluation demonstrate our LinGen-4B yields comparable video quality to state-of-the-art models (with a 50.5%, 52.1%, 49.1% win rate with respect to Gen-3, LumaLabs, and Kling, respectively). This paves the way to hour-length movie generation and real-time interactive video generation.

| **[Sparse VideoGen2: Accelerate Video Generation with Sparse Attention via Semantic-Aware Permutation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18875v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CAT-LVDM, the first corruption-aware training framework for LVDMs that improves robustness through structured, data-aligned noise injection. Our method includes Batch-Centered Noise Injection (BCNI), which perturbs embeddings along intra-batch semantic directions to preserve temporal consistency. BCNI is especially effective on caption-rich datasets like WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD. We also propose Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise (SACN), which injects noise along dominant spectral directions to improve low-frequency smoothness, showing strong results on UCF-101. On average, BCNI reduces FVD by 31.9% across WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD, while SACN yields a 12.3% improvement on UCF-101. Ablation studies confirm the benefit of low-rank, data-aligned noise. Our theoretical analysis further explains how such perturbations tighten entropy, Wasserstein, score-drift, mixing-time, and generalization bounds.

While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) dependence on lengthy, computation-heavy calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) Progressive Bounded Quantization (PBQ) and (2) Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization error reduction, as well as (3) $\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS) for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately 2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on HunyuanVideo while maintaining visual fidelity.

| **[ProphetDWM: A Driving World Model for Rolling Out Future Actions and Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18650v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world driving requires people to observe the current environment, anticipate the future, and make appropriate driving decisions. This requirement is aligned well with the capabilities of world models, which understand the environment and predict the future. However, recent world models in autonomous driving are built explicitly, where they could predict the future by controllable driving video generation. We argue that driving world models should have two additional abilities: action control and action prediction. Following this line, previous methods are limited because they predict the video requires given actions of the same length as the video and ignore the dynamical action laws. To address these issues, we propose ProphetDWM, a novel end-to-end driving world model that jointly predicts future videos and actions. Our world model has an action module to learn latent action from the present to the future period by giving the action sequence and observations. And a diffusion-model-based transition module to learn the state distribution. The model is jointly trained by learning latent actions given finite states and predicting action and video. The joint learning connects the action dynamics and states and enables long-term future prediction. We evaluate our method in video generation and action prediction tasks on the Nuscenes dataset. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best video consistency and best action prediction accuracy, while also enabling high-quality long-term video and action generation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

However, these video-derived cues often suffer from low temporal resolution, motion blur, and unreliable performance under challenging lighting conditions. In contrast, event cameras inherently provide robust and high temporal-resolution motion information, offering resilience to motion blur, low-light environments, and exposure variations. In this paper, we propose EvAnimate, the first method leveraging event streams as robust and precise motion cues for conditional human image animation. Our approach is fully compatible with diffusion-based generative models, enabled by encoding asynchronous event data into a specialized three-channel representation with adaptive slicing rates and densities. High-quality and temporally coherent animations are achieved through a dual-branch architecture explicitly designed to exploit event-driven dynamics, significantly enhancing performance under challenging real-world conditions. Enhanced cross-subject generalization is further achieved using specialized augmentation strategies. To facilitate future research, we establish a new benchmarking, including simulated event data for training and validation, and a real-world event dataset capturing human actions under normal and challenging scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate that EvAnimate achieves high temporal fidelity and robust performance in scenarios where traditional video-derived cues fall short.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reenact Anything: Semantic Video Motion Transfer Using Motion-Textual Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00458v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a tremendous improvement in the quality of video generation and editing approaches. While several techniques focus on editing appearance, few address motion. Current approaches using text, trajectories, or bounding boxes are limited to simple motions, so we specify motions with a single motion reference video instead. We further propose to use a pre-trained image-to-video model rather than a text-to-video model. This approach allows us to preserve the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and helps disentangle appearance from motion. Our method, called motion-textual inversion, leverages our observation that image-to-video models extract appearance mainly from the (latent) image input, while the text/image embedding injected via cross-attention predominantly controls motion. We thus represent motion using text/image embedding tokens. By operating on an inflated motion-text embedding containing multiple text/image embedding tokens per frame, we achieve a high temporal motion granularity. Once optimized on the motion reference video, this embedding can be applied to various target images to generate videos with semantically similar motions. Our approach does not require spatial alignment between the motion reference video and target image, generalizes across various domains, and can be applied to various tasks such as full-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate objects and the camera. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the semantic video motion transfer task, significantly outperforming existing methods in this context.

| **[ScalingNoise: Scaling Inference-Time Search for Generating Infinite Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16400v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (VDMs) facilitate the generation of high-quality videos, with current research predominantly concentrated on scaling efforts during training through improvements in data quality, computational resources, and model complexity. However, inference-time scaling has received less attention, with most approaches restricting models to a single generation attempt. Recent studies have uncovered the existence of "golden noises" that can enhance video quality during generation. Building on this, we find that guiding the scaling inference-time search of VDMs to identify better noise candidates not only evaluates the quality of the frames generated in the current step but also preserves the high-level object features by referencing the anchor frame from previous multi-chunks, thereby delivering long-term value. Our analysis reveals that diffusion models inherently possess flexible adjustments of computation by varying denoising steps, and even a one-step denoising approach, when guided by a reward signal, yields significant long-term benefits. Based on the observation, we proposeScalingNoise, a plug-and-play inference-time search strategy that identifies golden initial noises for the diffusion sampling process to improve global content consistency and visual diversity. Specifically, we perform one-step denoising to convert initial noises into a clip and subsequently evaluate its long-term value, leveraging a reward model anchored by previously generated content. Moreover, to preserve diversity, we sample candidates from a tilted noise distribution that up-weights promising noises. In this way, ScalingNoise significantly reduces noise-induced errors, ensuring more coherent and spatiotemporally consistent video generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed ScalingNoise effectively improves long video generation.</p></details> |  |

While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic dynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a wide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics solver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video generator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated video is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop between the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables intuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of physics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video generators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to interact with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow, liquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input. Code will be made public. Project website: https://kyleleey.github.io/WonderPlay/</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

Identity-Preserving Multi-Person Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18078v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable video generation (CVG) has advanced rapidly, yet current systems falter when more than one actor must move, interact, and exchange positions under noisy control signals. We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce (i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii) HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital production, simulation, and embodied intelligence.

Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code will be released upon acceptance</p></details> |

While existing methods generate safety-critical driving trajectories, simulations, or single-view videos, they fall short of meeting the demands of advanced end-to-end autonomous systems (E2E AD), which require real-world, multi-view video data. To bridge this gap, we introduce SafeMVDrive, the first framework designed to generate high-quality, safety-critical, multi-view driving videos grounded in real-world domains. SafeMVDrive strategically integrates a safety-critical trajectory generator with an advanced multi-view video generator. To tackle the challenges inherent in this integration, we first enhance scene understanding ability of the trajectory generator by incorporating visual context -- which is previously unavailable to such generator -- and leveraging a GRPO-finetuned vision-language model to achieve more realistic and context-aware trajectory generation. Second, recognizing that existing multi-view video generators struggle to render realistic collision events, we introduce a two-stage, controllable trajectory generation mechanism that produces collision-evasion trajectories, ensuring both video quality and safety-critical fidelity. Finally, we employ a diffusion-based multi-view video generator to synthesize high-quality safety-critical driving videos from the generated trajectories. Experiments conducted on an E2E AD planner demonstrate a significant increase in collision rate when tested with our generated data, validating the effectiveness of SafeMVDrive in stress-testing planning modules. Our code, examples, and datasets are publicly available at: https://zhoujiawei3.github.io/SafeMVDrive/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Image and Video Generation via Test-Time Evolutionary Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17618v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the marginal cost of scaling computation (data and parameters) during model pre-training continues to increase substantially, test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising direction for improving generative model performance by allocating additional computation at inference time. While TTS has demonstrated significant success across multiple language tasks, there remains a notable gap in understanding the test-time scaling behaviors of image and video generative models (diffusion-based or flow-based models). Although recent works have initiated exploration into inference-time strategies for vision tasks, these approaches face critical limitations: being constrained to task-specific domains, exhibiting poor scalability, or falling into reward over-optimization that sacrifices sample diversity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Evo}lutionary \textbf{Search} (EvoSearch), a novel, generalist, and efficient TTS method that effectively enhances the scalability of both image and video generation across diffusion and flow models, without requiring additional training or model expansion. EvoSearch reformulates test-time scaling for diffusion and flow models as an evolutionary search problem, leveraging principles from biological evolution to efficiently explore and refine the denoising trajectory. By incorporating carefully designed selection and mutation mechanisms tailored to the stochastic differential equation denoising process, EvoSearch iteratively generates higher-quality offspring while preserving population diversity. Through extensive evaluation across both diffusion and flow architectures for image and video generation tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieves higher diversity, and shows strong generalizability to unseen evaluation metrics.

However, extending these models to generate long, cross-scene videos remains a significant challenge. As the context length grows during autoregressive decoding, computational costs rise sharply, and the model's ability to maintain consistency and adhere to evolving textual prompts deteriorates. We introduce InfLVG, an inference-time framework that enables coherent long video generation without requiring additional long-form video data. InfLVG leverages a learnable context selection policy, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to dynamically identify and retain the most semantically relevant context throughout the generation process. Instead of accumulating the entire generation history, the policy ranks and selects the top-$K$ most contextually relevant tokens, allowing the model to maintain a fixed computational budget while preserving content consistency and prompt alignment. To optimize the policy, we design a hybrid reward function that jointly captures semantic alignment, cross-scene consistency, and artifact reduction. To benchmark performance, we introduce the Cross-scene Video Benchmark (CsVBench) along with an Event Prompt Set (EPS) that simulates complex multi-scene transitions involving shared subjects and varied actions/backgrounds. Experimental results show that InfLVG can extend video length by up to 9$\times$, achieving strong consistency and semantic fidelity across scenes.

Meanwhile, efforts to generate adversarial driving scenarios often operate on abstract trajectory or BEV representations, falling short of delivering realistic sensor data that can truly stress-test autonomous driving (AD) systems. In this work, we introduce Challenger, a framework that produces physically plausible yet photorealistic adversarial driving videos. Generating such videos poses a fundamental challenge: it requires jointly optimizing over the space of traffic interactions and high-fidelity sensor observations. Challenger makes this affordable through two techniques: (1) a physics-aware multi-round trajectory refinement process that narrows down candidate adversarial maneuvers, and (2) a tailored trajectory scoring function that encourages realistic yet adversarial behavior while maintaining compatibility with downstream video synthesis. As tested on the nuScenes dataset, Challenger generates a diverse range of aggressive driving scenarios-including cut-ins, sudden lane changes, tailgating, and blind spot intrusions-and renders them into multiview photorealistic videos. Extensive evaluations show that these scenarios significantly increase the collision rate of state-of-the-art end-to-end AD models (UniAD, VAD, SparseDrive, and DiffusionDrive), and importantly, adversarial behaviors discovered for one model often transfer to others.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pixtella.github.io/Challenger/</p></details> |
| **[Unified World Models: Coupling Video and Action Diffusion for Pretraining on Large Robotic Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02792v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. By controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

However, the interplay between motion, structure, and identity representations in these models remains under-explored. Here, we investigate how self-attention query (Q) features simultaneously govern motion, structure, and identity and examine the challenges arising when these representations interact. Our analysis reveals that Q affects not only layout, but that during denoising Q also has a strong effect on subject identity, making it hard to transfer motion without the side-effect of transferring identity. Understanding this dual role enabled us to control query feature injection (Q injection) and demonstrate two applications: (1) a zero-shot motion transfer method - implemented with VideoCrafter2 and WAN 2.1 - that is 10 times more efficient than existing approaches, and (2) a training-free technique for consistent multi-shot video generation, where characters maintain identity across multiple video shots while Q injection enhances motion fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>(1) P...</summary><p>(1) Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/MotionByQueries/ (2) The methods and results in section 5, "Consistent multi-shot video generation", are based on the arXiv version 1 (v1) of this work.

| **[Training-Free Efficient Video Generation via Dynamic Token Carving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16864v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable generation quality of video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, their practical deployment is severely hindered by extensive computational requirements. This inefficiency stems from two key challenges: the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to token length and the multi-step nature of diffusion models. To address these limitations, we present Jenga, a novel inference pipeline that combines dynamic attention carving with progressive resolution generation. Our approach leverages two key insights: (1) early denoising steps do not require high-resolution latents, and (2) later steps do not require dense attention. Jenga introduces a block-wise attention mechanism that dynamically selects relevant token interactions using 3D space-filling curves, alongside a progressive resolution strategy that gradually increases latent resolution during generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Jenga achieves substantial speedups across multiple state-of-the-art video diffusion models while maintaining comparable generation quality (8.83$\times$ speedup with 0.01\% performance drop on VBench). As a plug-and-play solution, Jenga enables practical, high-quality video generation on modern hardware by reducing inference time from minutes to seconds -- without requiring model retraining.

| **[Action2Dialogue: Generating Character-Centric Narratives from Scene-Level Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16819v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in scene-based video generation have enabled systems to synthesize coherent visual narratives from structured prompts. However, a crucial dimension of storytelling -- character-driven dialogue and speech -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that transforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative dialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character expression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the first defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior. While a story generation model such as Text2Story generates the corresponding visual scene, we focus on generating expressive character utterances from these prompts and the scene image. We apply a pretrained vision-language encoder to extract a high-level semantic feature from the representative frame, capturing salient visual context. This feature is then combined with the structured prompts and used to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural, character-consistent dialogue. To ensure contextual consistency across scenes, we introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank that conditions each dialogue generation on the accumulated dialogue history from prior scenes. This approach enables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals and interactions throughout a story. Finally, we render each utterance as expressive, character-consistent speech, resulting in fully-voiced video narratives. Our framework requires no additional training and demonstrates applicability across a variety of story settings, from fantasy adventures to slice-of-life episodes.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing video generation models, including diffusion-based methods, often prioritize visual realism while neglecting physical plausibility, resulting in implausible object dynamics. Prior approaches for physics-aware dynamic generation typically rely on large-scale annotated datasets or extensive model fine-tuning, which imposes significant computational and data collection burdens and limits scalability across scenarios. To address these challenges, we present MAGIC, a training-free framework for single-image physical property inference and dynamic generation, integrating pretrained image-to-video diffusion models with iterative LLM-based reasoning. Our framework generates motion-rich videos from a static image and closes the visual-to-physical gap through a confidence-driven LLM feedback loop that adaptively steers the diffusion model toward physics-relevant motion. To translate visual dynamics into controllable physical behavior, we further introduce a differentiable MPM simulator operating directly on 3D Gaussians reconstructed from the single image, enabling physically grounded, simulation-ready outputs without any supervision or model tuning. Experiments show that MAGIC outperforms existing physics-aware generative methods in inference accuracy and achieves greater temporal coherence than state-of-the-art video diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a comprehensive system, AniSora, designed for animation video generation, which includes a data processing pipeline, a controllable generation model, and an evaluation benchmark. Supported by the data processing pipeline with over 10M high-quality data, the generation model incorporates a spatiotemporal mask module to facilitate key animation production functions such as image-to-video generation, frame interpolation, and localized image-guided animation.

This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency.

To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world applications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the last frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are highly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional frames that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated when the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model with long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase significantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression step). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with Causal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces unidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional frames can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every subsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it shares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage cost.

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public.

However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability.

Existing detection methods, while effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos, which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos, enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric video forensics.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and video generation models, the capacity of current models to grasp and reproduce cinematographic techniques remains largely uncharted, hindered by the scarcity of expert-annotated data. To bridge this gap, we present CineTechBench, a pioneering benchmark founded on precise, manual annotation by seasoned cinematography experts across key cinematography dimensions. Our benchmark covers seven essential aspects-shot scale, shot angle, composition, camera movement, lighting, color, and focal length-and includes over 600 annotated movie images and 120 movie clips with clear cinematographic techniques. For the understanding task, we design question answer pairs and annotated descriptions to assess MLLMs' ability to interpret and explain cinematographic techniques.

We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 15+ MLLMs and 5+ video generation models.

Recent advancements have introduced various control signals to animate static characters, successfully enhancing control over the generation process. However, these methods often lack flexibility, limiting their applicability and making it challenging for users to synthesize a source character into a desired target scene. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, AnyCharV, that flexibly generates character videos using arbitrary source characters and target scenes, guided by pose information. Our approach involves a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we develop a base model capable of integrating the source character with the target scene using pose guidance. The second stage further bootstraps controllable generation through a self-boosting mechanism, where we use the generated video in the first stage and replace the fine mask with the coarse one, enabling training outcomes with better preservation of character details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, the language sequence is not sufficient to describe spatial-temporal details in the visual world. Alternatively, the video sequence is good at capturing such details. Motivated by this fact, we propose a concise Video-GPT in this paper by treating video as new language for visual world modeling. By analogy to next token prediction in GPT, we introduce a novel next clip diffusion paradigm for pretraining Video-GPT. Different from the previous works, this distinct paradigm allows Video-GPT to tackle both short-term generation and long-term prediction, by autoregressively denoising the noisy clip according to the clean clips in the history. Extensive experiments show our Video-GPT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video prediction, which is the key factor towards world modeling (Physics-IQ Benchmark: Video-GPT 34.97 vs. Kling 23.64 vs. Wan 20.89). Moreover, it can be well adapted on 6 mainstream video tasks in both video generation and understanding, showing its great generalization capacity in downstream.

| **[Programmatic Video Prediction Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14948v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of estimating the world model describing the dynamics of a real world process assumes immense importance for anticipating and preparing for future outcomes. For applications such as video surveillance, robotics applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames. Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose GRAT (\textbf{GR}ouping first, \textbf{AT}tending smartly), a training-free attention acceleration strategy for fast image and video generation without compromising output quality. The key insight is to exploit the inherent sparsity in learned attention maps (which tend to be locally focused) in pretrained Diffusion Transformers and leverage better GPU parallelism. Specifically, GRAT first partitions contiguous tokens into non-overlapping groups, aligning both with GPU execution patterns and the local attention structures learned in pretrained generative Transformers. It then accelerates attention by having all query tokens within the same group share a common set of attendable key and value tokens. These key and value tokens are further restricted to structured regions, such as surrounding blocks or criss-cross regions, significantly reducing computational overhead (e.g., attaining a \textbf{35.8$\times$} speedup over full attention when generating $8192\times 8192$ images) while preserving essential attention patterns and long-range context. We validate GRAT on pretrained Flux and HunyuanVideo for image and video generation, respectively. In both cases, GRAT achieves substantially faster inference without any fine-tuning, while maintaining the performance of full attention. We hope GRAT will inspire future research on accelerating Diffusion Transformers for scalable visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at oliverrensu.github.io/project/GRAT</p></details> |

While current DiT models can produce high-definition, high-frame-rate, and highly diverse videos, there is a lack of fine-grained control over the video content. Controlling the motion of subjects in videos using only prompts is challenging, especially when it comes to describing complex movements. Further, existing methods fail to control the motion in image-to-video generation, as the subject in the reference image often differs from the subject in the reference video in terms of initial position, size, and shape. To address this, we propose the Leveraging Motion Prior (LMP) framework for zero-shot video generation. Our framework harnesses the powerful generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion transformers to enable motion in the generated videos to reference user-provided motion videos in both text-to-video and image-to-video generation. To this end, we first introduce a foreground-background disentangle module to distinguish between moving subjects and backgrounds in the reference video, preventing interference in the target video generation. A reweighted motion transfer module is designed to allow the target video to reference the motion from the reference video. To avoid interference from the subject in the reference video, we propose an appearance separation module to suppress the appearance of the reference subject in the target video. We annotate the DAVIS dataset with detailed prompts for our experiments and design evaluation metrics to validate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in generation quality, prompt-video consistency, and control capability.

| **[MTVCrafter: 4D Motion Tokenization for Open-World Human Image Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10238v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human image animation has gained increasing attention and developed rapidly due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely largely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits generalization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation. To tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video Crafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences (i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT (4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens. Compared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust spatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image and character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we introduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention with 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as 4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D world. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new direction for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our MTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98, surpassing the second-best by 65%. Powered by robust motion tokens, MTVCrafter also generalizes well to diverse open-world characters (single/multiple, full/half-body) across various styles and scenarios.

| **[FinePhys: Fine-grained Human Action Generation by Explicitly Incorporating Physical Laws for Effective Skeletal Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13437v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in video generation, synthesizing physically plausible human actions remains a persistent challenge, particularly in modeling fine-grained semantics and complex temporal dynamics. For instance, generating gymnastics routines such as "switch leap with 0.5 turn" poses substantial difficulties for current methods, often yielding unsatisfactory results. To bridge this gap, we propose FinePhys, a Fine-grained human action generation framework that incorporates Physics to obtain effective skeletal guidance. Specifically, FinePhys first estimates 2D poses in an online manner and then performs 2D-to-3D dimension lifting via in-context learning. To mitigate the instability and limited interpretability of purely data-driven 3D poses, we further introduce a physics-based motion re-estimation module governed by Euler-Lagrange equations, calculating joint accelerations via bidirectional temporal updating. The physically predicted 3D poses are then fused with data-driven ones, offering multi-scale 2D heatmap guidance for the diffusion process. Evaluated on three fine-grained action subsets from FineGym (FX-JUMP, FX-TURN, and FX-SALTO), FinePhys significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Comprehensive qualitative results further demonstrate FinePhys's ability to generate more natural and plausible fine-grained human actions.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Trained to denoise per-chunk noise that increases monotonically over time, MAGI-1 enables causal temporal modeling and naturally supports streaming generation. It achieves strong performance on image-to-video (I2V) tasks conditioned on text instructions, providing high temporal consistency and scalability, which are made possible by several algorithmic innovations and a dedicated infrastructure stack. MAGI-1 facilitates controllable generation via chunk-wise prompting and supports real-time, memory-efficient deployment by maintaining constant peak inference cost, regardless of video length. The largest variant of MAGI-1 comprises 24 billion parameters and supports context lengths of up to 4 million tokens, demonstrating the scalability and robustness of our approach.

Despite the effectiveness of the propagation mechanism, they might encounter blurry and inconsistencies when dealing with inaccurate optical flows or large masks. Recently, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a revolutionary technique for video generation tasks. However, pretrained DiT models for video generation all contain a large amount of parameters, which makes it very time consuming to apply to video inpainting tasks. In this paper, we present DiTPainter, an end-to-end video inpainting model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiTPainter uses an efficient transformer network designed for video inpainting, which is trained from scratch instead of initializing from any large pretrained models. DiTPainter can address videos with arbitrary lengths and can be applied to video decaptioning and video completion tasks with an acceptable time cost. Experiments show that DiTPainter outperforms existing video inpainting algorithms with higher quality and better spatial-temporal consistency.</p></details> |  |

DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success.

Despite its popularity in image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely underexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora, the first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video generation process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance is closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover content, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching mechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each assigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the optimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion of watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet transform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local scanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during watermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues for efficient and robust watermark protection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-Sora achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness, which is largely attributed to our proposals. We will release our code upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[EWMBench: Evaluating Scene, Motion, and Semantic Quality in Embodied World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09694v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in creative AI have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images and videos conditioned on language instructions. Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBench), a dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages a meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field.

However, adapting DiT for pose-guided human image animation faces two core challenges: (a) existing U-Net-based pose control methods may be suboptimal for the DiT backbone; and (b) removing text guidance, as in previous approaches, often leads to semantic loss and model degradation. To address these issues, we propose DynamiCtrl, a novel framework for human animation in video DiT architecture. Specifically, we use a shared VAE encoder for human images and driving poses, unifying them into a common latent space, maintaining pose fidelity, and eliminating the need for an expert pose encoder during video denoising. To integrate pose control into the DiT backbone effectively, we propose a novel Pose-adaptive Layer Norm model. It injects normalized pose features into the denoising process via conditioning on visual tokens, enabling seamless and scalable pose control across DiT blocks. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of text removal, we introduce the "Joint-text" paradigm, which preserves the role of text embeddings to provide global semantic context. Through full-attention blocks, image and pose features are aligned with text features, enhancing semantic consistency, leveraging pretrained knowledge, and enabling multi-level control. Experiments verify the superiority of DynamiCtrl on benchmark and self-collected data (e.g., achieving the best LPIPS of 0.166), demonstrating strong character control and high-quality synthesis.

| **[Progressive Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08151v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current frontier video diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable results at generating high-quality videos. However, they can only generate short video clips, normally around 10 seconds or 240 frames, due to computation limitations during training. Existing methods naively achieve autoregressive long video generation by directly placing the ending of the previous clip at the front of the attention window as conditioning, which leads to abrupt scene changes, unnatural motion, and error accumulation. In this work, we introduce a more natural formulation of autoregressive long video generation by revisiting the noise level assumption in video diffusion models. Our key idea is to 1. assign the frames with per-frame, progressively increasing noise levels rather than a single noise level and 2. denoise and shift the frames in small intervals rather than all at once. This allows for smoother attention correspondence among frames with adjacent noise levels, larger overlaps between the attention windows, and better propagation of information from the earlier to the later frames. Video diffusion models equipped with our progressive noise schedule can autoregressively generate long videos with much improved fidelity compared to the baselines and minimal quality degradation over time. We present the first results on text-conditioned 60-second (1440 frames) long video generation at a quality close to frontier models.

Good instructions help to clarify the task and even anticipate the steps needed to solve it. In this work, we propose a robot learning framework for communicating, planning, and executing a wide range of tasks, dubbed This&That. This&That solves general tasks by leveraging video generative models, which, through training on internet-scale data, contain rich physical and semantic context. In this work, we tackle three fundamental challenges in video-based planning: 1) unambiguous task communication with simple human instructions, 2) controllable video generation that respects user intent, and 3) translating visual plans into robot actions. This&That uses language-gesture conditioning to generate video predictions, as a succinct and unambiguous alternative to existing language-only methods, especially in complex and uncertain environments. These video predictions are then fed into a behavior cloning architecture dubbed Diffusion Video to Action (DiVA), which outperforms prior state-of-the-art behavior cloning and video-based planning methods by substantial margins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Context Autoregressive Video Modeling with Next-Frame Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19325v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context video modeling is essential for enabling generative models to function as world simulators, as they must maintain temporal coherence over extended time spans. However, most existing models are trained on short clips, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies, even with test-time extrapolation. While training directly on long videos is a natural solution, the rapid growth of vision tokens makes it computationally prohibitive. To support exploring efficient long-context video modeling, we first establish a strong autoregressive baseline called Frame AutoRegressive (FAR). FAR models temporal dependencies between continuous frames, converges faster than video diffusion transformers, and outperforms token-level autoregressive models. Based on this baseline, we observe context redundancy in video autoregression. Nearby frames are critical for maintaining temporal consistency, whereas distant frames primarily serve as context memory. To eliminate this redundancy, we propose the long short-term context modeling using asymmetric patchify kernels, which apply large kernels to distant frames to reduce redundant tokens, and standard kernels to local frames to preserve fine-grained detail. This significantly reduces the training cost of long videos. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both short and long video generation, providing an effective baseline for long-context autoregressive video modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://farlongctx.github.io/</p></details> |

However, current AI-generated videos (AIGVs) still exhibit limitations in terms of perceptual quality and text-video alignment. Therefore, a reliable and scalable automatic model for AIGV evaluation is desirable, which heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. To this end, we present AIGVE-60K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for AI-Generated Video Evaluation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks, encompassing 3,050 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions, (ii) the largest human annotations, including 120K mean-opinion scores (MOSs) and 60K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 58,500 videos generated from 30 T2V models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both T2V generation and V2T interpretation capabilities. Based on AIGVE-60K, we propose LOVE, a LMM-based metric for AIGV Evaluation from multiple dimensions including perceptual preference, text-video correspondence, and task-specific accuracy in terms of both instance level and model level. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LOVE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AIGVE-60K dataset, but also generalizes effectively to a wide range of other AIGV evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight the significance of the AIGVE-60K dataset. Database and codes are anonymously available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LOVE.</p></details> |  |
| **[VFRTok: Variable Frame Rates Video Tokenizer with Duration-Proportional Information Assumption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12053v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates, causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to existing tokenizers.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

This paper introduces VidCapBench, a video caption evaluation scheme specifically designed for T2V generation, agnostic to any particular caption format. VidCapBench employs a data annotation pipeline, combining expert model labeling and human refinement, to associate each collected video with key information spanning video aesthetics, content, motion, and physical laws. VidCapBench then partitions these key information attributes into automatically assessable and manually assessable subsets, catering to both the rapid evaluation needs of agile development and the accuracy requirements of thorough validation. By evaluating numerous state-of-the-art captioning models, we demonstrate the superior stability and comprehensiveness of VidCapBench compared to existing video captioning evaluation approaches. Verification with off-the-shelf T2V models reveals a significant positive correlation between scores on VidCapBench and the T2V quality evaluation metrics, indicating that VidCapBench can provide valuable guidance for training T2V models.

Unlike image generation, video generation requires a substantially larger number of tokens to produce coherent temporal frames, resulting in significant overhead during the decoding phase. Our key observations are: (i) MLP modules in the decode phase dominate the inference latency, and (ii) there exists high temporal redundancy in MLP outputs of adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{FastCar} framework to accelerate the decode phase for the AR video generation by exploring the temporal redundancy. The Temporal Attention Score (TAS) is proposed to determine whether to apply the replay strategy (\textit{i.e.}, reusing cached MLP outputs from the previous frame to reduce redundant computations) with detailed theoretical analysis and justification. Also, we develop a hardware accelerator on FPGA with Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) based on TAS to enable better resource utilization and faster inference. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional sparse attention approaches with more than 2.1x decoding speedup and higher energy efficiency on the edge. Furthermore, by combining FastCar and sparse attention, FastCar can boost the performance of sparse attention with alleviated drifting, demonstrating our unique advantages for high-resolution and long-duration video generation.

| **[DraftAttention: Fast Video Diffusion via Low-Resolution Attention Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14708v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformer-based video generation models (DiTs) have recently attracted widespread attention for their excellent generation quality. However, their computational cost remains a major bottleneck-attention alone accounts for over 80% of total latency, and generating just 8 seconds of 720p video takes tens of minutes-posing serious challenges to practical application and scalability. To address this, we propose the DraftAttention, a training-free framework for the acceleration of video diffusion transformers with dynamic sparse attention on GPUs. We apply down-sampling to each feature map across frames in the compressed latent space, enabling a higher-level receptive field over the latent composed of hundreds of thousands of tokens. The low-resolution draft attention map, derived from draft query and key, exposes redundancy both spatially within each feature map and temporally across frames. We reorder the query, key, and value based on the draft attention map to guide the sparse attention computation in full resolution, and subsequently restore their original order after the attention computation. This reordering enables structured sparsity that aligns with hardware-optimized execution. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the low-resolution draft attention closely approximates the full attention, providing reliable guidance for constructing accurate sparse attention. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing sparse attention approaches in video generation quality and achieves up to 1.75x end-to-end speedup on GPUs.

This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors. VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical laws.</p></details> |  |

| **[Ophora: A Large-Scale Data-Driven Text-Guided Ophthalmic Surgical Video Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07449v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding.

Toonify, a StyleGAN-based framework, has become widely used for facial image stylization. To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB. In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we employ an improved StyleGAN to generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which addresses the limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable video, which enables Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video frames, and efficiently generate high-quality animation in the next stage. In Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), we learn a stylized neutral head model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated video. By combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the effectiveness of ToonifyGB on the benchmark dataset using two styles: Arcane and Pixar.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating time-consistent dynamics with discriminator-guided image diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09089v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic temporal dynamics are crucial for many video generation, processing and modelling applications, e.g. in computational fluid dynamics, weather prediction, or long-term climate simulations. Video diffusion models (VDMs) are the current state-of-the-art method for generating highly realistic dynamics. However, training VDMs from scratch can be challenging and requires large computational resources, limiting their wider application. Here, we propose a time-consistency discriminator that enables pretrained image diffusion models to generate realistic spatiotemporal dynamics. The discriminator guides the sampling inference process and does not require extensions or finetuning of the image diffusion model. We compare our approach against a VDM trained from scratch on an idealized turbulence simulation and a real-world global precipitation dataset. Our approach performs equally well in terms of temporal consistency, shows improved uncertainty calibration and lower biases compared to the VDM, and achieves stable centennial-scale climate simulations at daily time steps.</p></details> |  |

This revolutionary force offers the most promising path yet toward solving one of engineering's grandest challenges: achieving reliable, fully autonomous driving, particularly the pursuit of Level 5 autonomy. This survey delivers a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the emerging role of GenAI across the autonomous driving stack. We begin by distilling the principles and trade-offs of modern generative modeling, encompassing VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We then map their frontier applications in image, LiDAR, trajectory, occupancy, video generation as well as LLM-guided reasoning and decision making. We categorize practical applications, such as synthetic data workflows, end-to-end driving strategies, high-fidelity digital twin systems, smart transportation networks, and cross-domain transfer to embodied AI. We identify key obstacles and possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases, evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport integration, and socio-technical influence. By unifying these threads, the survey provides a forward-looking reference for researchers, engineers, and policymakers navigating the convergence of generative AI and advanced autonomous mobility.

However, their real-world performance often falls short of user expectations. One key reason is that these models have not been trained on videos related to some topics users want to create. In this paper, we propose VideoUFO, the first Video dataset specifically curated to align with Users' FOcus in real-world scenarios. Beyond this, our VideoUFO also features: (1) minimal (0.29%) overlap with existing video datasets, and (2) videos searched exclusively via YouTube's official API under the Creative Commons license. These two attributes provide future researchers with greater freedom to broaden their training sources. The VideoUFO comprises over 1.09 million video clips, each paired with both a brief and a detailed caption (description). Specifically, through clustering, we first identify 1,291 user-focused topics from the million-scale real text-to-video prompt dataset, VidProM. Then, we use these topics to retrieve videos from YouTube, split the retrieved videos into clips, and generate both brief and detailed captions for each clip. After verifying the clips with specified topics, we are left with about 1.09 million video clips. Our experiments reveal that (1) current 16 text-to-video models do not achieve consistent performance across all user-focused topics; and (2) a simple model trained on VideoUFO outperforms others on worst-performing topics. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/WenhaoWang/VideoUFO and https://github.com/WangWenhao0716/BenchUFO under the CC BY 4.0 License.</p></details> |  |

Instead, a few relevant individual frames are saved for documentation/reporting purposes and these are the frames on which most current colonoscopy AI models are trained on. While developing new unsupervised domain translation methods for colonoscopy (e.g. to translate between real optical and virtual/CT colonoscopy), it is thus typical to start with approaches that initially work for individual frames without temporal consistency. Once an individual-frame model has been finalized, additional contiguous frames are added with a modified deep learning architecture to train a new model from scratch for temporal consistency. This transition to temporally-consistent deep learning models, however, requires significantly more computational and memory resources for training. In this paper, we present a lightweight solution with a tunable temporal parameter, RT-GAN (Recurrent Temporal GAN), for adding temporal consistency to individual frame-based approaches that reduces training requirements by a factor of 5. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two challenging use cases in colonoscopy: haustral fold segmentation (indicative of missed surface) and realistic colonoscopy simulator video generation. We also release a first-of-its kind temporal dataset for colonoscopy for the above use cases. The datasets, accompanying code, and pretrained models will be made available on our Computational Endoscopy Platform GitHub (https://github.com/nadeemlab/CEP).

To obtain the subgoals, existing methods typically resort to video generation models but suffer from model hallucination and computational cost. We present Vis2Plan, an efficient, explainable and white-box visual planning framework powered by symbolic guidance. From raw, unlabeled play data, Vis2Plan harnesses vision foundation models to automatically extract a compact set of task symbols, which allows building a high-level symbolic transition graph for multi-goal, multi-stage planning. At test time, given a desired task goal, our planner conducts planning at the symbolic level and assembles a sequence of physically consistent intermediate sub-goal images grounded by the underlying symbolic representation. Our Vis2Plan outperforms strong diffusion video generation-based visual planners by delivering 53\% higher aggregate success rate in real robot settings while generating visual plans 35$\times$ faster. The results indicate that Vis2Plan is able to generate physically consistent image goals while offering fully inspectable reasoning steps.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, existing diffusion models predominantly concentrate on modeling static 3D scenes or object-level dynamics, constraining their capacity to provide truly immersive experiences. To address this issue, we propose HoloTime, a framework that integrates video diffusion models to generate panoramic videos from a single prompt or reference image, along with a 360-degree 4D scene reconstruction method that seamlessly transforms the generated panoramic video into 4D assets, enabling a fully immersive 4D experience for users. Specifically, to tame video diffusion models for generating high-fidelity panoramic videos, we introduce the 360World dataset, the first comprehensive collection of panoramic videos suitable for downstream 4D scene reconstruction tasks. With this curated dataset, we propose Panoramic Animator, a two-stage image-to-video diffusion model that can convert panoramic images into high-quality panoramic videos. Following this, we present Panoramic Space-Time Reconstruction, which leverages a space-time depth estimation method to transform the generated panoramic videos into 4D point clouds, enabling the optimization of a holistic 4D Gaussian Splatting representation to reconstruct spatially and temporally consistent 4D scenes. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conducted a comparative analysis with existing approaches, revealing its superiority in both panoramic video generation and 4D scene reconstruction. This demonstrates our method's capability to create more engaging and realistic immersive environments, thereby enhancing user experiences in VR and AR applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Homepage: https://zhouhyocean.github.io/holotime/ Code: https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/HoloTime</p></details> |

However, Multi-Concept Video Customization (MCVC) remains a significant challenge. We identify two key challenges for this task: 1) the identity decoupling issue, where directly adopting existing customization methods inevitably mix identity attributes when handling multiple concepts simultaneously, and 2) the scarcity of high-quality video-entity pairs, which is crucial for training a model that can well represent and decouple various customized concepts in video generation. To address these challenges, we introduce ConceptMaster, a novel framework that effectively addresses the identity decoupling issues while maintaining concept fidelity in video customization. Specifically, we propose to learn decoupled multi-concept embeddings and inject them into diffusion models in a standalone manner, which effectively guarantees the quality of customized videos with multiple identities, even for highly similar visual concepts. To overcome the scarcity of high-quality MCVC data, we establish a data construction pipeline, which enables collection of high-quality multi-concept video-entity data pairs across diverse scenarios. A multi-concept video evaluation set is further devised to comprehensively validate our method from three dimensions, including concept fidelity, identity decoupling ability, and video generation quality, across six different concept composition scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptMaster significantly outperforms previous methods for video customization tasks, showing great potential to generate personalized and semantically accurate content for video diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yuzhou914.github.io/ConceptMaster/.

Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion, HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReel-I2V), and five reward models (image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis.

However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$ throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shielded Diffusion: Generating Novel and Diverse Images using Sparse Repellency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06025v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of text-to-image diffusion models raises concerns over reliability, drawing scrutiny under the lens of various metrics like calibration, fairness, or compute efficiency. We focus in this work on two issues that arise when deploying these models: a lack of diversity when prompting images, and a tendency to recreate images from the training set. To solve both problems, we propose a method that coaxes the sampled trajectories of pretrained diffusion models to land on images that fall outside of a reference set. We achieve this by adding repellency terms to the diffusion SDE throughout the generation trajectory, which are triggered whenever the path is expected to land too closely to an image in the shielded reference set. Our method is sparse in the sense that these repellency terms are zero and inactive most of the time, and even more so towards the end of the generation trajectory. Our method, named SPELL for sparse repellency, can be used either with a static reference set that contains protected images, or dynamically, by updating the set at each timestep with the expected images concurrently generated within a batch, and with the images of previously generated batches. We show that adding SPELL to popular diffusion models improves their diversity while impacting their FID only marginally, and performs comparatively better than other recent training-free diversity methods. We also demonstrate how SPELL can ensure a shielded generation away from a very large set of protected images by considering all 1.2M images from ImageNet as the protected set.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

The main difficulty comes from the presence of unstable and chaotic motions, which make long-term prediction impossible. In this paper, we show that the full three-body problem exhibits a strong form of instability known as Arnold diffusion. We consider the planar full three-body problem, formulated as a perturbation of both the Kepler problem and the planar circular restricted three-body problem. We show that the system exhibits Arnold diffusion, in the sense that there is a transfer of energy -- of an amount independent of the perturbation parameter -- between the Kepler problem and the restricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on the topological method of correctly aligned windows, which is implemented into a computer assisted proof. We demonstrate that the approach can be applied to physically relevant masses of the bodies, choosing a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system as an example. In this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation parameter and for the diffusion time.</p></details> | 41 pages, 7 figures |

It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.</p></details> |  |

Reward-based fine-tuning using models trained on human feedback improves alignment but often harms diversity, producing less varied outputs. In this work, we address this trade-off with two contributions. First, we introduce \textit{combined generation}, a novel sampling strategy that applies a reward-tuned diffusion model only in the later stages of the generation process, while preserving the base model for earlier steps. This approach mitigates early-stage overfitting and helps retain global structure and diversity. Second, we propose \textit{ImageReFL}, a fine-tuning method that improves image diversity with minimal loss in quality by training on real images and incorporating multiple regularizers, including diffusion and ReFL losses. Our approach outperforms conventional reward tuning methods on standard quality and diversity metrics. A user study further confirms that our method better balances human preference alignment and visual diversity.

However, real-world applications often require the generative process to adhere to certain constraints but without task-specific fine-tuning. To this end, we propose a training-free method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution at the test time. Our approach leverages twisted SMC with an approximate locally optimal proposal, obtained via a first-order Taylor expansion of the reward function. To address the challenge of ill-defined gradients in discrete spaces, we incorporate a Gumbel-Softmax relaxation, enabling efficient gradient-based approximation within the discrete generative framework. Empirical results on both synthetic datasets and image modelling validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Beam Diffusion Models for Decoding Image Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20429v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from text prompts, they struggle with visual consistency in image sequences. Existing methods generate each image independently, leading to disjointed narratives - a challenge further exacerbated in non-linear storytelling, where scenes must connect beyond adjacent frames. We introduce a novel beam search strategy for latent space exploration, enabling conditional generation of full image sequences with beam search decoding. Unlike prior approaches that use fixed latent priors, our method dynamically searches for an optimal sequence of latent representations, ensuring coherent visual transitions. As the latent denoising space is explored, the beam search graph is pruned with a cross-attention mechanism that efficiently scores search paths, prioritizing alignment with both textual prompts and visual context. Human and automatic evaluations confirm that BeamDiffusion outperforms other baseline methods, producing full sequences with superior coherence, visual continuity, and textual alignment.</p></details> |  |

Unlike deterministic phantoms, which rely on predefined anatomical and metabolic templates, our method employs a two-stage generative process. An initial score-based diffusion model synthesizes low-resolution PET/CT volumes from demographic variables alone, providing global anatomical structures and approximate metabolic activity. This is followed by a super-resolution residual diffusion model that refines spatial resolution. Our framework was trained on 18-F FDG PET/CT scans from the AutoPET dataset and evaluated using organ-wise volume and standardized uptake value (SUV) distributions, comparing synthetic and real data between demographic subgroups. The organ-wise comparison demonstrated strong concordance between synthetic and real images. In particular, most deviations in metabolic uptake values remained within 3-5% of the ground truth in subgroup analysis. These findings highlight the potential of cascaded 3D diffusion models to generate anatomically and metabolically accurate PET/CT images, offering a robust alternative to traditional phantoms and enabling scalable, population-informed synthetic imaging for clinical and research applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI2025 Submitted version</p></details> |
| **[Outsourced diffusion sampling: Efficient posterior inference in latent spaces of generative models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06999v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Any well-behaved generative model over a variable $\mathbf{x}$ can be expressed as a deterministic transformation of an exogenous ('outsourced') Gaussian noise variable $\mathbf{z}$: $\mathbf{x}=f_\theta(\mathbf{z})$. In such a model (\eg, a VAE, GAN, or continuous-time flow-based model), sampling of the target variable $\mathbf{x} \sim p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ is straightforward, but sampling from a posterior distribution of the form $p(\mathbf{x}\mid\mathbf{y}) \propto p_\theta(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where $r$ is a constraint function depending on an auxiliary variable $\mathbf{y}$, is generally intractable. We propose to amortize the cost of sampling from such posterior distributions with diffusion models that sample a distribution in the noise space ($\mathbf{z}$). These diffusion samplers are trained by reinforcement learning algorithms to enforce that the transformed samples $f_\theta(\mathbf{z})$ are distributed according to the posterior in the data space ($\mathbf{x}$). For many models and constraints, the posterior in noise space is smoother than in data space, making it more suitable for amortized inference. Our method enables conditional sampling under unconditional GAN, (H)VAE, and flow-based priors, comparing favorably with other inference methods. We demonstrate the proposed outsourced diffusion sampling in several experiments with large pretrained prior models: conditional image generation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and protein structure generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025; code: https://github.com/HyperPotatoNeo/Outsourced_Diffusion_Sampling</p></details> |

However, existing image generation methods still significantly suffer from the dilemma of image reasoning, especially in logic-centered image generation tasks. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in LLMs, we propose SRRL, a self-reflective RL algorithm for diffusion models to achieve reasoning generation of logical images by performing reflection and iteration across generation trajectories. The intermediate samples in the denoising process carry noise, making accurate reward evaluation difficult. To address this challenge, SRRL treats the entire denoising trajectory as a CoT step with multi-round reflective denoising process and introduces condition guided forward process, which allows for reflective iteration between CoT steps. Through SRRL-based iterative diffusion training, we introduce image reasoning through CoT into generation tasks adhering to physical laws and unconventional physical phenomena for the first time. Notably, experimental results of case study exhibit that the superior performance of our SRRL algorithm even compared with GPT-4o.

| **[Physics-Informed Distillation of Diffusion Models for PDE-Constrained Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22391v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling physical systems in a generative manner offers several advantages, including the ability to handle partial observations, generate diverse solutions, and address both forward and inverse problems. Recently, diffusion models have gained increasing attention in the modeling of physical systems, particularly those governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, diffusion models only access noisy data $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ at intermediate steps, making it infeasible to directly enforce constraints on the clean sample $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ at each noisy level. As a workaround, constraints are typically applied to the expectation of clean samples $\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{x}_0|\boldsymbol{x}_t]$, which is estimated using the learned score network. However, imposing PDE constraints on the expectation does not strictly represent the one on the true clean data, known as Jensen's Gap. This gap creates a trade-off: enforcing PDE constraints may come at the cost of reduced accuracy in generative modeling. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc distillation approach, where PDE constraints are not injected directly into the diffusion process, but instead enforced during a post-hoc distillation stage. We term our method as Physics-Informed Distillation of Diffusion Models (PIDDM). This distillation not only facilitates single-step generation with improved PDE satisfaction, but also support both forward and inverse problem solving and reconstruction from randomly partial observation. Extensive experiments across various PDE benchmarks demonstrate that PIDDM significantly improves PDE satisfaction over several recent and competitive baselines, such as PIDM, DiffusionPDE, and ECI-sampling, with less computation overhead. Our approach can shed light on more efficient and effective strategies for incorporating physical constraints into diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Overcoming Dimensional Factorization Limits in Discrete Diffusion Models through Quantum Joint Distribution Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05151v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores quantum-enhanced discrete diffusion models to overcome classical limitations in learning high-dimensional distributions. We rigorously prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise, eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage in joint distribution learning.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |
| **[A Closer Look on Memorization in Tabular Diffusion Model: A Data-Centric Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22322v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating high-quality tabular data, but they carry privacy risks by reproducing exact training samples. While prior work focuses on dataset-level augmentation to reduce memorization, little is known about which individual samples contribute most. We present the first data-centric study of memorization dynamics in tabular diffusion models. We quantify memorization for each real sample based on how many generated samples are flagged as replicas, using a relative distance ratio. Our empirical analysis reveals a heavy-tailed distribution of memorization counts: a small subset of samples contributes disproportionately to leakage, confirmed via sample-removal experiments. To understand this, we divide real samples into top- and non-top-memorized groups and analyze their training-time behaviors. We track when each sample is first memorized and monitor per-epoch memorization intensity (AUC). Memorized samples are memorized slightly earlier and show stronger signals in early training. Based on these insights, we propose DynamicCut, a two-stage, model-agnostic mitigation method: (a) rank samples by epoch-wise intensity, (b) prune a tunable top fraction, and (c) retrain on the filtered dataset. Across multiple tabular datasets and models, DynamicCut reduces memorization with minimal impact on data diversity and downstream performance. It also complements augmentation-based defenses. Furthermore, DynamicCut enables cross-model transferability: high-ranked samples identified from one model (e.g., a diffusion model) are also effective for reducing memorization when removed from others, such as GANs and VAEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Versatile Cardiovascular Signal Generation with a Unified Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22306v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG), electrocardiography (ECG), and blood pressure (BP) are inherently correlated and complementary, together reflecting the health of cardiovascular system. However, their joint utilization in real-time monitoring is severely limited by diverse acquisition challenges from noisy wearable recordings to burdened invasive procedures. Here we propose UniCardio, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that reconstructs low-quality signals and synthesizes unrecorded signals in a unified generative framework. Its key innovations include a specialized model architecture to manage the signal modalities involved in generation tasks and a continual learning paradigm to incorporate varying modality combinations. By exploiting the complementary nature of cardiovascular signals, UniCardio clearly outperforms recent task-specific baselines in signal denoising, imputation, and translation. The generated signals match the performance of ground-truth signals in detecting abnormal health conditions and estimating vital signs, even in unseen domains, while ensuring interpretability for human experts. These advantages position UniCardio as a promising avenue for advancing AI-assisted healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[MagicTryOn: Harnessing Diffusion Transformer for Garment-Preserving Video Virtual Try-on](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21325v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Virtual Try-On (VVT) aims to simulate the natural appearance of garments across consecutive video frames, capturing their dynamic variations and interactions with human body motion. However, current VVT methods still face challenges in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and garment content preservation. First, they use diffusion models based on the U-Net, which are limited in their expressive capability and struggle to reconstruct complex details. Second, they adopt a separative modeling approach for spatial and temporal attention, which hinders the effective capture of structural relationships and dynamic consistency across frames. Third, their expression of garment details remains insufficient, affecting the realism and stability of the overall synthesized results, especially during human motion. To address the above challenges, we propose MagicTryOn, a video virtual try-on framework built upon the large-scale video diffusion Transformer. We replace the U-Net architecture with a diffusion Transformer and combine full self-attention to jointly model the spatiotemporal consistency of videos. We design a coarse-to-fine garment preservation strategy. The coarse strategy integrates garment tokens during the embedding stage, while the fine strategy incorporates multiple garment-based conditions, such as semantics, textures, and contour lines during the denoising stage. Moreover, we introduce a mask-aware loss to further optimize garment region fidelity. Extensive experiments on both image and video try-on datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SOTA methods in comprehensive evaluations and generalizes to in-the-wild scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[StateSpaceDiffuser: Bringing Long Context to Diffusion World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22246v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have recently become promising tools for predicting realistic visuals based on actions in complex environments. However, their reliance on a short sequence of observations causes them to quickly lose track of context. As a result, visual consistency breaks down after just a few steps, and generated scenes no longer reflect information seen earlier. This limitation of the state-of-the-art diffusion-based world models comes from their lack of a lasting environment state. To address this problem, we introduce StateSpaceDiffuser, where a diffusion model is enabled to perform on long-context tasks by integrating a sequence representation from a state-space model (Mamba), representing the entire interaction history. This design restores long-term memory without sacrificing the high-fidelity synthesis of diffusion models. To rigorously measure temporal consistency, we develop an evaluation protocol that probes a model's ability to reinstantiate seen content in extended rollouts. Comprehensive experiments show that StateSpaceDiffuser significantly outperforms a strong diffusion-only baseline, maintaining a coherent visual context for an order of magnitude more steps. It delivers consistent views in both a 2D maze navigation and a complex 3D environment. These results establish that bringing state-space representations into diffusion models is highly effective in demonstrating both visual details and long-term memory.</p></details> |  |

However, existing algorithms are not easily scalable due to the limitations of near-term quantum devices. Following our previous work on QDMs, here we propose and implement two physics-inspired protocols. In the first, we use the formalism of quantum stochastic walks, showing that a specific interplay of quantum and classical dynamics in the forward process produces statistically more robust models generating sets of MNIST images with lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) than using totally classical dynamics. In the second approach, we realize an algorithm to generate images by exploiting the intrinsic noise of real IBM quantum hardware with only four qubits. Our work could be a starting point to pave the way for new scenarios for large-scale algorithms in quantum Generative AI, where quantum noise is neither mitigated nor corrected, but instead exploited as a useful resource.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Q-VDiT: Towards Accurate Quantization and Distillation of Video-Generation Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22167v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers (DiT) have demonstrated exceptional performance in video generation. However, their large number of parameters and high computational complexity limit their deployment on edge devices. Quantization can reduce storage requirements and accelerate inference by lowering the bit-width of model parameters. Yet, existing quantization methods for image generation models do not generalize well to video generation tasks. We identify two primary challenges: the loss of information during quantization and the misalignment between optimization objectives and the unique requirements of video generation. To address these challenges, we present Q-VDiT, a quantization framework specifically designed for video DiT models. From the quantization perspective, we propose the Token-aware Quantization Estimator (TQE), which compensates for quantization errors in both the token and feature dimensions. From the optimization perspective, we introduce Temporal Maintenance Distillation (TMD), which preserves the spatiotemporal correlations between frames and enables the optimization of each frame with respect to the overall video context. Our W3A6 Q-VDiT achieves a scene consistency of 23.40, setting a new benchmark and outperforming current state-of-the-art quantization methods by 1.9$\times$.

| **[Unifying Continuous and Discrete Text Diffusion with Non-simultaneous Diffusion Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22165v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation, with recent works falling into two main categories: discrete and continuous diffusion models. Discrete diffusion models apply token corruption independently using categorical distributions, allowing for different diffusion progress across tokens but lacking fine-grained control. Continuous diffusion models map tokens to continuous spaces and apply fine-grained noise, but the diffusion progress is uniform across tokens, limiting their ability to capture semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\underline{N}}on-simultan\textbf{\underline{e}}ous C\textbf{\underline{o}}ntinuous \textbf{\underline{Diff}}usion Models (NeoDiff), a novel diffusion model that integrates the strengths of both discrete and continuous approaches. NeoDiff introduces a Poisson diffusion process for the forward process, enabling a flexible and fine-grained noising paradigm, and employs a time predictor for the reverse process to adaptively modulate the denoising progress based on token semantics. Furthermore, NeoDiff utilizes an optimized schedule for inference to ensure more precise noise control and improved performance. Our approach unifies the theories of discrete and continuous diffusion models, offering a more principled and effective framework for text generation. Experimental results on several text generation tasks demonstrate NeoDiff's superior performance compared to baselines of non-autoregressive continuous and discrete diffusion models, iterative-based methods and autoregressive diffusion-based methods. These results highlight NeoDiff's potential as a powerful tool for generating high-quality text and advancing the field of diffusion-based text generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[UniDB: A Unified Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05749v4)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/UniDB-SOC/UniDB/.</p></details> |  |
| **[JEDI: Latent End-to-end Diffusion Mitigates Agent-Human Performance Asymmetry in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19698v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) have achieved super-human level performance on the Atari100k benchmark, driven by reinforcement learning agents trained on powerful diffusion world models. However, we identify that the current aggregates mask a major performance asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in some tasks despite drastically underperforming in others, with the former inflating the aggregate metrics. This is especially pronounced in pixel-based agents trained with diffusion world models. In this work, we address the pronounced asymmetry observed in pixel-based agents as an initial attempt to reverse the worrying upward trend observed in them. We address the problematic aggregates by delineating all tasks as Agent-Optimal or Human-Optimal and advocate for equal importance on metrics from both sets. Next, we hypothesize this pronounced asymmetry is due to the lack of temporally-structured latent space trained with the World Model objective in pixel-based methods. Lastly, to address this issue, we propose Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI), a novel latent diffusion world model trained end-to-end with the self-consistency objective. JEDI outperforms SOTA models in human-optimal tasks while staying competitive across the Atari100k benchmark, and runs 3 times faster with 43% lower memory than the latest pixel-based diffusion baseline. Overall, our work rethinks what it truly means to cross human-level performance in Atari100k.</p></details> | Preprint |

Prior work has demonstrated the feasibility of using conventional low-rank adaptation techniques on pre-trained diffusion models to generate panoramic images. However, the substantial domain gap between perspective and panoramic images raises questions about the underlying mechanisms enabling this empirical success. We hypothesize and examine that the trainable counterparts exhibit distinct behaviors when fine-tuned on panoramic data, and such an adaptation conceals some intrinsic mechanism to leverage the prior knowledge within the pre-trained diffusion models. Our analysis reveals the following: 1) the query and key matrices in the attention modules are responsible for common information that can be shared between the panoramic and perspective domains, thus are less relevant to panorama generation; and 2) the value and output weight matrices specialize in adapting pre-trained knowledge to the panoramic domain, playing a more critical role during fine-tuning for panorama generation. We empirically verify these insights by introducing a simple framework called UniPano, with the objective of establishing an elegant baseline for future research. UniPano not only outperforms existing methods but also significantly reduces memory usage and training time compared to prior dual-branch approaches, making it scalable for end-to-end panorama generation with higher resolution. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach suffers from error propagation, particularly in distant future frames. To address this limitation, this paper proposes the first AutoRegression-Free (ARFree) video prediction framework using diffusion models. Different from an autoregressive video prediction mechanism, ARFree directly predicts any future frame tuples from the context frame tuple. The proposed ARFree consists of two key components: 1) a motion prediction module that predicts a future motion using motion feature extracted from the context frame tuple; 2) a training method that improves motion continuity and contextual consistency between adjacent future frame tuples. Our experiments with two benchmark datasets show that the proposed ARFree video prediction framework outperforms several state-of-the-art video prediction methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Rectified flow enhances inference speed by learning straight-line ordinary differential equation (ODE) paths. However, this approach requires training a flow-matching model from scratch and tends to perform suboptimally, or even poorly, at low step counts. To address the limitations of rectified flow while leveraging the advantages of advanced pre-trained diffusion models, this study integrates pre-trained models with the rectified diffusion method to improve the efficiency of text-to-audio (TTA) generation. Specifically, we propose AudioTurbo, which learns first-order ODE paths from deterministic noise sample pairs generated by a pre-trained TTA model. Experiments on the AudioCaps dataset demonstrate that our model, with only 10 sampling steps, outperforms prior models and reduces inference to 3 steps compared to a flow-matching-based acceleration model.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a theoretical mode-tracking process capable of pinpointing the exact mode of the denoising distribution, and we propose a practical high-density sampler that consistently generates images of higher likelihood than usual samplers. Our empirical findings reveal the existence of significantly higher likelihood samples that typical samplers do not produce, often manifesting as cartoon-like drawings or blurry images depending on the noise level. Curiously, these patterns emerge in datasets devoid of such examples. We also present a novel approach to track sample likelihoods in diffusion SDEs, which remarkably incurs no additional computational cost.

| **[High Volume Rate 3D Ultrasound Reconstruction with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22090v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional ultrasound enables real-time volumetric visualization of anatomical structures. Unlike traditional 2D ultrasound, 3D imaging reduces the reliance on precise probe orientation, potentially making ultrasound more accessible to clinicians with varying levels of experience and improving automated measurements and post-exam analysis. However, achieving both high volume rates and high image quality remains a significant challenge. While 3D diverging waves can provide high volume rates, they suffer from limited tissue harmonic generation and increased multipath effects, which degrade image quality. One compromise is to retain the focusing in elevation while leveraging unfocused diverging waves in the lateral direction to reduce the number of transmissions per elevation plane. Reaching the volume rates achieved by full 3D diverging waves, however, requires dramatically undersampling the number of elevation planes. Subsequently, to render the full volume, simple interpolation techniques are applied. This paper introduces a novel approach to 3D ultrasound reconstruction from a reduced set of elevation planes by employing diffusion models (DMs) to achieve increased spatial and temporal resolution. We compare both traditional and supervised deep learning-based interpolation methods on a 3D cardiac ultrasound dataset. Our results show that DM-based reconstruction consistently outperforms the baselines in image quality and downstream task performance. Additionally, we accelerate inference by leveraging the temporal consistency inherent to ultrasound sequences. Finally, we explore the robustness of the proposed method by exploiting the probabilistic nature of diffusion posterior sampling to quantify reconstruction uncertainty and demonstrate improved recall on out-of-distribution data with synthetic anomalies under strong subsampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, preprint</p></details> |

However, the conventional diffusion training procedure requires samples from target distribution, which is impossible in online RL since we cannot sample from the optimal policy. Backpropagating policy gradient through the diffusion process incurs huge computational costs and instability, thus being expensive and not scalable. To enable efficient training of diffusion policies in online RL, we generalize the conventional denoising score matching by reweighting the loss function. The resulting Reweighted Score Matching (RSM) preserves the optimal solution and low computational cost of denoising score matching, while eliminating the need to sample from the target distribution and allowing learning to optimize value functions. We introduce two tractable reweighted loss functions to solve two commonly used policy optimization problems, policy mirror descent and max-entropy policy, resulting in two practical algorithms named Diffusion Policy Mirror Descent (DPMD) and Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic (SDAC). We conducted comprehensive comparisons on MuJoCo benchmarks. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform recent diffusion-policy online RLs on most tasks, and the DPMD improves more than 120% over soft actor-critic on Humanoid and Ant.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Model Diffusion for Certifiable Few-shot Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06970v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contemporary deep learning, a prevalent and effective workflow for solving low-data problems is adapting powerful pre-trained foundation models (FMs) to new tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, while empirically effective, the resulting solutions lack generalisation guarantees to certify their accuracy - which may be required for ethical or legal reasons prior to deployment in high-importance applications. In this paper we develop a novel transfer learning approach that is designed to facilitate non-vacuous learning theoretic generalisation guarantees for downstream tasks, even in the low-shot regime. Specifically, we first use upstream tasks to train a distribution over PEFT parameters. We then learn the downstream task by a sample-and-evaluate procedure -- sampling plausible PEFTs from the trained diffusion model and selecting the one with the highest likelihood on the downstream data. Crucially, this confines our model hypothesis to a finite set of PEFT samples. In contrast to the typical continuous hypothesis spaces of neural network weights, this facilitates tighter risk certificates. We instantiate our bound and show non-trivial generalization guarantees compared to existing learning approaches which lead to vacuous bounds in the low-shot regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-Fusion: Direct Preference Optimization for Aligning Diffusion Models with Visually Consistent Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22002v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The practical applications of diffusion models have been limited by the misalignment between generated images and corresponding text prompts. Recent studies have introduced direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance the alignment of these models. However, the effectiveness of DPO is constrained by the issue of visual inconsistency, where the significant visual disparity between well-aligned and poorly-aligned images prevents diffusion models from identifying which factors contribute positively to alignment during fine-tuning. To address this issue, this paper introduces D-Fusion, a method to construct DPO-trainable visually consistent samples. On one hand, by performing mask-guided self-attention fusion, the resulting images are not only well-aligned, but also visually consistent with given poorly-aligned images. On the other hand, D-Fusion can retain the denoising trajectories of the resulting images, which are essential for DPO training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of D-Fusion in improving prompt-image alignment when applied to different reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating reactive policies instead of trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) & robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS</p></details> |  |
| **[DvD: Unleashing a Generative Paradigm for Document Dewarping via Coordinates-based Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21975v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document dewarping aims to rectify deformations in photographic document images, thus improving text readability, which has attracted much attention and made great progress, but it is still challenging to preserve document structures. Given recent advances in diffusion models, it is natural for us to consider their potential applicability to document dewarping. However, it is far from straightforward to adopt diffusion models in document dewarping due to their unfaithful control on highly complex document images (e.g., 2000$\times$3000 resolution). In this paper, we propose DvD, the first generative model to tackle document \textbf{D}ewarping \textbf{v}ia a \textbf{D}iffusion framework. To be specific, DvD introduces a coordinate-level denoising instead of typical pixel-level denoising, generating a mapping for deformation rectification. In addition, we further propose a time-variant condition refinement mechanism to enhance the preservation of document structures. In experiments, we find that current document dewarping benchmarks can not evaluate dewarping models comprehensively. To this end, we present AnyPhotoDoc6300, a rigorously designed large-scale document dewarping benchmark comprising 6,300 real image pairs across three distinct domains, enabling fine-grained evaluation of dewarping models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DvD can achieve state-of-the-art performance with acceptable computational efficiency on multiple metrics across various benchmarks including DocUNet, DIR300, and AnyPhotoDoc6300. The new benchmark and code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Way Ticket:Time-Independent Unified Encoder for Distilling Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21960v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable advancements in generative modeling; however, they face a trade-off between inference speed and image quality, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Existing distilled T2I models can generate high-fidelity images with fewer sampling steps, but often struggle with diversity and quality, especially in one-step models. From our analysis, we observe redundant computations in the UNet encoders. Our findings suggest that, for T2I diffusion models, decoders are more adept at capturing richer and more explicit semantic information, while encoders can be effectively shared across decoders from diverse time steps. Based on these observations, we introduce the first Time-independent Unified Encoder TiUE for the student model UNet architecture, which is a loop-free image generation approach for distilling T2I diffusion models. Using a one-pass scheme, TiUE shares encoder features across multiple decoder time steps, enabling parallel sampling and significantly reducing inference time complexity. In addition, we incorporate a KL divergence term to regularize noise prediction, which enhances the perceptual realism and diversity of the generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that TiUE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including LCM, SD-Turbo, and SwiftBrushv2, producing more diverse and realistic results while maintaining the computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR2025, Code: https://github.com/sen-mao/Loopfree</p></details> |
| **[Go With the Flow: Fast Diffusion for Gaussian Mixture Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09059v4)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schrodinger Bridges (SBs) are diffusion processes that steer, in finite time, a given initial distribution to another final one while minimizing a suitable cost functional. Although various methods for computing SBs have recently been proposed in the literature, most of these approaches require computationally expensive training schemes, even for solving low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an analytic parametrization of a set of feasible policies for steering the distribution of a dynamical system from one Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to another. Instead of relying on standard non-convex optimization techniques, the optimal policy within the set can be approximated as the solution of a low-dimensional linear program whose dimension scales linearly with the number of components in each mixture. The proposed method generalizes naturally to more general classes of dynamical systems, such as controllable linear time-varying systems, enabling efficient solutions to multi-marginal momentum SB between GMMs, a challenging distribution interpolation problem. We showcase the potential of this approach in low-to-moderate dimensional problems such as image-to-image translation in the latent space of an autoencoder, learning of cellular dynamics using multi-marginal momentum SB problems, and various other examples. We also test our approach on an Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) benchmark problem and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cases where the boundary distributions are mixture models while requiring virtually no training.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing methods that rely on reconstruction or retrieval techniques or recent approaches that employ multi-stage object-by-object generation, MIDI extends pre-trained image-to-3D object generation models to multi-instance diffusion models, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple 3D instances with accurate spatial relationships and high generalizability. At its core, MIDI incorporates a novel multi-instance attention mechanism, that effectively captures inter-object interactions and spatial coherence directly within the generation process, without the need for complex multi-step processes. The method utilizes partial object images and global scene context as inputs, directly modeling object completion during 3D generation. During training, we effectively supervise the interactions between 3D instances using a limited amount of scene-level data, while incorporating single-object data for regularization, thereby maintaining the pre-trained generalization ability. MIDI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in image-to-scene generation, validated through evaluations on synthetic data, real-world scene data, and stylized scene images generated by text-to-image diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://huanngzh.github.io/MIDI-Page/</p></details> |

Prior work has explored automated graphic design generation using diffusion models, aiming to streamline creative workflows and democratize design capabilities. However, complex graphic design scenarios require accurately adhering to design intent specified by multiple heterogeneous user-provided elements (\eg images, layouts, and texts), which pose multi-condition control challenges for existing methods. Specifically, previous single-condition control models demonstrate effectiveness only within their specialized domains but fail to generalize to other conditions, while existing multi-condition methods often lack fine-grained control over each sub-condition and compromise overall compositional harmony. To address these limitations, we introduce CreatiDesign, a systematic solution for automated graphic design covering both model architecture and dataset construction. First, we design a unified multi-condition driven architecture that enables flexible and precise integration of heterogeneous design elements with minimal architectural modifications to the base diffusion model. Furthermore, to ensure that each condition precisely controls its designated image region and to avoid interference between conditions, we propose a multimodal attention mask mechanism. Additionally, we develop a fully automated pipeline for constructing graphic design datasets, and introduce a new dataset with 400K samples featuring multi-condition annotations, along with a comprehensive benchmark. Experimental results show that CreatiDesign outperforms existing models by a clear margin in faithfully adhering to user intent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Intermediate Layer Optimization and Projected Gradient Descent for Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20789v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems (IPs) involve reconstructing signals from noisy observations. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving IPs, achieving remarkable reconstruction performance. However, existing DM-based methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work DMPlug, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our approaches under appropriate conditions and validate their superiority through extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and nonlinear IPs. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of DMILO and DMILO-PGD in addressing common challenges in DM-based IP solvers.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Recently, it has been extended to diffusion models through methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, existing approaches such as Diffusion-DPO suffer from two key challenges: timestep-dependent instability, caused by a mismatch between the reverse and forward diffusion processes and by high gradient variance in early noisy timesteps, and off-policy bias arising from the mismatch between optimization and data collection policies. We begin by analyzing the reverse diffusion trajectory and observe that instability primarily occurs at early timesteps with low importance weights. To address these issues, we first propose DPO-C\&M, a practical strategy that improves stability by clipping and masking uninformative timesteps while partially mitigating off-policy bias. Building on this, we introduce SDPO (Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization), a principled framework that incorporates importance sampling into the objective to fully correct for off-policy bias and emphasize informative updates during the diffusion process. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B, CogVideoX-5B, and Wan2.1-1.3B demonstrate that both methods outperform standard Diffusion-DPO, with SDPO achieving superior VBench scores, human preference alignment, and training robustness. These results highlight the importance of timestep-aware, distribution-corrected optimization in diffusion-based preference learning.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Quantized Transition Diffusion (QTD), a novel approach that integrates data quantization with discrete diffusion dynamics. Our method first transforms the continuous data distribution $p_*$ into a discrete one $q_*$ via histogram approximation and binary encoding, enabling efficient representation in a structured discrete latent space. We then design a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with Hamming distance-based transitions as the forward process, which inherently supports long-range movements in the original data space. For reverse-time sampling, we introduce a \textit{truncated uniformization} technique to simulate the reverse CTMC, which can provably provide unbiased generation from $q_*$ under minimal score assumptions. Through a novel KL dynamic analysis of the reverse CTMC, we prove that QTD can generate samples with $O(d\ln^2(d/\epsilon))$ score evaluations in expectation to approximate the $d$--dimensional target distribution $p_*$ within an $\epsilon$ error tolerance. Our method not only establishes state-of-the-art inference efficiency but also advances the theoretical foundations of diffusion-based generative modeling by unifying discrete and continuous diffusion paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Firstly, many approaches rely on modeling continuous embeddings, which is suboptimal for inherently discrete data distributions. Secondly, most models optimize variational bounds rather than exact data likelihood, resulting in inaccurate likelihood estimates and degraded sampling quality. While recent diffusion-based models have addressed these issues separately, we tackle them jointly. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), inspired by photon arrival process, which combines exact likelihood estimation with fully discrete-state modeling. Central to our approach is an information-theoretic Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) that has a provable exact relationship with the true data likelihood. ItDPDM achieves improved likelihood and sampling performance over prior discrete and continuous diffusion models on a variety of synthetic discrete datasets. Furthermore, on real-world datasets such as symbolic music and images, ItDPDM attains superior likelihood estimates and competitive generation quality-demonstrating a proof of concept for distribution-robust discrete generative modeling.</p></details> | Pre-print |

However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

However, their tendency to replicate training data raises serious privacy concerns, particularly when the training datasets contain sensitive or private information. Existing mitigation strategies primarily focus on reducing image duplication, modifying the cross-attention mechanism, and altering the denoising backbone architecture of diffusion models. Moreover, recent work has shown that adding a consistent small amount of noise to text embeddings can reduce replication to some degree. In this work, we begin by analyzing the impact of adding varying amounts of noise. Based on our analysis, we propose a fine-grained noise injection technique that probabilistically adds a larger amount of noise to token embeddings. We refer to our method as Fine-grained Probabilistic Addition of Noise (FPAN). Through our extensive experiments, we show that our proposed FPAN can reduce replication by an average of 28.78% compared to the baseline diffusion model without significantly impacting image quality, and outperforms the prior consistent-magnitude-noise-addition approach by 26.51%. Moreover, when combined with other existing mitigation methods, our FPAN approach can further reduce replication by up to 16.82% with similar, if not improved, image quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09790v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models are a class of generative models that construct sequences by progressively denoising samples from a categorical noise distribution. Beyond their rapidly growing ability to generate coherent natural language, these models present a new and important opportunity to enforce sequence-level constraints, a capability that current autoregressive models cannot natively provide. This paper capitalizes on this opportunity by introducing Constrained Discrete Diffusion (CDD), a novel integration of differentiable constraint optimization within the diffusion process to ensure adherence to constraints, logic rules, or safety requirements for generated sequences. Unlike conventional text generators that often rely on post-hoc filtering or model retraining for controllable generation, CDD directly imposes constraints into the discrete diffusion sampling process, resulting in a training-free and effective approach. Experiments in toxicity-controlled text generation, property-constrained molecule design, and instruction-constrained text completion demonstrate that CDD achieves zero constraint violations in a diverse array of tasks while preserving fluency, novelty, and coherence while outperforming autoregressive and existing discrete diffusion approaches.</p></details> |  |

One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional de novo generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on de novo molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size.

However, their iterative denoising process results in significant computational overhead during inference, limiting their practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing acceleration methods often adopt uniform strategies that fail to capture the temporal variations during diffusion generation, while the commonly adopted sequential pruning-then-fine-tuning strategy suffers from sub-optimality due to the misalignment between pruning decisions made on pretrained weights and the model's final parameters. To address these limitations, we introduce ALTER: All-in-One Layer Pruning and Temporal Expert Routing, a unified framework that transforms diffusion models into a mixture of efficient temporal experts. ALTER achieves a single-stage optimization that unifies layer pruning, expert routing, and model fine-tuning by employing a trainable hypernetwork, which dynamically generates layer pruning decisions and manages timestep routing to specialized, pruned expert sub-networks throughout the ongoing fine-tuning of the UNet. This unified co-optimization strategy enables significant efficiency gains while preserving high generative quality. Specifically, ALTER achieves same-level visual fidelity to the original 50-step Stable Diffusion v2.1 model while utilizing only 25.9% of its total MACs with just 20 inference steps and delivering a 3.64x speedup through 35% sparsity.</p></details> |  |

While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Path Planning for Masked Diffusion Model Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03540v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Any order generation of discrete data using masked diffusion models (MDMs) offers a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive models, especially in domains that lack a natural causal ordering of data. However, current popular MDMs depart from their successful continuous diffusion model counterparts with simplified masked inference wherein unmasked tokens cannot be iteratively refined -- even if there is a mistake. In this paper, we extract the full power of MDMs by introducing a novel inference sampling strategy termed Path Planning (P2) that decomposes each generation step into two sub-stages: planning and denoising. Under P2, the planner at every step selects appropriate tokens that are marked to be updated, which can then be sampled using the denoiser. We demonstrate that P2 generalizes all existing sampling strategies for MDMs and critically enhances generative quality through the new capability of refining and updating existing unmasked tokens. We theoretically prove that P2 establishes a (new) expanded evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the log marginal likelihood of data. We instantiate P2 with a family of planners including: 1.) Self-Planning, 2.) BERT-Planning, and 3.) Trained-Planning with a learned planner leading to SOTA generative performance for MDMs on a suite of domains. Specifically, solely using P2 inference, we observe relative improvements of 22% in protein sequence foldability, 8% in RNA sequence pLDDT, 4% in math reasoning, 68% in story generation (ROUGE score), and 33% in code generation for the challenging pass@1 metric.</p></details> |  |
| **[What is Adversarial Training for Diffusion Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21742v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We answer the question in the title, showing that adversarial training (AT) for diffusion models (DMs) fundamentally differs from classifiers: while AT in classifiers enforces output invariance, AT in DMs requires equivariance to keep the diffusion process aligned with the data distribution. AT is a way to enforce smoothness in the diffusion flow, improving robustness to outliers and corrupted data. Unlike prior art, our method makes no assumptions about the noise model and integrates seamlessly into diffusion training by adding random noise, similar to randomized smoothing, or adversarial noise, akin to AT. This enables intrinsic capabilities such as handling noisy data, dealing with extreme variability such as outliers, preventing memorization, and improving robustness. We rigorously evaluate our approach with proof-of-concept datasets with known distributions in low- and high-dimensional space, thereby taking a perfect measure of errors; we further evaluate on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, CelebA and LSUN Bedroom, showing strong performance under severe noise, data corruption, and iterative adversarial attacks.</p></details> | 40 pages |

A key limitation lies in their reliance on the Markovian assumption, which restricts each step to condition only on the current state, leading to potential uncorrectable error accumulation. In this paper, we introduce CaDDi, a discrete diffusion model that conditions on the entire generative trajectory, thereby lifting the Markov constraint and allowing the model to revisit and improve past states. By unifying sequential (causal) and temporal (diffusion) reasoning in a single non-Markovian transformer, CaDDi also treats standard causal language models as a special case and permits the direct reuse of pretrained LLM weights with no architectural changes. Empirically, CaDDi outperforms state-of-the-art discrete diffusion baselines on natural-language benchmarks, substantially narrowing the remaining gap to large autoregressive transformers.</p></details> | Under Review |

Here, we provide a straightforward derivation of classifier-free and classifier-based guidance for discrete diffusion, as well as a new class of diffusion models that leverage uniform noise and that are more guidable because they can continuously edit their outputs. We improve the quality of these models with a novel continuous-time variational lower bound that yields state-of-the-art performance, especially in settings involving guidance or fast generation.

Current approaches predominantly treat CSI compression as a source coding problem, neglecting transmission errors. In finite block length regimes, separate source and channel coding proves suboptimal, with reconstruction performance deteriorating significantly under challenging channel conditions. While existing autoencoder-based compression schemes can be readily extended to support joint source-channel coding, they struggle to capture complex channel distributions and exhibit poor scalability with increasing parameter count. To overcome these inherent limitations of autoencoder-based approaches, we propose Residual-Diffusion Joint Source-Channel Coding (RD-JSCC), a novel framework that integrates a lightweight autoencoder with a residual diffusion module to iteratively refine CSI reconstruction. Our flexible decoding strategy balances computational efficiency and performance by dynamically switching between low-complexity autoencoder decoding and sophisticated diffusion-based refinement based on channel conditions. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that RD-JSCC significantly outperforms existing autoencoder-based approaches in challenging wireless environments. Furthermore, RD-JSCC offers several practical features, including a low-latency 2-step diffusion during inference, support for multiple compression rates with a single model, robustness to fixed-bit quantization, and adaptability to imperfect channel estimation.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

It is desirable for a variety of applications including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/sequence generation. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based fine-tuning of the base model is a popular approach but it can overfit the reward function while requiring significant resources. We frame controllable generation as a problem of finding a distribution that optimizes a KL-regularized objective function. We present SLCD -- Supervised Learning based Controllable Diffusion, which iteratively generates online data and trains a small classifier to guide the generation of the diffusion model. Similar to the standard classifier-guided diffusion, SLCD's key computation primitive is classification and does not involve any complex concepts from RL or control. Via a reduction to no-regret online learning analysis, we show that under KL divergence, the output from SLCD provably converges to the optimal solution of the KL-regularized objective. Further, we empirically demonstrate that SLCD can generate high quality samples with nearly the same inference time as the base model in both image generation with continuous diffusion and biological sequence generation with discrete diffusion.

Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to explicitly reason a comprehensive physical context from the text prompt and use it to guide the generation. To incorporate physical context into the diffusion model, we leverage a Multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a supervisory signal and introduce a set of novel training objectives that jointly enforce physical correctness and semantic consistency with the input text. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning.

Our training algorithm minimizes a novel efficient objective derived via Ito's Lemma, allowing each step to run in $O(1)$ gradient evaluations and nearly-linear-in-$d$ ($O(d^{1.19})$) arithmetic operations, reducing the gap between diffusions on symmetric manifolds and Euclidean space. Manifold symmetries ensure the diffusion satisfies an "average-case" Lipschitz condition, enabling accurate and efficient sample generation.

However, it remains unclear how thoroughly these methods erase the target concept. We begin by proposing two conceptual models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) reducing the likelihood of generating the target concept, and (ii) interfering with the model's internal guidance mechanisms. To thoroughly assess whether a concept has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a suite of independent evaluations. Our evaluation framework includes adversarial attacks, novel probing techniques, and analysis of the model's alternative generations in place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the tension between minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts.

However, state-of-the-art diffusion models (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match the quality of similarly sized Autoregressive (AR) Models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B, Llama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward passes, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for long input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token generation introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling heuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising steps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First, we propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that reuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the computational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a training-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to supervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising iterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on open-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver up to a 34x end-to-end speedup without compromising accuracy. For the first time, diffusion language models achieve a comparable and even faster latency as the widely adopted autoregressive models. Our work successfully paved the way for scaling up the diffusion language model to a broader scope of applications across different domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniSync: Towards Universal Lip Synchronization via Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21448v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lip synchronization is the task of aligning a speaker's lip movements in video with corresponding speech audio, and it is essential for creating realistic, expressive video content. However, existing methods often rely on reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content. In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues, lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniSync significantly outperforms prior methods in both visual quality and lip sync accuracy, achieving superior results in both real-world and AI-generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ziqiaopeng.github.io/OmniSync/</p></details> |
| **[CoDA: Coordinated Diffusion Noise Optimization for Whole-Body Manipulation of Articulated Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21437v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing whole-body manipulation of articulated objects, including body motion, hand motion, and object motion, is a critical yet challenging task with broad applications in virtual humans and robotics. The core challenges are twofold. First, achieving realistic whole-body motion requires tight coordination between the hands and the rest of the body, as their movements are interdependent during manipulation. Second, articulated object manipulation typically involves high degrees of freedom and demands higher precision, often requiring the fingers to be placed at specific regions to actuate movable parts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel coordinated diffusion noise optimization framework. Specifically, we perform noise-space optimization over three specialized diffusion models for the body, left hand, and right hand, each trained on its own motion dataset to improve generalization. Coordination naturally emerges through gradient flow along the human kinematic chain, allowing the global body posture to adapt in response to hand motion objectives with high fidelity. To further enhance precision in hand-object interaction, we adopt a unified representation based on basis point sets (BPS), where end-effector positions are encoded as distances to the same BPS used for object geometry. This unified representation captures fine-grained spatial relationships between the hand and articulated object parts, and the resulting trajectories serve as targets to guide the optimization of diffusion noise, producing highly accurate interaction motion. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches in motion quality and physical plausibility, and enables various capabilities such as object pose control, simultaneous walking and manipulation, and whole-body generation from hand-only data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://phj128.github.io/page/CoDA/index.html</p></details> |
| **[Learning Individual Behavior in Agent-Based Models with Graph Diffusion Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21426v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable, limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches, our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenPO: Generative Diffusion Models Meet On-Policy Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18763v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the powerful exploration capabilities and multimodality of generative diffusion-based policies. While substantial progress has been made in offline RL and off-policy RL settings, integrating diffusion policies into on-policy frameworks like PPO remains underexplored. This gap is particularly significant given the widespread use of large-scale parallel GPU-accelerated simulators, such as IsaacLab, which are optimized for on-policy RL algorithms and enable rapid training of complex robotic tasks. A key challenge lies in computing state-action log-likelihoods under diffusion policies, which is straightforward for Gaussian policies but intractable for flow-based models due to irreversible forward-reverse processes and discretization errors (e.g., Euler-Maruyama approximations). To bridge this gap, we propose GenPO, a generative policy optimization framework that leverages exact diffusion inversion to construct invertible action mappings. GenPO introduces a novel doubled dummy action mechanism that enables invertibility via alternating updates, resolving log-likelihood computation barriers. Furthermore, we also use the action log-likelihood for unbiased entropy and KL divergence estimation, enabling KL-adaptive learning rates and entropy regularization in on-policy updates. Extensive experiments on eight IsaacLab benchmarks, including legged locomotion (Ant, Humanoid, Anymal-D, Unitree H1, Go2), dexterous manipulation (Shadow Hand), aerial control (Quadcopter), and robotic arm tasks (Franka), demonstrate GenPO's superiority over existing RL baselines. Notably, GenPO is the first method to successfully integrate diffusion policies into on-policy RL, unlocking their potential for large-scale parallelized training and real-world robotic deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Convergence Theory for Diffusion Language Models: An Information-Theoretic Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21400v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modern generative modeling, demonstrating strong potential for large language models (LLMs). Unlike conventional autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially, diffusion models enable parallel token sampling, leading to faster generation and eliminating left-to-right generation constraints. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of diffusion model approaches remains underdeveloped. In this work, we develop convergence guarantees for diffusion language models from an information-theoretic perspective. Our analysis demonstrates that the sampling error, measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, decays inversely with the number of iterations $T$ and scales linearly with the mutual information between tokens in the target text sequence. In particular, we establish matching upper and lower bounds, up to some constant factor, to demonstrate the tightness of our convergence analysis. These results offer novel theoretical insights into the practical effectiveness of diffusion language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Predictive Control with Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09342v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become popular for policy learning in robotics due to their ability to capture high-dimensional and multimodal distributions. However, diffusion policies are stochastic and typically trained offline, limiting their ability to handle unseen and dynamic conditions where novel constraints not represented in the training data must be satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose diffusion predictive control with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based control with explicit state and action constraints that can deviate from those in the training data. DPCC incorporates model-based projections into the denoising process of a trained trajectory diffusion model and uses constraint tightening to account for model mismatch. This allows us to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically feasible, and goal-reaching trajectories for predictive control. We show through simulations of a robot manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying novel test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to L4DC 2025.

| **[Regularized Personalization of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models without Distributional Drift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19519v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization using text-to-image diffusion models involves adapting a pretrained model to novel subjects with only a few image examples. This task presents a fundamental challenge, as the model must not only learn the new subject effectively but also preserve its ability to generate diverse and coherent outputs across a wide range of prompts. In other words, successful personalization requires integrating new concepts without forgetting previously learned generative capabilities. Forgetting denotes unintended distributional drift, where the model's output distribution deviates from that of the original pretrained model. In this paper, we provide an analysis of this issue and identify a mismatch between standard training objectives and the goals of personalization. To address this, we propose a new training objective based on a Lipschitz-bounded formulation that explicitly constrains deviation from the pretrained distribution. Our method provides improved control over distributional drift and performs well even in data-scarce scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing personalization methods, achieving higher CLIP-T, CLIP-I, and DINO scores.</p></details> |  |

Despite the development of several methods to accelerate diffusion-based SR models, some (e.g., SinSR) fail to produce realistic perceptual details, while others (e.g., OSEDiff) may hallucinate non-existent structures. To overcome these issues, we present RSD, a new distillation method for ResShift, one of the top diffusion-based SR models. Our method is based on training the student network to produce such images that a new fake ResShift model trained on them will coincide with the teacher model. RSD achieves single-step restoration and outperforms the teacher by a large margin. We show that our distillation method can surpass the other distillation-based method for ResShift - SinSR - making it on par with state-of-the-art diffusion-based SR distillation methods. Compared to SR methods based on pre-trained text-to-image models, RSD produces competitive perceptual quality, provides images with better alignment to degraded input images, and requires fewer parameters and GPU memory. We provide experimental results on various real-world and synthetic datasets, including RealSR, RealSet65, DRealSR, ImageNet, and DIV2K.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models have limitations in dealing with these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for analysis. In recent years, Diffusion models, as a class of emerging generative approaches, have demonstrated promising capabilities in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing tasks. By simulating the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model are capable of modeling high-dimensional spectral structures, generate high-quality samples, and achieve competitive performance in spectral-spatial denoising tasks and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis, and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing, noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new direction for future research.</p></details> |  |

Existing video editing models cannot explicitly control focus planes or adjust bokeh intensity, limiting their applicability for controllable optical effects. Moreover, naively extending image-based bokeh methods to video often results in temporal flickering and unsatisfactory edge blur transitions due to the lack of temporal modeling and generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel one-step video bokeh framework that converts arbitrary input videos into temporally coherent, depth-aware bokeh effects. Our method leverages a multi-plane image (MPI) representation constructed through a progressively widening depth sampling function, providing explicit geometric guidance for depth-dependent blur synthesis. By conditioning a single-step video diffusion model on MPI layers and utilizing the strong 3D priors from pre-trained models such as Stable Video Diffusion, our approach achieves realistic and consistent bokeh effects across diverse scenes. Additionally, we introduce a progressive training strategy to enhance temporal consistency, depth robustness, and detail preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, controllable bokeh effects and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://vivocameraresearch.github.io/any2bokeh/</p></details> |

However, achieving 4-bit quantization remains challenging. Existing methods, primarily based on integer quantization and post-training quantization fine-tuning, struggle with inconsistent performance. Inspired by the success of floating-point (FP) quantization in large language models, we explore low-bit FP quantization for diffusion models and identify key challenges: the failure of signed FP quantization to handle asymmetric activation distributions, the insufficient consideration of temporal complexity in the denoising process during fine-tuning, and the misalignment between fine-tuning loss and quantization error. To address these challenges, we propose the mixup-sign floating-point quantization (MSFP) framework, first introducing unsigned FP quantization in model quantization, along with timestep-aware LoRA (TALoRA) and denoising-factor loss alignment (DFA), which ensure precise and stable fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that we are the first to achieve superior performance in 4-bit FP quantization for diffusion models, outperforming existing PTQ fine-tuning methods in 4-bit INT quantization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Normalized Attention Guidance: Universal Negative Guidance for Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21179v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negative guidance -- explicitly suppressing unwanted attributes -- remains a fundamental challenge in diffusion models, particularly in few-step sampling regimes. While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) works well in standard settings, it fails under aggressive sampling step compression due to divergent predictions between positive and negative branches. We present Normalized Attention Guidance (NAG), an efficient, training-free mechanism that applies extrapolation in attention space with L1-based normalization and refinement. NAG restores effective negative guidance where CFG collapses while maintaining fidelity. Unlike existing approaches, NAG generalizes across architectures (UNet, DiT), sampling regimes (few-step, multi-step), and modalities (image, video), functioning as a \textit{universal} plug-in with minimal computational overhead. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate consistent improvements in text alignment (CLIP Score), fidelity (FID, PFID), and human-perceived quality (ImageReward). Our ablation studies validate each design component, while user studies confirm significant preference for NAG-guided outputs. As a model-agnostic inference-time approach requiring no retraining, NAG provides effortless negative guidance for all modern diffusion frameworks -- pseudocode in the Appendix!</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |

They have also been explored as powerful generative priors for signal recovery, resulting in a substantial improvement in the quality of reconstructed signals. However, existing research on signal recovery with diffusion models either focuses on specific reconstruction problems or is unable to handle nonlinear measurement models with discontinuous or unknown link functions. In this work, we focus on using DMs to achieve accurate recovery from semi-parametric single index models, which encompass a variety of popular nonlinear models that may have {\em discontinuous} and {\em unknown} link functions. We propose an efficient reconstruction method that only requires one round of unconditional sampling and (partial) inversion of DMs. Theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed methods has been established under appropriate conditions. We perform numerical experiments on image datasets for different nonlinear measurement models. We observe that compared to competing methods, our approach can yield more accurate reconstructions while utilizing significantly fewer neural function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

In this work, we address key limitations in state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods for reassembly, namely i) scalability; ii) multimodality; and iii) real-world applicability: beyond square or simple geometric shapes, realistic and complex erosion, or other real-world problems. We propose ReassembleNet, a method that reduces complexity by representing each input piece as a set of contour keypoints and learning to select the most informative ones by Graph Neural Networks pooling inspired techniques. ReassembleNet effectively lowers computational complexity while enabling the integration of features from multiple modalities, including both geometric and texture data. Further enhanced through pretraining on a semi-synthetic dataset. We then apply diffusion-based pose estimation to recover the original structure.

Recently, advanced ODE-based solvers have been developed to mitigate the substantial computational demands of reverse-diffusion solving under limited sampling steps. However, these solvers, heavily inspired by Adams-like multistep methods, rely solely on t-related Lagrange interpolation. We show that t-related Lagrange interpolation is suboptimal for diffusion model and reveal a compact search space comprised of time steps and solver coefficients. Building on our analysis, we propose a novel differentiable solver search algorithm to identify more optimal solver. Equipped with the searched solver, rectified-flow models, e.g., SiT-XL/2 and FlowDCN-XL/2, achieve FID scores of 2.40 and 2.35, respectively, on ImageNet256 with only 10 steps. Meanwhile, DDPM model, DiT-XL/2, reaches a FID score of 2.33 with only 10 steps. Notably, our searched solver outperforms traditional solvers by a significant margin. Moreover, our searched solver demonstrates generality across various model architectures, resolutions, and model sizes.</p></details> | accpeted on ICML25 |
| **[Conditional Diffusion Models with Classifier-Free Gibbs-like Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21101v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving conditional diffusion models by linearly combining the outputs of conditional and unconditional denoisers. While CFG enhances visual quality and improves alignment with prompts, it often reduces sample diversity, leading to a challenging trade-off between quality and diversity. To address this issue, we make two key contributions. First, CFG generally does not correspond to a well-defined denoising diffusion model (DDM). In particular, contrary to common intuition, CFG does not yield samples from the target distribution associated with the limiting CFG score as the noise level approaches zero -- where the data distribution is tilted by a power $w \gt 1$ of the conditional distribution. We identify the missing component: a R\'enyi divergence term that acts as a repulsive force and is required to correct CFG and render it consistent with a proper DDM. Our analysis shows that this correction term vanishes in the low-noise limit. Second, motivated by this insight, we propose a Gibbs-like sampling procedure to draw samples from the desired tilted distribution. This method starts with an initial sample from the conditional diffusion model without CFG and iteratively refines it, preserving diversity while progressively enhancing sample quality. We evaluate our approach on both image and text-to-audio generation tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over CFG across all considered metrics.

At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior -- mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture -- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM.

| **[Exploring Out-of-distribution Detection for Sparse-view Computed Tomography with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06308v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion models as unsupervised solvers for inverse imaging problems. Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) has greatly benefited from these advancements, achieving improved generalization without reliance on measurement parameters. However, this comes at the cost of potential hallucinations, especially when handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To ensure reliability, it is essential to study OOD detection for CT reconstruction across both clinical and industrial applications. This need further extends to enabling the OOD detector to function effectively as an anomaly inspection tool. In this paper, we explore the use of a diffusion model, trained to capture the target distribution for CT reconstruction, as an in-distribution prior. Building on recent research, we employ the model to reconstruct partially diffused input images and assess OOD-ness through multiple reconstruction errors. Adapting this approach for sparse-view CT requires redefining the notions of ``input'' and ``reconstruction error''. Here, we use filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstructions as input and investigate various definitions of reconstruction error. Our proof-of-concept experiments on the MNIST dataset highlight both successes and failures, demonstrating the potential and limitations of integrating such an OOD detector into a CT reconstruction system. Our findings suggest that effective OOD detection can be achieved by comparing measurements with forward-projected reconstructions, provided that reconstructions from noisy FBP inputs are conditioned on the measurements. However, conditioning can sometimes lead the OOD detector to inadvertently reconstruct OOD images well. To counter this, we introduce a weighting approach that improves robustness against highly informative OOD measurements, albeit with a trade-off in performance in certain cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Unbiased Sampling from Boltzmann Distributions via Variance-Tuned Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21005v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) are powerful amortized samplers for Boltzmann distributions; however, imperfect score estimates bias downstream Monte Carlo estimates. Classical importance sampling (IS) can correct this bias, but computing exact likelihoods requires solving the probability-flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE), a procedure that is prohibitively costly and scales poorly with dimensionality. We introduce Variance-Tuned Diffusion Importance Sampling (VT-DIS), a lightweight post-training method that adapts the per-step noise covariance of a pretrained SBDM by minimizing the $\alpha$-divergence ($\alpha=2$) between its forward diffusion and reverse denoising trajectories. VT-DIS assigns a single trajectory-wise importance weight to the joint forward-reverse process, yielding unbiased expectation estimates at test time with negligible overhead compared to standard sampling. On the DW-4, LJ-13, and alanine-dipeptide benchmarks, VT-DIS achieves effective sample sizes of approximately 80 %, 35 %, and 3.5 %, respectively, while using only a fraction of the computational budget required by vanilla diffusion + IS or PF-ODE-based IS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Impact of Frequency Components on Membership Inference Attacks for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20955v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in image generation, but they also raise significant concerns regarding privacy and copyright issues. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are designed to ascertain whether specific data were utilized during a model's training phase. As current MIAs for diffusion models typically exploit the model's image prediction ability, we formalize them into a unified general paradigm which computes the membership score for membership identification. Under this paradigm, we empirically find that existing attacks overlook the inherent deficiency in how diffusion models process high-frequency information. Consequently, this deficiency leads to member data with more high-frequency content being misclassified as hold-out data, and hold-out data with less high-frequency content tend to be misclassified as member data. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that this deficiency reduces the membership advantage of attacks, thereby interfering with the effective discrimination of member data and hold-out data. Based on this insight, we propose a plug-and-play high-frequency filter module to mitigate the adverse effects of the deficiency, which can be seamlessly integrated into any attacks within this general paradigm without additional time costs. Extensive experiments corroborate that this module significantly improves the performance of baseline attacks across different datasets and models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAIL: Self-supervised Albedo Estimation from Real Images with a Latent Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19751v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrinsic image decomposition aims at separating an image into its underlying albedo and shading components, isolating the base color from lighting effects to enable downstream applications such as virtual relighting and scene editing. Despite the rise and success of learning-based approaches, intrinsic image decomposition from real-world images remains a significant challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled ground-truth data. Most existing solutions rely on synthetic data as supervised setups, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world scenes. Self-supervised methods, on the other hand, often produce albedo maps that contain reflections and lack consistency under different lighting conditions. To address this, we propose SAIL, an approach designed to estimate albedo-like representations from single-view real-world images. We repurpose the prior knowledge of a latent diffusion model for unconditioned scene relighting as a surrogate objective for albedo estimation. To extract the albedo, we introduce a novel intrinsic image decomposition fully formulated in the latent space. To guide the training of our latent diffusion model, we introduce regularization terms that constrain both the lighting-dependent and independent components of our latent image decomposition. SAIL predicts stable albedo under varying lighting conditions and generalizes to multiple scenes, using only unlabeled multi-illumination data available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hala-djeghim.github.io/SAIL/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Training One-Step Diffusion Models Without Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08005v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in training one-step diffusion models typically follow a two-stage pipeline: first training a teacher diffusion model and then distilling it into a one-step student model. This process often depends on both the teacher's score function for supervision and its weights for initializing the student model. In this paper, we explore whether one-step diffusion models can be trained directly without this distillation procedure. We introduce a family of new training methods that entirely forgo teacher score supervision, yet outperforms most teacher-guided distillation approaches. This suggests that score supervision is not essential for effective training of one-step diffusion models. However, we find that initializing the student model with the teacher's weights remains critical. Surprisingly, the key advantage of teacher initialization is not due to better latent-to-output mappings, but rather the rich set of feature representations across different noise levels that the teacher diffusion model provides. These insights take us one step closer towards training one-step diffusion models without distillation and provide a better understanding of the roles of teacher supervision and initialization in the distillation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 2 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[NatADiff: Adversarial Boundary Guidance for Natural Adversarial Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20934v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial samples exploit irregularities in the manifold ``learned'' by deep learning models to cause misclassifications. The study of these adversarial samples provides insight into the features a model uses to classify inputs, which can be leveraged to improve robustness against future attacks. However, much of the existing literature focuses on constrained adversarial samples, which do not accurately reflect test-time errors encountered in real-world settings. To address this, we propose `NatADiff', an adversarial sampling scheme that leverages denoising diffusion to generate natural adversarial samples. Our approach is based on the observation that natural adversarial samples frequently contain structural elements from the adversarial class. Deep learning models can exploit these structural elements to shortcut the classification process, rather than learning to genuinely distinguish between classes. To leverage this behavior, we guide the diffusion trajectory towards the intersection of the true and adversarial classes, combining time-travel sampling with augmented classifier guidance to enhance attack transferability while preserving image fidelity. Our method achieves comparable attack success rates to current state-of-the-art techniques, while exhibiting significantly higher transferability across model architectures and better alignment with natural test-time errors as measured by FID. These results demonstrate that NatADiff produces adversarial samples that not only transfer more effectively across models, but more faithfully resemble naturally occurring test-time errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Multi-Agent World Modeling from a Diffusion-Inspired Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20922v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have recently attracted growing interest in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) due to their ability to improve sample efficiency for policy learning. However, accurately modeling environments in MARL is challenging due to the exponentially large joint action space and highly uncertain dynamics inherent in multi-agent systems. To address this, we reduce modeling complexity by shifting from jointly modeling the entire state-action transition dynamics to focusing on the state space alone at each timestep through sequential agent modeling. Specifically, our approach enables the model to progressively resolve uncertainty while capturing the structured dependencies among agents, providing a more accurate representation of how agents influence the state. Interestingly, this sequential revelation of agents' actions in a multi-agent system aligns with the reverse process in diffusion models--a class of powerful generative models known for their expressiveness and training stability compared to autoregressive or latent variable models. Leveraging this insight, we develop a flexible and robust world model for MARL using diffusion models. Our method, Diffusion-Inspired Multi-Agent world model (DIMA), achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple multi-agent control benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior world models in terms of final return and sample efficiency, including MAMuJoCo and Bi-DexHands. DIMA establishes a new paradigm for constructing multi-agent world models, advancing the frontier of MARL research.</p></details> |  |

However, their full potential in solving Continuous Constrained Optimization problems remains largely underexplored. Our work commences by investigating a two-dimensional constrained quadratic optimization problem as an illustrative example to explore the inherent challenges and issues when applying diffusion models to such optimization tasks and providing theoretical analyses for these observations. To address the identified gaps and harness diffusion models for Continuous Constrained Optimization, we build upon this analysis to propose a novel diffusion-based framework for optimization problems called DiOpt. This framework operates in two distinct phases: an initial warm-start phase, implemented via supervised learning, followed by a bootstrapping phase. This dual-phase architecture is designed to iteratively refine solutions, thereby improving the objective function while rigorously satisfying problem constraints. Finally, multiple candidate solutions are sampled, and the optimal one is selected through a screening process. We present extensive experiments detailing the training dynamics of DiOpt, its performance across a diverse set of Continuous Constrained Optimization problems, and an analysis of the impact of DiOpt's various hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods lack precise layout controllability and overlook the potential of dynamic features of reference subjects in improving fidelity. In this work, we propose Layout-Controllable Personalized Diffusion (LCP-Diffusion) model, a novel framework that integrates subject identity preservation with flexible layout guidance in a tuning-free approach. Our model employs a Dynamic-Static Complementary Visual Refining module to comprehensively capture the intricate details of reference subjects, and introduces a Dual Layout Control mechanism to enforce robust spatial control across both training and inference stages. Extensive experiments validate that LCP-Diffusion excels in both identity preservation and layout controllability. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneering work enabling users to "create anything anywhere".</p></details> | ICME 2025 |

In this paper, we introduce a generative approach based on denoising diffusion models (DMs) to synthesize parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Extending the recent diffusion model pipeline of F\"urrutter et al. [1], our model effectively conditions the synthesis process, enabling the simultaneous generation of circuit architectures and their continuous gate parameters. We demonstrate our approach in synthesizing PQCs optimized for generating high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and achieving high accuracy in quantum machine learning (QML) classification tasks. Our results indicate a strong generalization across varying gate sets and scaling qubit counts, highlighting the versatility and computational efficiency of diffusion-based methods. This work illustrates the potential of generative models as a powerful tool for accelerating and optimizing the design of PQCs, supporting the development of more practical and scalable quantum applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[G-DReaM: Graph-conditioned Diffusion Retargeting across Multiple Embodiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20857v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion retargeting for specific robot from existing motion datasets is one critical step in transferring motion patterns from human behaviors to and across various robots. However, inconsistencies in topological structure, geometrical parameters as well as joint correspondence make it difficult to handle diverse embodiments with a unified retargeting architecture. In this work, we propose a novel unified graph-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation framework for retargeting reference motions across diverse embodiments. The intrinsic characteristics of heterogeneous embodiments are represented with graph structure that effectively captures topological and geometrical features of different robots. Such a graph-based encoding further allows for knowledge exploitation at the joint level with a customized attention mechanisms developed in this work. For lacking ground truth motions of the desired embodiment, we utilize an energy-based guidance formulated as retargeting losses to train the diffusion model. As one of the first cross-embodiment motion retargeting methods in robotics, our experiments validate that the proposed model can retarget motions across heterogeneous embodiments in a unified manner. Moreover, it demonstrates a certain degree of generalization to both diverse skeletal structures and similar motion patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do We Need All the Synthetic Data? Towards Targeted Synthetic Image Augmentation via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21574v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetically augmenting training datasets with diffusion models has been an effective strategy for improving generalization of image classifiers. However, existing techniques struggle to ensure the diversity of generation and increase the size of the data by up to 10-30x to improve the in-distribution performance. In this work, we show that synthetically augmenting part of the data that is not learned early in training outperforms augmenting the entire dataset. By analyzing a two-layer CNN, we prove that this strategy improves generalization by promoting homogeneity in feature learning speed without amplifying noise. Our extensive experiments show that by augmenting only 30%-40% of the data, our method boosts the performance by up to 2.8% in a variety of scenarios, including training ResNet, ViT and DenseNet on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, with a range of optimizers including SGD and SAM. Notably, our method applied with SGD outperforms the SOTA optimizer, SAM, on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet. It can also easily stack with existing weak and strong augmentation strategies to further boost the performance.</p></details> |  |
