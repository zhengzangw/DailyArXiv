| **[REGEN: Learning Compact Video Embedding with (Re-)Generative Decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08665v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel perspective on learning video embedders for generative modeling: rather than requiring an exact reproduction of an input video, an effective embedder should focus on synthesizing visually plausible reconstructions. This relaxed criterion enables substantial improvements in compression ratios without compromising the quality of downstream generative models. Specifically, we propose replacing the conventional encoder-decoder video embedder with an encoder-generator framework that employs a diffusion transformer (DiT) to synthesize missing details from a compact latent space. Therein, we develop a dedicated latent conditioning module to condition the DiT decoder on the encoded video latent embedding. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach enables superior encoding-decoding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the compression ratio increases. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we report results from our video embedders achieving a temporal compression ratio of up to 32x (8x higher than leading video embedders) and validate the robustness of this ultra-compact latent space for text-to-video generation, providing a significant efficiency boost in latent diffusion model training and inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning-Free Multi-Event Long Video Generation via Synchronized Coupled Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08605v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in text-to-video diffusion models enable high-quality short video generation from a single prompt, generating real-world long videos in a single pass remains challenging due to limited data and high computational costs. To address this, several works propose tuning-free approaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation, specifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content changes. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions between adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of semantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose Synchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that synchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range consistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two complementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling, which ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence, respectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns denoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended content changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS synchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise, ensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive experiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video generation, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence, outperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page with visuals: https://syncos2025.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Video-to-Audio Generation with Hidden Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07464v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://sites.google.com/view/vta-ldm</p></details> |
| **[$^R$FLAV: Rolling Flow matching for infinite Audio Video generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08307v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint audio-video (AV) generation is still a significant challenge in generative AI, primarily due to three critical requirements: quality of the generated samples, seamless multimodal synchronization and temporal coherence, with audio tracks that match the visual data and vice versa, and limitless video duration. In this paper, we present \arch{}, a novel transformer-based architecture that addresses all the key challenges of AV generation. We explore three distinct cross modality interaction modules, with our lightweight temporal fusion module emerging as the most effective and computationally efficient approach for aligning audio and visual modalities. Our experimental results demonstrate that \arch{} outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in multimodal AV generation tasks.

| **[HunyuanVideo: A Systematic Framework For Large Video Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03603v6)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have significantly impacted daily life for both individuals and industries. However, the leading video generation models remain closed-source, resulting in a notable performance gap between industry capabilities and those available to the public. In this report, we introduce HunyuanVideo, an innovative open-source video foundation model that demonstrates performance in video generation comparable to, or even surpassing, that of leading closed-source models. HunyuanVideo encompasses a comprehensive framework that integrates several key elements, including data curation, advanced architectural design, progressive model scaling and training, and an efficient infrastructure tailored for large-scale model training and inference. As a result, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13 billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. We conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to ensure high visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced filming techniques. According to evaluations by professionals, HunyuanVideo outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6, and three top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code for the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source communities. This initiative will empower individuals within the community to experiment with their ideas, fostering a more dynamic and vibrant video generation ecosystem. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo.</p></details> |  |
| **[WISA: World Simulator Assistant for Physics-Aware Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08153v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent rapid advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation, such as SoRA and Kling, have shown great potential for building world simulators. However, current T2V models struggle to grasp abstract physical principles and generate videos that adhere to physical laws. This challenge arises primarily from a lack of clear guidance on physical information due to a significant gap between abstract physical principles and generation models. To this end, we introduce the World Simulator Assistant (WISA), an effective framework for decomposing and incorporating physical principles into T2V models. Specifically, WISA decomposes physical principles into textual physical descriptions, qualitative physical categories, and quantitative physical properties. To effectively embed these physical attributes into the generation process, WISA incorporates several key designs, including Mixture-of-Physical-Experts Attention (MoPA) and a Physical Classifier, enhancing the model's physics awareness. Furthermore, most existing datasets feature videos where physical phenomena are either weakly represented or entangled with multiple co-occurring processes, limiting their suitability as dedicated resources for learning explicit physical principles. We propose a novel video dataset, WISA-32K, collected based on qualitative physical categories. It consists of 32,000 videos, representing 17 physical laws across three domains of physics: dynamics, thermodynamics, and optics. Experimental results demonstrate that WISA can effectively enhance the compatibility of T2V models with real-world physical laws, achieving a considerable improvement on the VideoPhy benchmark. The visual exhibitions of WISA and WISA-32K are available in the https://360cvgroup.github.io/WISA/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Señorita-2M: A High-Quality Instruction-based Dataset for General Video Editing by Video Specialists](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06734v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have spurred the development of video editing techniques, which can be divided into inversion-based and end-to-end methods. However, current video editing methods still suffer from several challenges. Inversion-based methods, though training-free and flexible, are time-consuming during inference, struggle with fine-grained editing instructions, and produce artifacts and jitter. On the other hand, end-to-end methods, which rely on edited video pairs for training, offer faster inference speeds but often produce poor editing results due to a lack of high-quality training video pairs. In this paper, to close the gap in end-to-end methods, we introduce Se\~norita-2M, a high-quality video editing dataset. Se\~norita-2M consists of approximately 2 millions of video editing pairs. It is built by crafting four high-quality, specialized video editing models, each crafted and trained by our team to achieve state-of-the-art editing results. We also propose a filtering pipeline to eliminate poorly edited video pairs. Furthermore, we explore common video editing architectures to identify the most effective structure based on current pre-trained generative model. Extensive experiments show that our dataset can help to yield remarkably high-quality video editing results. More details are available at https://senorita.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[VACE: All-in-One Video Creation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07598v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer has demonstrated powerful capability and scalability in generating high-quality images and videos. Further pursuing the unification of generation and editing tasks has yielded significant progress in the domain of image content creation. However, due to the intrinsic demands for consistency across both temporal and spatial dynamics, achieving a unified approach for video synthesis remains challenging. We introduce VACE, which enables users to perform Video tasks within an All-in-one framework for Creation and Editing. These tasks include reference-to-video generation, video-to-video editing, and masked video-to-video editing. Specifically, we effectively integrate the requirements of various tasks by organizing video task inputs, such as editing, reference, and masking, into a unified interface referred to as the Video Condition Unit (VCU). Furthermore, by utilizing a Context Adapter structure, we inject different task concepts into the model using formalized representations of temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing it to handle arbitrary video synthesis tasks flexibly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the unified model of VACE achieves performance on par with task-specific models across various subtasks. Simultaneously, it enables diverse applications through versatile task combinations.

| **[MotionAura: Generating High-Quality and Motion Consistent Videos using Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07659v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatio-temporal complexity of video data presents significant challenges in tasks such as compression, generation, and inpainting. We present four key contributions to address the challenges of spatiotemporal video processing. First, we introduce the 3D Mobile Inverted Vector-Quantization Variational Autoencoder (3D-MBQ-VAE), which combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with masked token modeling to enhance spatiotemporal video compression. The model achieves superior temporal consistency and state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality by employing a novel training strategy with full frame masking. Second, we present MotionAura, a text-to-video generation framework that utilizes vector-quantized diffusion models to discretize the latent space and capture complex motion dynamics, producing temporally coherent videos aligned with text prompts. Third, we propose a spectral transformer-based denoising network that processes video data in the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform. This method effectively captures global context and long-range dependencies for high-quality video generation and denoising. Lastly, we introduce a downstream task of Sketch Guided Video Inpainting. This task leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our models achieve SOTA performance on a range of benchmarks. Our work offers robust frameworks for spatiotemporal modeling and user-driven video content manipulation. We will release the code, datasets, and models in open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025 (spotlight paper)</p></details> |
| **[T2VEval: Benchmark Dataset and Objective Evaluation Method for T2V-generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08545v5)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) technology, as demonstrated by models such as Runway Gen-3, Pika, Sora, and Kling, have significantly broadened the applicability and popularity of the technology. This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of T2V-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-to-video outputs remain challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed T2VEval-Bench, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset for text-to-video quality evaluation, which contains 148 textual prompts and 1,783 videos generated by 13 T2V models. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we scored each video on four dimensions in the subjective experiment, which are overall impression, text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Based on T2VEval-Bench, we developed T2VEval, a multi-branch fusion scheme for T2V quality evaluation. T2VEval assesses videos across three branches: text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large language model. Additionally, we implemented a divide-and-conquer training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Physics Simulation for 3D Scenes via MLLM-Guided Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12789v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in 3D generation models have opened new possibilities for simulating dynamic 3D object movements and customizing behaviors, yet creating this content remains challenging. Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[ObjectMover: Generative Object Movement with Video Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08037v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simple as it seems, moving an object to another location within an image is, in fact, a challenging image-editing task that requires re-harmonizing the lighting, adjusting the pose based on perspective, accurately filling occluded regions, and ensuring coherent synchronization of shadows and reflections while maintaining the object identity. In this paper, we present ObjectMover, a generative model that can perform object movement in highly challenging scenes. Our key insight is that we model this task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and fine-tune a video generation model to leverage its knowledge of consistent object generation across video frames. We show that with this approach, our model is able to adjust to complex real-world scenarios, handling extreme lighting harmonization and object effect movement. As large-scale data for object movement are unavailable, we construct a data generation pipeline using a modern game engine to synthesize high-quality data pairs. We further propose a multi-task learning strategy that enables training on real-world video data to improve the model generalization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ObjectMover achieves outstanding results and adapts well to real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://xinyu-andy.github.io/ObjMover</p></details> |
| **[SweetTok: Semantic-Aware Spatial-Temporal Tokenizer for Compact Video Discretization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10443v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the \textbf{S}emantic-a\textbf{W}ar\textbf{E} spatial-t\textbf{E}mporal \textbf{T}okenizer (SweetTok), a novel video tokenizer to overcome the limitations in current video tokenization methods for compacted yet effective discretization. Unlike previous approaches that process flattened local visual patches via direct discretization or adaptive query tokenization, SweetTok proposes a decoupling framework, compressing visual inputs through distinct spatial and temporal queries via \textbf{D}ecoupled \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (DQAE). This design allows SweetTok to efficiently compress video token count while achieving superior fidelity by capturing essential information across spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, we design a \textbf{M}otion-enhanced \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{C}odebook (MLC) tailored for spatial and temporal compression to address the differences in semantic representation between appearance and motion information. SweetTok significantly improves video reconstruction results by \textbf{42.8\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 dataset. With a better token compression strategy, it also boosts downstream video generation results by \textbf{15.1\%} w.r.t gFVD. Additionally, the compressed decoupled tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

Examining Teachers' Perspectives through TPACK and TAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08003v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of generative AI technology, particularly video generative AI (Video GenAI), has opened new possibilities for K-12 education by enabling the creation of dynamic, customized, and high-quality visual content. Despite its potential, there is limited research on how this emerging technology can be effectively integrated into educational practices. This study explores the perspectives of leading K-12 teachers on the educational applications of Video GenAI, using the TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) and TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) frameworks as analytical lenses. Through interviews and hands-on experimentation with video generation tools, the research identifies opportunities for enhancing teaching strategies, fostering student engagement, and supporting authentic task design. It also highlights challenges such as technical limitations, ethical considerations, and the need for institutional support. The findings provide actionable insights into how Video GenAI can transform teaching and learning, offering practical implications for policy, teacher training, and the future development of educational technology.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightMotion: A Light and Tuning-free Method for Simulating Camera Motion in Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06508v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing camera motion-controlled video generation methods face computational bottlenecks in fine-tuning and inference. This paper proposes LightMotion, a light and tuning-free method for simulating camera motion in video generation. Operating in the latent space, it eliminates additional fine-tuning, inpainting, and depth estimation, making it more streamlined than existing methods. The endeavors of this paper comprise: (i) The latent space permutation operation effectively simulates various camera motions like panning, zooming, and rotation. (ii) The latent space resampling strategy combines background-aware sampling and cross-frame alignment to accurately fill new perspectives while maintaining coherence across frames. (iii) Our in-depth analysis shows that the permutation and resampling cause an SNR shift in latent space, leading to poor-quality generation. To address this, we propose latent space correction, which reintroduces noise during denoising to mitigate SNR shift and enhance video generation quality. Exhaustive experiments show that our LightMotion outperforms existing methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | 18 pages in total |

The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that facilitates bidirectional information exchange between video and audio diffusion models through temporally-aligned self attention operations. Unlike prior work that uses dedicated models for A2V and V2A tasks and relies on pretrained feature extractors, AV-Link achieves both tasks in a single self-contained framework, directly leveraging features obtained by the complementary modality (i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video). Extensive automatic and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial improvement in audio-video synchronization, outperforming more expensive baselines such as the MovieGen video-to-audio model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: snap-research.github.io/AVLink/</p></details> |
| **[DreamRelation: Relation-Centric Video Customization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07602v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational video customization refers to the creation of personalized videos that depict user-specified relations between two subjects, a crucial task for comprehending real-world visual content. While existing methods can personalize subject appearances and motions, they still struggle with complex relational video customization, where precise relational modeling and high generalization across subject categories are essential. The primary challenge arises from the intricate spatial arrangements, layout variations, and nuanced temporal dynamics inherent in relations; consequently, current models tend to overemphasize irrelevant visual details rather than capturing meaningful interactions. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRelation, a novel approach that personalizes relations through a small set of exemplar videos, leveraging two key components: Relational Decoupling Learning and Relational Dynamics Enhancement. First, in Relational Decoupling Learning, we disentangle relations from subject appearances using relation LoRA triplet and hybrid mask training strategy, ensuring better generalization across diverse relationships. Furthermore, we determine the optimal design of relation LoRA triplet by analyzing the distinct roles of the query, key, and value features within MM-DiT's attention mechanism, making DreamRelation the first relational video generation framework with explainable components. Second, in Relational Dynamics Enhancement, we introduce space-time relational contrastive loss, which prioritizes relational dynamics while minimizing the reliance on detailed subject appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamRelation outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relational video customization. Code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dreamrelation.github.io</p></details> |
| **[VidStyleODE: Disentangled Video Editing via StyleGAN and NeuralODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06020v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose $\textbf{VidStyleODE}$, a spatiotemporally continuous disentangled $\textbf{Vid}$eo representation based upon $\textbf{Style}$GAN and Neural-$\textbf{ODE}$s. Effective traversal of the latent space learned by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has been the basis for recent breakthroughs in image editing. However, the applicability of such advancements to the video domain has been hindered by the difficulty of representing and controlling videos in the latent space of GANs. In particular, videos are composed of content (i.e., appearance) and complex motion components that require a special mechanism to disentangle and control. To achieve this, VidStyleODE encodes the video content in a pre-trained StyleGAN $\mathcal{W}_+$ space and benefits from a latent ODE component to summarize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the input video. Our novel continuous video generation process then combines the two to generate high-quality and temporally consistent videos with varying frame rates. We show that our proposed method enables a variety of applications on real videos: text-guided appearance manipulation, motion manipulation, image animation, and video interpolation and extrapolation.

| **[AR-Diffusion: Asynchronous Video Generation with Auto-Regressive Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07418v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of video generation requires synthesizing visually realistic and temporally coherent video frames. Existing methods primarily use asynchronous auto-regressive models or synchronous diffusion models to address this challenge. However, asynchronous auto-regressive models often suffer from inconsistencies between training and inference, leading to issues such as error accumulation, while synchronous diffusion models are limited by their reliance on rigid sequence length. To address these issues, we introduce Auto-Regressive Diffusion (AR-Diffusion), a novel model that combines the strengths of auto-regressive and diffusion models for flexible, asynchronous video generation. Specifically, our approach leverages diffusion to gradually corrupt video frames in both training and inference, reducing the discrepancy between these phases. Inspired by auto-regressive generation, we incorporate a non-decreasing constraint on the corruption timesteps of individual frames, ensuring that earlier frames remain clearer than subsequent ones. This setup, together with temporal causal attention, enables flexible generation of videos with varying lengths while preserving temporal coherence. In addition, we design two specialized timestep schedulers: the FoPP scheduler for balanced timestep sampling during training, and the AD scheduler for flexible timestep differences during inference, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves competitive and state-of-the-art results across four challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) planning. MovieAgent offers two key advantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated movie/long-video generation. Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent can generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent narrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and stable audio throughout the film. 2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical CoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings, and cinematography, significantly reducing human effort. By employing multiple LLM agents to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter, storyboard artist, and location manager, MovieAgent streamlines the production pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that MovieAgent achieves new state-of-the-art results in script faithfulness, character consistency, and narrative coherence. Our hierarchical framework takes a step forward and provides new insights into fully automated movie generation.

In this paper, we explore the task of learning to animate images to portray delicate human actions using a small number of videos -- 16 or fewer -- which is highly valuable for real-world applications like video and movie production. Learning generalizable motion patterns that smoothly transition from user-provided reference images in a few-shot setting is highly challenging. We propose FLASH (Few-shot Learning to Animate and Steer Humans), which learns generalizable motion patterns by forcing the model to reconstruct a video using the motion features and cross-frame correspondences of another video with the same motion but different appearance. This encourages transferable motion learning and mitigates overfitting to limited training data. Additionally, FLASH extends the decoder with additional layers to propagate details from the reference image to generated frames, improving transition smoothness. Human judges overwhelmingly favor FLASH, with 65.78\% of 488 responses prefer FLASH over baselines. We strongly recommend watching the videos in the website: https://lihaoxin05.github.io/human_action_animation/, as motion artifacts are hard to notice from images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Dreamer: Boundary Conditional Motion Reasoning for Physically Coherent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00547v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation have shown promise for generating future scenarios, critical for planning and control in autonomous driving and embodied intelligence. However, real-world applications demand more than visually plausible predictions; they require reasoning about object motions based on explicitly defined boundary conditions, such as initial scene image and partial object motion. We term this capability Boundary Conditional Motion Reasoning. Current approaches either neglect explicit user-defined motion constraints, producing physically inconsistent motions, or conversely demand complete motion inputs, which are rarely available in practice. Here we introduce Motion Dreamer, a two-stage framework that explicitly separates motion reasoning from visual synthesis, addressing these limitations. Our approach introduces instance flow, a sparse-to-dense motion representation enabling effective integration of partial user-defined motions, and the motion inpainting strategy to robustly enable reasoning motions of other objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Motion Dreamer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior motion plausibility and visual realism, thus bridging the gap towards practical boundary conditional motion reasoning.

| **[E2ED^2:Direct Mapping from Noise to Data for Enhanced Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21044v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have established themselves as the de facto primary paradigm in visual generative modeling, revolutionizing the field through remarkable success across various diverse applications ranging from high-quality image synthesis to temporal aware video generation. Despite these advancements, three fundamental limitations persist, including 1) discrepancy between training and inference processes, 2) progressive information leakage throughout the noise corruption procedures, and 3) inherent constraints preventing effective integration of modern optimization criteria like perceptual and adversarial loss. To mitigate these critical challenges, we in this paper present a novel end-to-end learning paradigm that establishes direct optimization from the final generated samples to initial noises. Our proposed End-to-End Differentiable Diffusion, dubbed E2ED^2, introduces several key improvements: it eliminates the sequential training-sampling mismatch and intermediate information leakage via conceptualizing training as a direct transformation from isotropic Gaussian noise to the target data distribution. Additionally, such training framework enables seamless incorporation of adversarial and perceptual losses into the core optimization objective. Comprehensive evaluation across standard benchmarks including COCO30K and HW30K reveals that our method achieves substantial performance gains in terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP score, even with fewer sampling steps (less than 4). Our findings highlight that the end-to-end mechanism might pave the way for more robust and efficient solutions, \emph{i.e.,} combining diffusion stability with GAN-like discriminative optimization in an end-to-end manner.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[VideoPhy-2: A Challenging Action-Centric Physical Commonsense Evaluation in Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06800v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video generative models, capable of creating realistic videos of diverse visual concepts, are strong candidates for general-purpose physical world simulators. However, their adherence to physical commonsense across real-world actions remains unclear (e.g., playing tennis, backflip). Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations such as limited size, lack of human evaluation, sim-to-real gaps, and absence of fine-grained physical rule analysis. To address this, we introduce VideoPhy-2, an action-centric dataset for evaluating physical commonsense in generated videos. We curate 200 diverse actions and detailed prompts for video synthesis from modern generative models. We perform human evaluation that assesses semantic adherence, physical commonsense, and grounding of physical rules in the generated videos. Our findings reveal major shortcomings, with even the best model achieving only 22% joint performance (i.e., high semantic and physical commonsense adherence) on the hard subset of VideoPhy-2. We find that the models particularly struggle with conservation laws like mass and momentum. Finally, we also train VideoPhy-AutoEval, an automatic evaluator for fast, reliable assessment on our dataset. Overall, VideoPhy-2 serves as a rigorous benchmark, exposing critical gaps in video generative models and guiding future research in physically-grounded video generation.

However, they are still hard to meet requirements of applications due to unsatisfied generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose to align video foundation models with human preferences from the perspective of post-training in this paper. Consequently, we introduce an Iterative Preference Optimization strategy to enhance generated video quality by incorporating human feedback. Specifically, IPO exploits a critic model to justify video generations for pairwise ranking as in Direct Preference Optimization or point-wise scoring as in Kahneman-Tversky Optimization. Given this, IPO optimizes video foundation models with guidance of signals from preference feedback, which helps improve generated video quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. In addition, IPO incorporates the critic model with the multi-modality large language model, which enables it to automatically assign preference labels without need of retraining or relabeling. In this way, IPO can efficiently perform multi-round preference optimization in an iterative manner, without the need of tediously manual labeling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IPO can effectively improve the video generation quality of a pretrained model and help a model with only 2B parameters surpass the one with 5B parameters. Besides, IPO achieves new state-of-the-art performance on VBench benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, when applied to human data, existing methods have yet to deliver promising results, largely due to the challenges of scaling multiview attention to higher resolutions. In this paper, we explore human multiview diffusion models at the megapixel level and introduce a solution called mesh attention to enable training at 1024x1024 resolution. Using a clothed human mesh as a central coarse geometric representation, the proposed mesh attention leverages rasterization and projection to establish direct cross-view coordinate correspondences. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of multiview attention while maintaining cross-view consistency. Building on this foundation, we devise a mesh attention block and combine it with keypoint conditioning to create our human-specific multiview diffusion model, MEAT. In addition, we present valuable insights into applying multiview human motion videos for diffusion training, addressing the longstanding issue of data scarcity. Extensive experiments show that MEAT effectively generates dense, consistent multiview human images at the megapixel level, outperforming existing multiview diffusion methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

However, the T2I models that underpin these methods have become outdated, thereby limiting the potential for further improvement in VTO. Additionally, current methods face notable challenges in accurately rendering text on garments without distortion and preserving fine-grained details, such as textures and material fidelity. The emergence of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) based T2I models has showcased impressive performance and offers a promising opportunity for advancing VTO. Directly applying existing VTO techniques to transformer-based T2I models is ineffective due to substantial architectural differences, which hinder their ability to fully leverage the models' advanced capabilities for improved text generation. To address these challenges and unlock the full potential of DiT-based T2I models for VTO, we propose TED-VITON, a novel framework that integrates a Garment Semantic (GS) Adapter for enhancing garment-specific features, a Text Preservation Loss to ensure accurate and distortion-free text rendering, and a constraint mechanism to generate prompts by optimizing Large Language Model (LLM). These innovations enable state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in visual quality and text fidelity, establishing a new benchmark for VTO task.

Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical concepts such as Markov chains and SDEs. 3) Guided by this simple framework, more efficient inference methods can be discovered.</p></details> |  |

Our method optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts using pretrained diffusion models. Our key insight is to leverage 2D inpainting diffusion models conditioned on an initial scene estimate to provide low variance supervision for unknown regions during 3D distillation. In conjunction, we imbue high-fidelity geometry with geometric distillation from a depth diffusion model, conditioned on samples from the inpainting model. We find that the initialization of the optimization is crucial, and provide a principled methodology for doing so. Notably, our technique doesn't require video or multi-view data and can synthesize various high-quality 3D scenes in different styles with complex layouts. Further, the generality of our method allows 3D synthesis from a single image. As measured by a comprehensive user study, our method outperforms all existing approaches, preferred by 88-95%.

In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

| **[Modular Customization of Diffusion Models via Blockwise-Parameterized Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08575v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion model customization has shown impressive results in incorporating subject or style concepts with a handful of images. However, the modular composition of multiple concepts into a customized model, aimed to efficiently merge decentralized-trained concepts without influencing their identities, remains unresolved. Modular customization is essential for applications like concept stylization and multi-concept customization using concepts trained by different users. Existing post-training methods are only confined to a fixed set of concepts, and any different combinations require a new round of retraining. In contrast, instant merging methods often cause identity loss and interference of individual merged concepts and are usually limited to a small number of concepts. To address these issues, we propose BlockLoRA, an instant merging method designed to efficiently combine multiple concepts while accurately preserving individual concepts' identity. With a careful analysis of the underlying reason for interference, we develop the Randomized Output Erasure technique to minimize the interference of different customized models. Additionally, Blockwise LoRA Parameterization is proposed to reduce the identity loss during instant model merging. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BlockLoRA, which can instantly merge 15 concepts of people, subjects, scenes, and styles with high fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Posterior-Mean Denoising Diffusion Model for Realistic PET Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08546v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that enables the visualization of biochemical and physiological processes across various tissues. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have demonstrated significant progress in directly mapping sinograms to PET images. However, regression-based DL models often yield overly smoothed reconstructions lacking of details (i.e., low distortion, low perceptual quality), whereas GAN-based and likelihood-based posterior sampling models tend to introduce undesirable artifacts in predictions (i.e., high distortion, high perceptual quality), limiting their clinical applicability. To achieve a robust perception-distortion tradeoff, we propose Posterior-Mean Denoising Diffusion Model (PMDM-PET), a novel approach that builds upon a recently established mathematical theory to explore the closed-form expression of perception-distortion function in diffusion model space for PET image reconstruction from sinograms. Specifically, PMDM-PET first obtained posterior-mean PET predictions under minimum mean square error (MSE), then optimally transports the distribution of them to the ground-truth PET images distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that PMDM-PET not only generates realistic PET images with possible minimum distortion and optimal perceptual quality but also outperforms five recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL baselines in both qualitative visual inspection and quantitative pixel-wise metrics PSNR (dB)/SSIM/NRMSE.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |
| **[PointDiffuse: A Dual-Conditional Diffusion Model for Enhanced Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06094v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion probabilistic models are traditionally used to generate colors at fixed pixel positions in 2D images. Building on this, we extend diffusion models to point cloud semantic segmentation, where point positions also remain fixed, and the diffusion model generates point labels instead of colors. To accelerate the denoising process in reverse diffusion, we introduce a noisy label embedding mechanism. This approach integrates semantic information into the noisy label, providing an initial semantic reference that improves the reverse diffusion efficiency. Additionally, we propose a point frequency transformer that enhances the adjustment of high-level context in point clouds. To reduce computational complexity, we introduce the position condition into MLP and propose denoising PointNet to process the high-resolution point cloud without sacrificing geometric details. Finally, we integrate the proposed noisy label embedding, point frequency transformer and denoising PointNet in our proposed dual conditional diffusion model-based network (PointDiffuse) to perform large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of PointDiffuse, achieving the state-of-the-art mIoU of 74.2\% on S3DIS Area 5, 81.2\% on S3DIS 6-fold and 64.8\% on SWAN dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Chemistry-Inspired Diffusion with Non-Differentiable Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06502v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in the conditional generation of novel molecules. These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Neural Switching via Drift-Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00781v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural encoding is a field in neuroscience that focuses on characterizing how information from stimuli is encoded in the spiking activity of neurons. When more than one stimulus is present, a theory known as multiplexing posits that neurons temporally switch between encoding various stimuli, creating a fluctuating firing pattern. Here, we propose a new statistical framework to analyze rate fluctuations and discern whether neurons employ multiplexing as a means of encoding multiple stimuli. We adopt a mechanistic approach to modeling multiplexing by constructing a non-Markovian endogenous state-space model. Specifically, we posit that multiplexing arises from competition between the stimuli, which are modeled as latent drift-diffusion processes. We propose a new MCMC algorithm for conducting posterior inference on similar types of state-space models, where typical state-space MCMC methods fail due to strong dependence between the parameters. In addition, we develop alternative models that represent a wide class of alternative encoding theories and perform model comparison using WAIC to determine whether the data suggest the occurrence multiplexing over alternative theories of neural encoding. Using the proposed framework, we provide evidence of multiplexing within the inferior colliculus and novel insight into the switching dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure Preserving Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19369v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, diffusion models have become the leading approach for distribution learning. This paper focuses on structure-preserving diffusion models (SPDM), a specific subset of diffusion processes tailored for distributions with inherent structures, such as group symmetries. We complement existing sufficient conditions for constructing SPDMs by proving complementary necessary ones. Additionally, we propose a new framework that considers the geometric structures affecting the diffusion process. Leveraging this framework, we design a structure-preserving bridge model that maintains alignment between the model's endpoint couplings. Empirical evaluations on equivariant diffusion models demonstrate their effectiveness in learning symmetric distributions and modeling transitions between them. Experiments on real-world medical images confirm that our models preserve equivariance while maintaining high sample quality. We also showcase the practical utility of our framework by implementing an equivariant denoising diffusion bridge model, which achieves reliable equivariant image noise reduction and style transfer, irrespective of prior knowledge of image orientation.</p></details> |  |

We propose a robotic system to facilitate autonomous DRS scanning with hybrid visual servoing control. A specially designed height compensation module enables precise contact condition control. The evaluation results show that the system can accurately execute the scanning command and acquire consistent DRS spectra with comparable results to the manual collection, which is the current gold standard protocol. Integrating the proposed system into surgery lays the groundwork for autonomous intra-operative DRS tissue assessment with high reliability and repeatability. This could reduce the need for manual scanning by the surgeon while ensuring complete tumor removal in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Controlling Latent Diffusion Using Latent CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08455v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instead of performing text-conditioned denoising in the image domain, latent diffusion models (LDMs) operate in latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE), enabling more efficient processing at reduced computational costs. However, while the diffusion process has moved to the latent space, the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models, as used in many image processing tasks, still operate in pixel space. Doing so requires costly VAE-decoding of latent images before they can be processed. In this paper, we introduce Latent-CLIP, a CLIP model that operates directly in the latent space. We train Latent-CLIP on 2.7B pairs of latent images and descriptive texts, and show that it matches zero-shot classification performance of similarly sized CLIP models on both the ImageNet benchmark and a LDM-generated version of it, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing both real and generated content. Furthermore, we construct Latent-CLIP rewards for reward-based noise optimization (ReNO) and show that they match the performance of their CLIP counterparts on GenEval and T2I-CompBench while cutting the cost of the total pipeline by 21%. Finally, we use Latent-CLIP to guide generation away from harmful content, achieving strong performance on the inappropriate image prompts (I2P) benchmark and a custom evaluation, without ever requiring the costly step of decoding intermediate images.</p></details> |  |

This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently altering the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. By grounding depth-of-field adjustments, our method preserves the underlying scene structure as the level of blur is varied. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves flexible, lens-like blur control but also supports applications such as real image editing via inversion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://atfortes.github.io/projects/bokeh-diffusion/</p></details> |
| **[Using Powerful Prior Knowledge of Diffusion Model in Deep Unfolding Networks for Image Compressive Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08429v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) have achieved impressive reconstruction quality in the field of image Compressive Sensing (CS) by unfolding iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks. The reconstruction quality of DUNs depends on the learned prior knowledge, so introducing stronger prior knowledge can further improve reconstruction quality. On the other hand, pre-trained diffusion models contain powerful prior knowledge and have a solid theoretical foundation and strong scalability, but it requires a large number of iterative steps to achieve reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to use the powerful prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model in DUNs to achieve high-quality reconstruction with less steps for image CS. Specifically, we first design an iterative optimization algorithm named Diffusion Message Passing (DMP), which embeds a pre-trained diffusion model into each iteration process of DMP. Then, we deeply unfold the DMP algorithm into a neural network named DMP-DUN. The proposed DMP-DUN can use lightweight neural networks to achieve mapping from measurement data to the intermediate steps of the reverse diffusion process and directly approximate the divergence of the diffusion model, thereby further improving reconstruction efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our proposed DMP-DUN achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires at least only 2 steps to reconstruct the image.

A recent family for these improvements uses diffusion models, which have become essential for achieving high-quality video inpainting results, yet they still face performance bottlenecks in temporal consistency and computational efficiency. This motivates us to propose a new video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided Efficient Diffusion (FloED) for higher video coherence. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where the time-agnostic flow branch restores corrupted flow first, and the multi-scale flow adapters provide motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Besides, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. With the flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the computational cost of incorporating optical flow. Extensive experiments on background restoration and object removal tasks show that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in both quality and efficiency.

However, most existing style transfer methods can only render consistent artistic stylized images, making it difficult for users to get enough stylized images to enjoy. To solve this issue, we propose a novel artistic style transfer framework called DyArtbank, which can generate diverse and highly realistic artistic stylized images. Specifically, we introduce a Dynamic Style Prompt ArtBank (DSPA), a set of learnable parameters. It can learn and store the style information from the collection of artworks, dynamically guiding pre-trained stable diffusion to generate diverse and highly realistic artistic stylized images. DSPA can also generate random artistic image samples with the learned style information, providing a new idea for data augmentation.

A common solution is to leverage the feedback provided by quality assessment systems or human annotators to optimize the model, where images are generally rated in their entirety. In this work, we believe problem-solving starts with identification, yielding the request that the model should be aware of not just the presence of defects in an image, but their specific locations. Motivated by this, we propose DiffDoctor, a two-stage pipeline to assist image diffusion models in generating fewer artifacts. Concretely, the first stage targets developing a robust artifact detector, for which we collect a dataset of over 1M flawed synthesized images and set up an efficient human-in-the-loop annotation process, incorporating a carefully designed class-balance strategy. The learned artifact detector is then involved in the second stage to optimize the diffusion model by providing pixel-level feedback. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness of our artifact detector as well as the soundness of our diagnose-then-treat design.</p></details> | 8 pages of main body |

Traditional methods often utilize masks for inpainting tasks, but their incorporation into PET reconstruction frameworks introduces transformative potential. In this study, we pro-pose an advanced PET reconstruction framework called Diffusion tRansformer mEets rAndom Masks (DREAM). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate mask mechanisms into both the sinogram domain and the latent space, pioneering their role in PET reconstruction and demonstrating their ability to enhance reconstruction fidelity and efficiency. The framework employs a high-dimensional stacking approach, transforming masked data from two to three dimensions to expand the solution space and enable the model to capture richer spatial rela-tionships. Additionally, a mask-driven latent space is de-signed to accelerate the diffusion process by leveraging sinogram-driven and mask-driven compact priors, which reduce computational complexity while preserving essen-tial data characteristics. A hierarchical masking strategy is also introduced, guiding the model from focusing on fi-ne-grained local details in the early stages to capturing broader global patterns over time. This progressive ap-proach ensures a balance between detailed feature preservation and comprehensive context understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that DREAM not only improves the overall quality of reconstructed PET images but also preserves critical clinical details, highlighting its potential to advance PET imaging technology. By inte-grating compact priors and hierarchical masking, DREAM offers a promising and efficient avenue for future research and application in PET imaging.

However, aligning discrete diffusion models with task-specific preferences remains challenging, particularly in scenarios where explicit reward functions are unavailable. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion DPO (D3PO), the first adaptation of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to discrete diffusion models formulated as continuous-time Markov chains. Our approach derives a novel loss function that directly fine-tunes the generative process using preference data while preserving fidelity to a reference distribution. We validate D3PO on a structured binary sequence generation task, demonstrating that the method effectively aligns model outputs with preferences while maintaining structural validity. Our results highlight that D3PO enables controlled fine-tuning without requiring explicit reward models, making it a practical alternative to reinforcement learning-based approaches. Future research will explore extending D3PO to more complex generative tasks, including language modeling and protein sequence generation, as well as investigating alternative noise schedules, such as uniform noising, to enhance flexibility across different applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a co-learning framework that jointly optimizes a single-step diffusion-based upsampler and a learnable downsampler, enhanced by two discriminators and a cyclic distillation strategy. Our learnable downsampler is designed to better capture realistic degradation patterns while preserving structural details in the LR domain, which is crucial for enhancing SR performance. By leveraging a diffusion-based approach, our model generates diverse LR-HR pairs during training, enabling robust learning across varying degradations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both general real-world and domain-specific face SR tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Our approach not only improves efficiency with a single inference step but also ensures high-quality image reconstruction, bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world SR scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[OminiControl2: Efficient Conditioning for Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08280v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained control of text-to-image diffusion transformer models (DiT) remains a critical challenge for practical deployment. While recent advances such as OminiControl and others have enabled a controllable generation of diverse control signals, these methods face significant computational inefficiency when handling long conditional inputs. We present OminiControl2, an efficient framework that achieves efficient image-conditional image generation. OminiControl2 introduces two key innovations: (1) a dynamic compression strategy that streamlines conditional inputs by preserving only the most semantically relevant tokens during generation, and (2) a conditional feature reuse mechanism that computes condition token features only once and reuses them across denoising steps. These architectural improvements preserve the original framework's parameter efficiency and multi-modal versatility while dramatically reducing computational costs. Our experiments demonstrate that OminiControl2 reduces conditional processing overhead by over 90% compared to its predecessor, achieving an overall 5.9$\times$ speedup in multi-conditional generation scenarios. This efficiency enables the practical implementation of complex, multi-modal control for high-quality image synthesis with DiT models.</p></details> |  |
| **[OminiControl: Minimal and Universal Control for Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15098v5)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present OminiControl, a novel approach that rethinks how image conditions are integrated into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures. Current image conditioning methods either introduce substantial parameter overhead or handle only specific control tasks effectively, limiting their practical versatility. OminiControl addresses these limitations through three key innovations: (1) a minimal architectural design that leverages the DiT's own VAE encoder and transformer blocks, requiring just 0.1% additional parameters; (2) a unified sequence processing strategy that combines condition tokens with image tokens for flexible token interactions; and (3) a dynamic position encoding mechanism that adapts to both spatially-aligned and non-aligned control tasks. Our extensive experiments show that this streamlined approach not only matches but surpasses the performance of specialized methods across multiple conditioning tasks. To overcome data limitations in subject-driven generation, we also introduce Subjects200K, a large-scale dataset of identity-consistent image pairs synthesized using DiT models themselves. This work demonstrates that effective image control can be achieved without architectural complexity, opening new possibilities for efficient and versatile image generation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARA: Structural and Adversarial Representation Alignment for Training-efficient Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08253v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern diffusion models encounter a fundamental trade-off between training efficiency and generation quality. While existing representation alignment methods, such as REPA, accelerate convergence through patch-wise alignment, they often fail to capture structural relationships within visual representations and ensure global distribution consistency between pretrained encoders and denoising networks. To address these limitations, we introduce SARA, a hierarchical alignment framework that enforces multi-level representation constraints: (1) patch-wise alignment to preserve local semantic details, (2) autocorrelation matrix alignment to maintain structural consistency within representations, and (3) adversarial distribution alignment to mitigate global representation discrepancies. Unlike previous approaches, SARA explicitly models both intra-representation correlations via self-similarity matrices and inter-distribution coherence via adversarial alignment, enabling comprehensive alignment across local and global scales. Experiments on ImageNet-256 show that SARA achieves an FID of 1.36 while converging twice as fast as REPA, surpassing recent state-of-the-art image generation methods. This work establishes a systematic paradigm for optimizing diffusion training through hierarchical representation alignment.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Aligning Text to Image in Diffusion Models is Easier Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08250v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</p></details> |  |

Recently, some methods have resorted to diffusion models for guidance, optimizing a 3D representation via Score Distillation Sampling(SDS) or generating one back-view image for facilitating reconstruction. However, these methods tend to produce unsatisfactory artifacts (\textit{e.g.} flattened human structure or over-smoothing results caused by inconsistent priors from multiple views) and struggle with real-world generalization in the wild. In this work, we present \emph{MVD-HuGaS}, enabling free-view 3D human rendering from a single image via a multi-view human diffusion model. We first generate multi-view images from the single reference image with an enhanced multi-view diffusion model, which is well fine-tuned on high-quality 3D human datasets to incorporate 3D geometry priors and human structure priors. To infer accurate camera poses from the sparse generated multi-view images for reconstruction, an alignment module is introduced to facilitate joint optimization of 3D Gaussians and camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a depth-based Facial Distortion Mitigation module to refine the generated facial regions, thereby improving the overall fidelity of the reconstruction.Finally, leveraging the refined multi-view images, along with their accurate camera poses, MVD-HuGaS optimizes the 3D Gaussians of the target human for high-fidelity free-view renderings. Extensive experiments on Thuman2.0 and 2K2K datasets show that the proposed MVD-HuGaS achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-view 3D human rendering.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose AnomalyPainter, a zero-shot framework that breaks the diversity-realism trade-off dilemma through synergizing Vision Language Large Model (VLLM), Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), and our newly introduced texture library Tex-9K. Tex-9K is a professional texture library containing 75 categories and 8,792 texture assets crafted for diverse anomaly synthesis. Leveraging VLLM's general knowledge, reasonable anomaly text descriptions are generated for each industrial object and matched with relevant diverse textures from Tex-9K. These textures then guide the LDM via ControlNet to paint on normal images. Furthermore, we introduce Texture-Aware Latent Init to stabilize the natural-image-trained ControlNet for industrial images. Extensive experiments show that AnomalyPainter outperforms existing methods in realism, diversity, and generalization, achieving superior downstream performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>anoma...</summary><p>anomaly synthesis,anomaly detection</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Guided Diffusion Models for Adversarial Purification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16067v5)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion model (DM) based adversarial purification (AP) has proven to be a powerful defense method that can remove adversarial perturbations and generate a purified example without threats. In principle, the pre-trained DMs can only ensure that purified examples conform to the same distribution of the training data, but it may inadvertently compromise the semantic information of input examples, leading to misclassification of purified examples. Recent advancements introduce guided diffusion techniques to preserve semantic information while removing the perturbations. However, these guidances often rely on distance measures between purified examples and diffused examples, which can also preserve perturbations in purified examples. To further unleash the robustness power of DM-based AP, we propose an adversarial guided diffusion model (AGDM) by introducing a novel adversarial guidance that contains sufficient semantic information but does not explicitly involve adversarial perturbations. The guidance is modeled by an auxiliary neural network obtained with adversarial training, considering the distance in the latent representations rather than at the pixel-level values. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet to demonstrate that our method is effective for simultaneously maintaining semantic information and removing the adversarial perturbations. In addition, comprehensive comparisons show that our method significantly enhances the robustness of existing DM-based AP, with an average robust accuracy improved by up to 7.30% on CIFAR-10.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single Image Rolling Shutter Removal with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02906v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RS-Diffusion, the first Diffusion Models-based method for single-frame Rolling Shutter (RS) correction. RS artifacts compromise visual quality of frames due to the row-wise exposure of CMOS sensors. Most previous methods have focused on multi-frame approaches, using temporal information from consecutive frames for the motion rectification. However, few approaches address the more challenging but important single frame RS correction. In this work, we present an ``image-to-motion" framework via diffusion techniques, with a designed patch-attention module. In addition, we present the RS-Real dataset, comprised of captured RS frames alongside their corresponding Global Shutter (GS) ground-truth pairs. The GS frames are corrected from the RS ones, guided by the corresponding Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) gyroscope data acquired during capture. Experiments show that RS-Diffusion surpasses previous single-frame RS methods, demonstrates the potential of diffusion-based approaches, and provides a valuable dataset for further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[U-StyDiT: Ultra-high Quality Artistic Style Transfer Using Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08157v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-high quality artistic style transfer refers to repainting an ultra-high quality content image using the style information learned from the style image. Existing artistic style transfer methods can be categorized into style reconstruction-based and content-style disentanglement-based style transfer approaches. Although these methods can generate some artistic stylized images, they still exhibit obvious artifacts and disharmonious patterns, which hinder their ability to produce ultra-high quality artistic stylized images. To address these issues, we propose a novel artistic image style transfer method, U-StyDiT, which is built on transformer-based diffusion (DiT) and learns content-style disentanglement, generating ultra-high quality artistic stylized images. Specifically, we first design a Multi-view Style Modulator (MSM) to learn style information from a style image from local and global perspectives, conditioning U-StyDiT to generate stylized images with the learned style information. Then, we introduce a StyDiT Block to learn content and style conditions simultaneously from a style image. Additionally, we propose an ultra-high quality artistic image dataset, Aes4M, comprising 10 categories, each containing 400,000 style images. This dataset effectively solves the problem that the existing style transfer methods cannot produce high-quality artistic stylized images due to the size of the dataset and the quality of the images in the dataset. Finally, the extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments validate that our U-StyDiT can create higher quality stylized images compared to state-of-the-art artistic style transfer methods. To our knowledge, our proposed method is the first to address the generation of ultra-high quality stylized images using transformer-based diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularization by Texts for Latent Diffusion Inverse Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15658v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of diffusion models has led to significant progress in solving inverse problems by leveraging these models as powerful generative priors. However, challenges persist due to the ill-posed nature of such problems, often arising from ambiguities in measurements or intrinsic system symmetries. To address this, here we introduce a novel latent diffusion inverse solver, regularization by text (TReg), inspired by the human ability to resolve visual ambiguities through perceptual biases. TReg integrates textual descriptions of preconceptions about the solution during reverse diffusion sampling, dynamically reinforcing these descriptions through null-text optimization, which we refer to as adaptive negation. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that TReg effectively mitigates ambiguity in inverse problems, improving both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

However, applying existing RL methods to step-distilled DMs is challenging for ultra-fast ($\le2$-step) image generation. Our analysis suggests several limitations of policy-based RL methods such as PPO or DPO toward this goal. Based on the insights, we propose fine-tuning DMs with learned differentiable surrogate rewards. Our method, named LaSRO, learns surrogate reward models in the latent space of SDXL to convert arbitrary rewards into differentiable ones for effective reward gradient guidance. LaSRO leverages pre-trained latent DMs for reward modeling and tailors reward optimization for $\le2$-step image generation with efficient off-policy exploration. LaSRO is effective and stable for improving ultra-fast image generation with different reward objectives, outperforming popular RL methods including DDPO and Diffusion-DPO. We further show LaSRO's connection to value-based RL, providing theoretical insights. See our webpage \href{https://sites.google.com/view/lasro}{here}.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Attentive Eraser: Unleashing Diffusion Model's Object Removal Potential via Self-Attention Redirection Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12974v4)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have emerged as promising newcomers in the field of generative models, shining brightly in image generation. However, when employed for object removal tasks, they still encounter issues such as generating random artifacts and the incapacity to repaint foreground object areas with appropriate content after removal. To tackle these problems, we propose Attentive Eraser, a tuning-free method to empower pre-trained diffusion models for stable and effective object removal. Firstly, in light of the observation that the self-attention maps influence the structure and shape details of the generated images, we propose Attention Activation and Suppression (ASS), which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism within the pre-trained diffusion models based on the given mask, thereby prioritizing the background over the foreground object during the reverse generation process. Moreover, we introduce Self-Attention Redirection Guidance (SARG), which utilizes the self-attention redirected by ASS to guide the generation process, effectively removing foreground objects within the mask while simultaneously generating content that is both plausible and coherent. Experiments demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of Attentive Eraser in object removal across a variety of pre-trained diffusion models, outperforming even training-based methods. Furthermore, Attentive Eraser can be implemented in various diffusion model architectures and checkpoints, enabling excellent scalability.

Despite their capabilities, these models face persistent challenges in generating realistic human hands, often producing images with incorrect finger counts and structurally deformed hands. MGHanD addresses this challenge by applying multi-modal guidance during the inference process. For visual guidance, we employ a discriminator trained on a dataset comprising paired real and generated images with captions, derived from various hand-in-the-wild datasets. We also employ textual guidance with LoRA adapter, which learns the direction from `hands' towards more detailed prompts such as `natural hands', and `anatomically correct fingers' at the latent level. A cumulative hand mask which is gradually enlarged in the assigned time step is applied to the added guidance, allowing the hand to be refined while maintaining the rich generative capabilities of the pre-trained model. In the experiments, our method achieves superior hand generation qualities, without any specific conditions or priors. We carry out both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with user studies, to showcase the benefits of our approach in producing high-quality hand images.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

We investigate the well-posedness, stability, and error estimates of the scheme. In particular, we demonstrate that the $L^2$-norm error of the conformation tensor is independent of the reciprocal of $\ep$. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical convergence rates. Our numerical examples show that the HDG scheme performs better in preserving the positive definiteness of the conformation tensor compared to the ordinary finite element method (FEM).</p></details> |  |

While concept editing is proposed to address these issues, they often struggle to balance the removal of unsafe concept with maintaining the model's general genera-tive capabilities. In this work, we propose ACE, a new editing method that enhances concept editing in diffusion models. ACE introduces a novel cross null-space projection approach to precisely erase unsafe concept while maintaining the model's ability to generate high-quality, semantically consistent images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACE significantly outperforms the advancing baselines,improving semantic consistency by 24.56% and image generation quality by 34.82% on average with only 1% of the time cost. These results highlight the practical utility of concept editing by mitigating its potential risks, paving the way for broader applications in the field.

| **[Boosting Diffusion-Based Text Image Super-Resolution Model Towards Generalized Real-World Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07232v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Restoring low-resolution text images presents a significant challenge, as it requires maintaining both the fidelity and stylistic realism of the text in restored images. Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

We present four key contributions to address the challenges of spatiotemporal video processing. First, we introduce the 3D Mobile Inverted Vector-Quantization Variational Autoencoder (3D-MBQ-VAE), which combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with masked token modeling to enhance spatiotemporal video compression. The model achieves superior temporal consistency and state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality by employing a novel training strategy with full frame masking. Second, we present MotionAura, a text-to-video generation framework that utilizes vector-quantized diffusion models to discretize the latent space and capture complex motion dynamics, producing temporally coherent videos aligned with text prompts. Third, we propose a spectral transformer-based denoising network that processes video data in the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform. This method effectively captures global context and long-range dependencies for high-quality video generation and denoising. Lastly, we introduce a downstream task of Sketch Guided Video Inpainting. This task leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our models achieve SOTA performance on a range of benchmarks.

| **[Computational bottlenecks for denoising diffusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08028v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusions provide a general strategy to sample from a probability distribution $\mu$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by constructing a stochastic process $(\hat{\boldsymbol x}_t:t\ge 0)$ in ${\mathbb R}^d$ such that the distribution of $\hat{\boldsymbol x}_T$ at large times $T$ approximates $\mu$. The drift ${\boldsymbol m}:{\mathbb R}^d\times{\mathbb R}\to{\mathbb R}^d$ of this diffusion process is learned from data (samples from $\mu$) by minimizing the so-called score-matching objective. In order for the generating process to be efficient, it must be possible to evaluate (an approximation of) ${\boldsymbol m}({\boldsymbol y},t)$ in polynomial time. Is every probability distribution $\mu$, for which sampling is tractable, also amenable to sampling via diffusions? We provide evidence to the contrary by constructing a probability distribution $\mu$ for which sampling is easy, but the drift of the diffusion process is intractable -- under a popular conjecture on information-computation gaps in statistical estimation. We further show that any polynomial-time computable drift can be modified in a way that changes minimally the score matching objective and yet results in incorrect sampling.</p></details> | 36 pages |

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method capable of influence estimation for DMs with billions of parameters. Leveraging efficient gradient compression, DMin reduces storage requirements from hundreds of TBs to mere MBs or even KBs, and retrieves the top-k most influential training samples in under 1 second, all while maintaining performance. Our empirical results demonstrate DMin is both effective in identifying influential training samples and efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables.

| **[DiffEGG: Diffusion-Driven Edge Generation as a Pixel-Annotation-Free Alternative for Instance Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07982v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise panoptic segmentation relies on pixel-wise instance annotations, but obtaining such datasets is costly. Unsupervised instance segmentation (UIS) eliminates annotation requirements but struggles with adjacent instance merging and single-instance fragmentation, largely due to the limitations of DINO-based backbones which lack strong instance separation cues. Weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation (WPS) reduces annotation costs using sparse labels (e.g., points, boxes), yet these annotations remain expensive and introduce human bias and boundary errors. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEGG (Diffusion-Driven EdGe Generation), a fully annotation-free method that extracts instance-aware features from pretrained diffusion models to generate precise instance edge maps. Unlike DINO-based UIS methods, diffusion models inherently capture fine-grained, instance-aware features, enabling more precise boundary delineation. For WPS, DiffEGG eliminates annotation costs and human bias by operating without any form of manual supervision, addressing the key limitations of prior best methods. Additionally, we introduce RIP, a post-processing technique that fuses DiffEGG's edge maps with segmentation masks in a task-agnostic manner. RIP allows DiffEGG to be seamlessly integrated into various segmentation frameworks. When applied to UIS, DiffEGG and RIP achieve an average $+4.4\text{ AP}$ improvement over prior best UIS methods. When combined with weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSS), DiffEGG enables WPS without instance annotations, outperforming prior best point-supervised WPS methods by $+1.7\text{ PQ}$. These results demonstrate that DiffEGG's edge maps serve as a cost-effective, annotation-free alternative to instance annotations, significantly improving segmentation without human intervention.

The core idea behind them is learning to reverse the process of gradually adding noise to images, allowing them to generate high-quality samples from a complex distribution. In this survey, we provide an exhaustive overview of existing methods using diffusion models for image editing, covering both theoretical and practical aspects in the field. We delve into a thorough analysis and categorization of these works from multiple perspectives, including learning strategies, user-input conditions, and the array of specific editing tasks that can be accomplished.

| **[Can Generative Geospatial Diffusion Models Excel as Discriminative Geospatial Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07890v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily focus on discriminative objectives, such as contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models--which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation--remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional diffusions for neural posterior estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19105v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based computational approach for Bayesian inference, has shown great success in approximating complex posterior distributions. Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing flows, which approximate a distribution by composing many simple, invertible transformations. But flow-based models, while state of the art for NPE, are known to suffer from several limitations, including training instability and sharp trade-offs between representational power and computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions coupled with high-capacity summary networks for amortized NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods. Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models. Building on prior work on diffusions for NPE, we show that these gains persist across a variety of different summary network architectures.

The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that facilitates bidirectional information exchange between video and audio diffusion models through temporally-aligned self attention operations. Unlike prior work that uses dedicated models for A2V and V2A tasks and relies on pretrained feature extractors, AV-Link achieves both tasks in a single self-contained framework, directly leveraging features obtained by the complementary modality (i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video). Extensive automatic and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial improvement in audio-video synchronization, outperforming more expensive baselines such as the MovieGen video-to-audio model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: snap-research.github.io/AVLink/</p></details> |
| **[Denoising Score Distillation: From Noisy Diffusion Pretraining to One-Step High-Quality Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07578v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-resolution, realistic images across diverse natural distributions. However, their performance heavily relies on high-quality training data, making it challenging to learn meaningful distributions from corrupted samples. This limitation restricts their applicability in scientific domains where clean data is scarce or costly to obtain. In this work, we introduce denoising score distillation (DSD), a surprisingly effective and novel approach for training high-quality generative models from low-quality data. DSD first pretrains a diffusion model exclusively on noisy, corrupted samples and then distills it into a one-step generator capable of producing refined, clean outputs. While score distillation is traditionally viewed as a method to accelerate diffusion models, we show that it can also significantly enhance sample quality, particularly when starting from a degraded teacher model. Across varying noise levels and datasets, DSD consistently improves generative performancewe summarize our empirical evidence in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that, in a linear model setting, DSD identifies the eigenspace of the clean data distributions covariance matrix, implicitly regularizing the generator. This perspective reframes score distillation as not only a tool for efficiency but also a mechanism for improving generative models, particularly in low-quality data settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First Author and Second Author contributed equally to this work.

However, their slow generation speed remains a critical challenge. Existing acceleration methods, while aiming to reduce steps, often compromise sample quality, controllability, or introduce training complexities. Therefore, we propose RayFlow, a novel diffusion framework that addresses these limitations. Unlike previous methods, RayFlow guides each sample along a unique path towards an instance-specific target distribution. This method minimizes sampling steps while preserving generation diversity and stability. Furthermore, we introduce Time Sampler, an importance sampling technique to enhance training efficiency by focusing on crucial timesteps. Extensive experiments demonstrate RayFlow's superiority in generating high-quality images with improved speed, control, and training efficiency compared to existing acceleration techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[TriDi: Trilateral Diffusion of 3D Humans, Objects, and Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06334v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling 3D human-object interaction (HOI) is a problem of great interest for computer vision and a key enabler for virtual and mixed-reality applications. Existing methods work in a one-way direction: some recover plausible human interactions conditioned on a 3D object; others recover the object pose conditioned on a human pose. Instead, we provide the first unified model - TriDi which works in any direction. Concretely, we generate Human, Object, and Interaction modalities simultaneously with a new three-way diffusion process, allowing to model seven distributions with one network. We implement TriDi as a transformer attending to the various modalities' tokens, thereby discovering conditional relations between them. The user can control the interaction either as a text description of HOI or a contact map. We embed these two representations into a shared latent space, combining the practicality of text descriptions with the expressiveness of contact maps. Using a single network, TriDi unifies all the special cases of prior work and extends to new ones, modeling a family of seven distributions. Remarkably, despite using a single model, TriDi generated samples surpass one-way specialized baselines on GRAB and BEHAVE in terms of both qualitative and quantitative metrics, and demonstrating better diversity. We show the applicability of TriDi to scene population, generating objects for human-contact datasets, and generalization to unseen object geometry.

| **[DRESS: Diffusion Reasoning-based Reward Shaping Scheme For Intelligent Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07433v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network optimization remains fundamental in wireless communications, with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions gaining widespread adoption. As Sixth-Generation (6G) communication networks pursue full-scenario coverage, optimization in complex extreme environments presents unprecedented challenges. The dynamic nature of these environments, combined with physical constraints, makes it difficult for AI solutions such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to obtain effective reward feedback for the training process. However, many existing DRL-based network optimization studies overlook this challenge through idealized environment settings. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of Generative AI (GenAI), especially diffusion models, in capturing complex latent distributions, we introduce a novel Diffusion Reasoning-based Reward Shaping Scheme (DRESS) to achieve robust network optimization. By conditioning on observed environmental states and executed actions, DRESS leverages diffusion models' multi-step denoising process as a form of deep reasoning, progressively refining latent representations to generate meaningful auxiliary reward signals that capture patterns of network systems. Moreover, DRESS is designed for seamless integration with any DRL framework, allowing DRESS-aided DRL (DRESSed-DRL) to enable stable and efficient DRL training even under extreme network environments. Experimental results demonstrate that DRESSed-DRL achieves about 1.5x times faster convergence than its original version in sparse-reward wireless environments and significant performance improvements in multiple general DRL benchmark environments compared to baseline methods. The code of DRESS is available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/DRESS.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-Diffusion: Asynchronous Video Generation with Auto-Regressive Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07418v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of video generation requires synthesizing visually realistic and temporally coherent video frames. Existing methods primarily use asynchronous auto-regressive models or synchronous diffusion models to address this challenge. However, asynchronous auto-regressive models often suffer from inconsistencies between training and inference, leading to issues such as error accumulation, while synchronous diffusion models are limited by their reliance on rigid sequence length. To address these issues, we introduce Auto-Regressive Diffusion (AR-Diffusion), a novel model that combines the strengths of auto-regressive and diffusion models for flexible, asynchronous video generation. Specifically, our approach leverages diffusion to gradually corrupt video frames in both training and inference, reducing the discrepancy between these phases. Inspired by auto-regressive generation, we incorporate a non-decreasing constraint on the corruption timesteps of individual frames, ensuring that earlier frames remain clearer than subsequent ones. This setup, together with temporal causal attention, enables flexible generation of videos with varying lengths while preserving temporal coherence. In addition, we design two specialized timestep schedulers: the FoPP scheduler for balanced timestep sampling during training, and the AD scheduler for flexible timestep differences during inference, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves competitive and state-of-the-art results across four challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[TimeStep Master: Asymmetrical Mixture of Timestep LoRA Experts for Versatile and Efficient Diffusion Models in Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07416v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have driven the advancement of vision generation over the past years. However, it is often difficult to apply these large models in downstream tasks, due to massive fine-tuning cost. Recently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been applied for efficient tuning of diffusion models. Unfortunately, the capabilities of LoRA-tuned diffusion models are limited, since the same LoRA is used for different timesteps of the diffusion process. To tackle this problem, we introduce a general and concise TimeStep Master (TSM) paradigm with two key fine-tuning stages. In the fostering stage (1-stage), we apply different LoRAs to fine-tune the diffusion model at different timestep intervals. This results in different TimeStep LoRA experts that can effectively capture different noise levels. In the assembling stage (2-stage), we design a novel asymmetrical mixture of TimeStep LoRA experts, via core-context collaboration of experts at multi-scale intervals. For each timestep, we leverage TimeStep LoRA expert within the smallest interval as the core expert without gating, and use experts within the bigger intervals as the context experts with time-dependent gating. Consequently, our TSM can effectively model the noise level via the expert in the finest interval, and adaptively integrate contexts from the experts of other scales, boosting the versatility of diffusion models. To show the effectiveness of our TSM paradigm, we conduct extensive experiments on three typical and popular LoRA-related tasks of diffusion models, including domain adaptation, post-pretraining, and model distillation. Our TSM achieves the state-of-the-art results on all these tasks, throughout various model structures (UNet, DiT and MM-DiT) and visual data modalities (Image, Video), showing its remarkable generalization capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[SPEED: Scalable, Precise, and Efficient Concept Erasure for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07392v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Erasing concepts from large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has become increasingly crucial due to the growing concerns over copyright infringement, offensive content, and privacy violations. However, existing methods either require costly fine-tuning or degrade image quality for non-target concepts (i.e., prior) due to inherent optimization limitations. In this paper, we introduce SPEED, a model editing-based concept erasure approach that leverages null-space constraints for scalable, precise, and efficient erasure. Specifically, SPEED incorporates Influence-based Prior Filtering (IPF) to retain the most affected non-target concepts during erasing, Directed Prior Augmentation (DPA) to expand prior coverage while maintaining semantic consistency, and Invariant Equality Constraints (IEC) to regularize model editing by explicitly preserving key invariants during the T2I generation process. Extensive evaluations across multiple concept erasure tasks demonstrate that SPEED consistently outperforms existing methods in prior preservation while achieving efficient and high-fidelity concept erasure, successfully removing 100 concepts within just 5 seconds.

| **[TRCE: Towards Reliable Malicious Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07389v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable photorealistic image generation, but they also risk producing malicious content, such as NSFW images. To mitigate risk, concept erasure methods are studied to facilitate the model to unlearn specific concepts. However, current studies struggle to fully erase malicious concepts implicitly embedded in prompts (e.g., metaphorical expressions or adversarial prompts) while preserving the model's normal generation capability. To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE, using a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off between reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by erasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By identifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we optimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually similar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being overly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process. Following this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling trajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising prediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through contrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious content. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple malicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's original generation ability. The code is available at: http://github.com/ddgoodgood/TRCE. CAUTION: This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive material.</p></details> |  |

Existing works in this field aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn via memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for trustworthy application of GenAI. Existing works revealed that conditional DPMs are more prone to memorize training data than unconditional DPMs. And most data extraction methods developed so far target conditional DPMs. Although unconditional DPMs are less prone to data extraction, further investigation into these attacks remains essential since they serve as the foundation for conditional models like Stable Diffusion, and exploring these attacks will enhance our understanding of memorization in DPMs. In this work, we propose a novel data extraction method named \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a time-dependent classifier trained on generated data as surrogate conditions to extract training data from unconditional DPMs. Empirical results demonstrate that it can extract training data in challenging scenarios where previous methods fail, and it is, on average, over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical understanding of memorization in both conditional and unconditional DPMs and why SIDE is effective.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we introduce AttenST, a training-free attention-driven style transfer framework. Specifically, we propose a style-guided self-attention mechanism that conditions self-attention on the reference style by retaining the query of the content image while substituting its key and value with those from the style image, enabling effective style feature integration. To mitigate style information loss during inversion, we introduce a style-preserving inversion strategy that refines inversion accuracy through multiple resampling steps. Additionally, we propose a content-aware adaptive instance normalization, which integrates content statistics into the normalization process to optimize style fusion while mitigating the content degradation. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-feature cross-attention mechanism to fuse content and style features, ensuring a harmonious synthesis of structural fidelity and stylistic expression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AttenST outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in style transfer dataset.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reconstruction vs. Generation: Taming Optimization Dilemma in Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01423v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models with Transformer architectures excel at generating high-fidelity images. However, recent studies reveal an optimization dilemma in this two-stage design: while increasing the per-token feature dimension in visual tokenizers improves reconstruction quality, it requires substantially larger diffusion models and more training iterations to achieve comparable generation performance. Consequently, existing systems often settle for sub-optimal solutions, either producing visual artifacts due to information loss within tokenizers or failing to converge fully due to expensive computation costs. We argue that this dilemma stems from the inherent difficulty in learning unconstrained high-dimensional latent spaces. To address this, we propose aligning the latent space with pre-trained vision foundation models when training the visual tokenizers. Our proposed VA-VAE (Vision foundation model Aligned Variational AutoEncoder) significantly expands the reconstruction-generation frontier of latent diffusion models, enabling faster convergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) in high-dimensional latent spaces. To exploit the full potential of VA-VAE, we build an enhanced DiT baseline with improved training strategies and architecture designs, termed LightningDiT. The integrated system achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on ImageNet 256x256 generation with an FID score of 1.35 while demonstrating remarkable training efficiency by reaching an FID score of 2.11 in just 64 epochs--representing an over 21 times convergence speedup compared to the original DiT.

While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have driven progress in generic image and video synthesis, the domain of controllable VFX generation remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for animated VFX generation as image animation, where dynamic effects are generated from user-friendly textual descriptions and static reference images. Our work makes two primary contributions: (i) Open-VFX, the first high-quality VFX video dataset spanning 15 diverse effect categories, annotated with textual descriptions, instance segmentation masks for spatial conditioning, and start-end timestamps for temporal control. (ii) VFX Creator, a simple yet effective controllable VFX generation framework based on a Video Diffusion Transformer. The model incorporates a spatial and temporal controllable LoRA adapter, requiring minimal training videos. Specifically, a plug-and-play mask control module enables instance-level spatial manipulation, while tokenized start-end motion timestamps embedded in the diffusion process, alongside the text encoder, allow precise temporal control over effect timing and pace. Extensive experiments on the Open-VFX test set demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in generating realistic and dynamic effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance and generalization ability in both spatial and temporal controllability. Furthermore, we introduce a specialized metric to evaluate the precision of temporal control. By bridging traditional VFX techniques with generative approaches, VFX Creator unlocks new possibilities for efficient and high-quality video effect generation, making advanced VFX accessible to a broader audience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exposure Bias Reduction for Enhancing Diffusion Transformer Feature Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07120v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this problem, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing the impact of caching on the generation of intermediate processes. So the lack of exploration provides us with room for analysis and improvement. In this paper, we analyze the impact of caching on the SNR of the diffusion process and discern that feature caching intensifies the denoising procedure, and we further identify this as a more severe exposure bias issue. Drawing on this insight, we introduce EB-Cache, a joint cache strategy that aligns the Non-exposure bias (which gives us a higher performance ceiling) diffusion process. Our approach incorporates a comprehensive understanding of caching mechanisms and offers a novel perspective on leveraging caches to expedite diffusion processes. Empirical results indicate that EB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration. Specifically, in the 50-step generation process, EB-Cache achieves 1.49$\times$ acceleration with 0.63 FID reduction from 3.69, surpassing prior acceleration methods.

| **[Efficient Dataset Distillation via Diffusion-Driven Patch Selection for Improved Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09959v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation offers an efficient way to reduce memory and computational costs by optimizing a smaller dataset with performance comparable to the full-scale original. However, for large datasets and complex deep networks (e.g., ImageNet-1K with ResNet-101), the extensive optimization space limits performance, reducing its practicality. Recent approaches employ pre-trained diffusion models to generate informative images directly, avoiding pixel-level optimization and achieving notable results. However, these methods often face challenges due to distribution shifts between pre-trained models and target datasets, along with the need for multiple distillation steps across varying settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework orthogonal to existing diffusion-based distillation methods, leveraging diffusion models for selection rather than generation. Our method starts by predicting noise generated by the diffusion model based on input images and text prompts (with or without label text), then calculates the corresponding loss for each pair. With the loss differences, we identify distinctive regions of the original images. Additionally, we perform intra-class clustering and ranking on selected patches to maintain diversity constraints. This streamlined framework enables a single-step distillation process, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Language Model for Efficient Text Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10998v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at conditional generating high-quality images, prior works in discrete diffusion models were not evaluated on conditional long-text generation. In this work, we address the limitations of prior discrete diffusion models for conditional long-text generation, particularly in long sequence-to-sequence tasks such as abstractive summarization. Despite fast decoding speeds compared to autoregressive methods, previous diffusion models failed on the abstractive summarization task due to the incompatibility between the backbone architectures and the random noising process. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel semantic-aware noising process that enables Transformer backbones to handle long sequences effectively. Additionally, we propose CrossMamba, an adaptation of the Mamba model to the encoder-decoder paradigm, which integrates seamlessly with the random absorbing noising process. Our approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark summarization datasets: Gigaword, CNN/DailyMail, and Arxiv, outperforming existing discrete diffusion models on ROUGE metrics as well as possessing much faster speed in inference compared to autoregressive models.</p></details> |  |

Instead of proposing another specialized technique, we introduce a simple, unified framework to handle diverse conditional generation tasks involving a specific image-condition correlation. By learning a joint distribution over a correlated image pair (e.g. image and depth) with a diffusion model, our approach enables versatile capabilities via different inference-time sampling schemes, including controllable image generation (e.g. depth to image), estimation (e.g. image to depth), signal guidance, joint generation (image & depth), and coarse control. Previous attempts at unification often introduce significant complexity through multi-stage training, architectural modification, or increased parameter counts. In contrast, our simple formulation requires a single, computationally efficient training stage, maintains the standard model input, and adds minimal learned parameters (15% of the base model). Moreover, our model supports additional capabilities like non-spatially aligned and coarse conditioning. Extensive results show that our single model can produce comparable results with specialized methods and better results than prior unified methods. We also demonstrate that multiple models can be effectively combined for multi-signal conditional generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lixirui142.github.io/unicon-diffusion/</p></details> |
| **[Generative method for aerodynamic optimization based on classifier-free guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07056v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse design approach, which directly generates optimal aerodynamic shape with neural network models to meet designated performance targets, has drawn enormous attention. However, the current state-of-the-art inverse design approach for airfoils, which is based on generative adversarial network, demonstrates insufficient precision in its generating and training processes and struggles to reveal the coupling relationship among specified performance indicators. To address these issues, the airfoil inverse design framework based on the classifier-free guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (CDDPM) is proposed innovatively in this paper. First, the CDDPM can effectively capture the correlations among specific performance indicators and, by adjusting the classifier-free guide coefficient, generate corresponding upper and lower surface pressure coefficient distributions based on designated pressure features. These distributions are then accurately translated into airfoil geometries through a mapping model. Experimental results using classical transonic airfoils as examples show that the inverse design based on CDDPM can generate a variety of pressure coefficient distributions, which enriches the diversity of design results. Compared with current state-of-the-art Wasserstein generative adversarial network methods, CDDPM achieves a 33.6% precision improvement in airfoil generating tasks. Moreover, a practical method to readjust each performance indicator value is proposed based on global optimization algorithm in conjunction with active learning strategy, aiming to provide rational value combination of performance indicators for the inverse design framework. This work is not only suitable for the airfoils design, but also has the capability to apply to optimization process of general product parts targeting selected performance indicators.</p></details> | Under Review |

To bridge this gap, we introduce TIDE (Temporal-aware Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretable Diffusion transformErs), a novel framework that enhances temporal reconstruction within DiT activation layers across denoising steps. TIDE employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) with a sparse bottleneck layer to extract interpretable and hierarchical features, revealing that diffusion models inherently learn hierarchical features at multiple levels (e.g., 3D, semantic, class) during generative pre-training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 1e-3 and a cosine similarity of 0.97, demonstrating superior accuracy in capturing activation dynamics along the denoising trajectory. Beyond interpretability, we showcase TIDE's potential in downstream applications such as sparse activation-guided image editing and style transfer, enabling improved controllability for generative systems. By providing a comprehensive training and evaluation protocol tailored for DiTs, TIDE contributes to developing more interpretable, transparent, and trustworthy generative models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Timestep-Aware Diffusion Model for Extreme Image Rescaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09151v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image rescaling aims to learn the optimal low-resolution (LR) image that can be accurately reconstructed to its original high-resolution (HR) counterpart, providing an efficient image processing and storage method for ultra-high definition media. However, extreme downscaling factors pose significant challenges to the upscaling process due to its highly ill-posed nature, causing existing image rescaling methods to struggle in generating semantically correct structures and perceptual friendly textures. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Timestep-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM) for extreme image rescaling, which performs rescaling operations in the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder and effectively leverages powerful natural image priors learned by a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Specifically, TADM adopts a pseudo-invertible module to establish the bidirectional mapping between the latent features of the HR image and the target-sized LR image. Then, the rescaled latent features are enhanced by a pre-trained diffusion model to generate more faithful details. Considering the spatially non-uniform degradation caused by the rescaling operation, we propose a novel time-step alignment strategy, which can adaptively allocate the generative capacity of the diffusion model based on the quality of the reconstructed latent features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TADM over previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[EasyControl: Adding Efficient and Flexible Control for Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07027v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Unet-based diffusion models, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, have introduced effective spatial and subject control mechanisms. However, the DiT (Diffusion Transformer) architecture still struggles with efficient and flexible control. To tackle this issue, we propose EasyControl, a novel framework designed to unify condition-guided diffusion transformers with high efficiency and flexibility. Our framework is built on three key innovations. First, we introduce a lightweight Condition Injection LoRA Module. This module processes conditional signals in isolation, acting as a plug-and-play solution. It avoids modifying the base model weights, ensuring compatibility with customized models and enabling the flexible injection of diverse conditions. Notably, this module also supports harmonious and robust zero-shot multi-condition generalization, even when trained only on single-condition data. Second, we propose a Position-Aware Training Paradigm. This approach standardizes input conditions to fixed resolutions, allowing the generation of images with arbitrary aspect ratios and flexible resolutions. At the same time, it optimizes computational efficiency, making the framework more practical for real-world applications. Third, we develop a Causal Attention Mechanism combined with the KV Cache technique, adapted for conditional generation tasks. This innovation significantly reduces the latency of image synthesis, improving the overall efficiency of the framework.

| **[Erase Diffusion: Empowering Object Removal Through Calibrating Diffusion Pathways](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07026v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Erase inpainting, or object removal, aims to precisely remove target objects within masked regions while preserving the overall consistency of the surrounding content. Despite diffusion-based methods have made significant strides in the field of image inpainting, challenges remain regarding the emergence of unexpected objects or artifacts. We assert that the inexact diffusion pathways established by existing standard optimization paradigms constrain the efficacy of object removal. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Erase Diffusion, termed EraDiff, aimed at unleashing the potential power of standard diffusion in the context of object removal. In contrast to standard diffusion, the EraDiff adapts both the optimization paradigm and the network to improve the coherence and elimination of the erasure results. We first introduce a Chain-Rectifying Optimization (CRO) paradigm, a sophisticated diffusion process specifically designed to align with the objectives of erasure. This paradigm establishes innovative diffusion transition pathways that simulate the gradual elimination of objects during optimization, allowing the model to accurately capture the intent of object removal. Furthermore, to mitigate deviations caused by artifacts during the sampling pathways, we develop a simple yet effective Self-Rectifying Attention (SRA) mechanism. The SRA calibrates the sampling pathways by altering self-attention activation, allowing the model to effectively bypass artifacts while further enhancing the coherence of the generated content. With this design, our proposed EraDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages V5 dataset and demonstrates significant superiority in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

This is the first framework to apply classifier-free guided diffusion to quadruped locomotion and demonstrate its efficacy by extracting goal-conditioned behaviour from an originally unlabelled dataset. We show that these capabilities are compatible with a multi-skill policy and can be applied with little modification and minimal compute overhead, i.e., running entirely on the robots onboard CPU. We verify the validity of our approach with hardware experiments on the ANYmal quadruped platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOYO: A Tuning-Free Approach for Video Style Morphing via Style-Adaptive Interpolation in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06998v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in image and video stylization. However, most existing methods focus on single-style transfer, while video stylization involving multiple styles necessitates seamless transitions between them. We refer to this smooth style transition between video frames as video style morphing. Current approaches often generate stylized video frames with discontinuous structures and abrupt style changes when handling such transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SOYO, a novel diffusion-based framework for video style morphing. Our method employs a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model without fine-tuning, combining attention injection and AdaIN to preserve structural consistency and enable smooth style transitions across video frames. Moreover, we notice that applying linear equidistant interpolation directly induces imbalanced style morphing. To harmonize across video frames, we propose a novel adaptive sampling scheduler operating between two style images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOYO outperforms existing methods in open-domain video style morphing, better preserving the structural coherence of video frames while achieving stable and smooth style transitions.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLADIS: Pushing the Limits of Attention in Diffusion Models at Inference Time by Leveraging Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07677v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating high-quality conditional samples using guidance techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, existing methods often require additional training or neural function evaluations (NFEs), making them incompatible with guidance-distilled models. Also, they rely on heuristic approaches that need identifying target layers. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method, termed PLADIS, which boosts pre-trained models (U-Net/Transformer) by leveraging sparse attention. Specifically, we extrapolate query-key correlations using softmax and its sparse counterpart in the cross-attention layer during inference, without requiring extra training or NFEs. By leveraging the noise robustness of sparse attention, our PLADIS unleashes the latent potential of text-to-image diffusion models, enabling them to excel in areas where they once struggled with newfound effectiveness. It integrates seamlessly with guidance techniques, including guidance-distilled models. Extensive experiments show notable improvements in text alignment and human preference, offering a highly efficient and universally applicable solution.</p></details> | 29 pages, 19 figures |
| **[DiffSG: A Generative Solver for Network Optimization with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06701v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models, famous for their performance in image generation, are popular in various cross-domain applications. However, their use in the communication community has been mostly limited to auxiliary tasks like data modeling and feature extraction. These models hold greater promise for fundamental problems in network optimization compared to traditional machine learning methods. Discriminative deep learning often falls short due to its single-step input-output mapping and lack of global awareness of the solution space, especially given the complexity of network optimization's objective functions. In contrast, generative diffusion models can consider a broader range of solutions and exhibit stronger generalization by learning parameters that describe the distribution of the underlying solution space, with higher probabilities assigned to better solutions. We propose a new framework Diffusion Model-based Solution Generation (DiffSG), which leverages the intrinsic distribution learning capabilities of generative diffusion models to learn high-quality solution distributions based on given inputs. The optimal solution within this distribution is highly probable, allowing it to be effectively reached through repeated sampling. We validate the performance of DiffSG on several typical network optimization problems, including mixed-integer non-linear programming, convex optimization, and hierarchical non-convex optimization. Our results demonstrate that DiffSG outperforms existing baseline methods not only on in-domain inputs but also on out-of-domain inputs. In summary, we demonstrate the potential of generative diffusion models in tackling complex network optimization problems and outline a promising path for their broader application in the communication community.

SAR-to-EO (Electro-Optical) image translation (SET) has emerged to make SAR images more perceptually interpretable. However, traditional approaches trained from scratch on limited SAR-EO datasets are prone to overfitting. To address these challenges, we introduce Confidence Diffusion for SAR-to-EO Translation, called C-DiffSET, a framework leveraging pretrained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) extensively trained on natural images, thus enabling effective adaptation to the EO domain. Remarkably, we find that the pretrained VAE encoder aligns SAR and EO images in the same latent space, even with varying noise levels in SAR inputs. To further improve pixel-wise fidelity for SET, we propose a confidence-guided diffusion (C-Diff) loss that mitigates artifacts from temporal discrepancies, such as appearing or disappearing objects, thereby enhancing structural accuracy. C-DiffSET achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming the very recent image-to-image translation methods and SET methods with large margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page https://kaist-viclab.github.io/C-DiffSET_site/</p></details> |
| **[Post-Training Quantization for Diffusion Transformer via Hierarchical Timestep Grouping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06930v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has now become the preferred choice for building image generation models due to its great generation capability. Unlike previous convolution-based UNet models, DiT is purely composed of a stack of transformer blocks, which renders DiT excellent in scalability like large language models. However, the growing model size and multi-step sampling paradigm bring about considerable pressure on deployment and inference. In this work, we propose a post-training quantization framework tailored for Diffusion Transforms to tackle these challenges. We firstly locate that the quantization difficulty of DiT mainly originates from the time-dependent channel-specific outliers. We propose a timestep-aware shift-and-scale strategy to smooth the activation distribution to reduce the quantization error. Secondly, based on the observation that activations of adjacent timesteps have similar distributions, we utilize a hierarchical clustering scheme to divide the denoising timesteps into multiple groups. We further design a re-parameterization scheme which absorbs the quantization parameters into nearby module to avoid redundant computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that out PTQ method successfully quantize the Diffusion Transformer into 8-bit weight and 8-bit activation (W8A8) with state-of-the-art FiD score. And our method can further quantize DiT model into 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation (W4A8) without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Reusing to Forecasting: Accelerating Diffusion Models with TaylorSeers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06923v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

In zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, aligning skeleton features with the text features of action labels is essential for accurately predicting unseen actions. Previous methods focus on direct alignment between skeleton and text latent spaces, but the modality gaps between these spaces hinder robust generalization learning. Motivated from the remarkable performance of text-to-image diffusion models, we leverage their alignment capabilities between different modalities mostly by focusing on the training process during reverse diffusion rather than using their generative power. Based on this, our framework is designed as a Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM) method which aligns skeleton features with text prompts through reverse diffusion, embedding the prompts into the unified skeleton-text latent space to achieve robust matching. To enhance discriminative power, we introduce a novel triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to correct skeleton-text matches while pushing apart incorrect ones. Our TDSM significantly outperforms the very recent state-of-the-art methods with large margins of 2.36%-point to 13.05%-point, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability in zero-shot settings through effective skeleton-text matching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page at https://kaist-viclab.github.io/TDSM_site/</p></details> |
| **[Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Cannot Count, and Prompt Refinement Cannot Help](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06884v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling is widely regarded as one of the most essential problems in today's AI community, with text-to-image generation having gained unprecedented real-world impacts. Among various approaches, diffusion models have achieved remarkable success and have become the de facto solution for text-to-image generation. However, despite their impressive performance, these models exhibit fundamental limitations in adhering to numerical constraints in user instructions, frequently generating images with an incorrect number of objects. While several prior works have mentioned this issue, a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of this limitation remains lacking. To address this gap, we introduce T2ICountBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the counting ability of state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse set of generative models, including both open-source and private systems. It explicitly isolates counting performance from other capabilities, provides structured difficulty levels, and incorporates human evaluations to ensure high reliability. Extensive evaluations with T2ICountBench reveal that all state-of-the-art diffusion models fail to generate the correct number of objects, with accuracy dropping significantly as the number of objects increases. Additionally, an exploratory study on prompt refinement demonstrates that such simple interventions generally do not improve counting accuracy. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges in numerical understanding within diffusion models and point to promising directions for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[G2PDiffusion: Cross-Species Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction via Evolutionary Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04684v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how genes influence phenotype across species is a fundamental challenge in genetic engineering, which will facilitate advances in various fields such as crop breeding, conservation biology, and personalized medicine. However, current phenotype prediction models are limited to individual species and expensive phenotype labeling process, making the genotype-to-phenotype prediction a highly domain-dependent and data-scarce problem. To this end, we suggest taking images as morphological proxies, facilitating cross-species generalization through large-scale multimodal pretraining. We propose the first genotype-to-phenotype diffusion model (G2PDiffusion) that generates morphological images from DNA considering two critical evolutionary signals, i.e., multiple sequence alignments (MSA) and environmental contexts. The model contains three novel components: 1) a MSA retrieval engine that identifies conserved and co-evolutionary patterns; 2) an environment-aware MSA conditional encoder that effectively models complex genotype-environment interactions; and 3) an adaptive phenomic alignment module to improve genotype-phenotype consistency. Extensive experiments show that integrating evolutionary signals with environmental context enriches the model's understanding of phenotype variability across species, thereby offering a valuable and promising exploration into advanced AI-assisted genomic analysis.</p></details> |  |

For instance, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) can accurately identify eye diseases. However, traditional invasive FFA involves the injection of sodium fluorescein, which can cause discomfort and risks. Generating corresponding FFA images from non-invasive fundus images holds significant practical value but also presents challenges. First, limited datasets constrain the performance and effectiveness of models. Second, previous studies have primarily focused on generating FFA for single diseases or single modalities, often resulting in poor performance for patients with various ophthalmic conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel latent diffusion model-based framework, Diffusion, which introduces a fine-tuning protocol to overcome the challenge of limited medical data and unleash the generative capabilities of diffusion models. Furthermore, we designed a new approach to tackle the challenges of generating across different modalities and disease types. On limited datasets, our framework achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing methods, offering significant potential to enhance ophthalmic diagnostics and patient care.

Despite these advancements, three fundamental limitations persist, including 1) discrepancy between training and inference processes, 2) progressive information leakage throughout the noise corruption procedures, and 3) inherent constraints preventing effective integration of modern optimization criteria like perceptual and adversarial loss. To mitigate these critical challenges, we in this paper present a novel end-to-end learning paradigm that establishes direct optimization from the final generated samples to initial noises. Our proposed End-to-End Differentiable Diffusion, dubbed E2ED^2, introduces several key improvements: it eliminates the sequential training-sampling mismatch and intermediate information leakage via conceptualizing training as a direct transformation from isotropic Gaussian noise to the target data distribution. Additionally, such training framework enables seamless incorporation of adversarial and perceptual losses into the core optimization objective. Comprehensive evaluation across standard benchmarks including COCO30K and HW30K reveals that our method achieves substantial performance gains in terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP score, even with fewer sampling steps (less than 4). Our findings highlight that the end-to-end mechanism might pave the way for more robust and efficient solutions, \emph{i.e.,} combining diffusion stability with GAN-like discriminative optimization in an end-to-end manner.</p></details> | Technical report |

Our proposed framework, termed the "World-Centric Diffusion Transformer"(WcDT), optimizes the entire trajectory generation process, from feature extraction to model inference. To enhance the scene diversity and stochasticity, the historical trajectory data is first preprocessed into "Agent Move Statement" and encoded into latent space using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) enhanced with Diffusion with Transformer (DiT) blocks. Then, the latent features, historical trajectories, HD map features, and historical traffic signal information are fused with various transformer-based encoders that are used to enhance the interaction of agents with other elements in the traffic scene. The encoded traffic scenes are then decoded by a trajectory decoder to generate multimodal future trajectories. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed approach exhibits superior performance in generating both realistic and diverse trajectories, showing its potential for integration into automatic driving simulation systems.

Such an MRT-LB model considers the transformation matrix constructed in a natural way and the DdQ(2d^2+1) lattice structure. A key step in developing the high-order MRT-LB model is to determine the adjustable relaxation parameters and weight coefficients, which are used to eliminate the truncation errors at certain orders of the MRT-LB model, while ensuring the stability of the MRT-LB model. In this work, we first present a unified MRT-LB model for the diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equation. Then, through the direct Taylor expansion, we analyze the macroscopic modified equations of the MRT-LB model up to fourth-order, and further derive the fourth-order consistent conditions of the MRT-LB model. Additionally, we also construct the fourth-order initialization scheme for the present LB method. After that, the condition which guarantees that the MRT-LB model can satisfy the stability structure is explicitly given, and from a numerical perspective, once the stability structure is satisfied, the MRT-LB model must be L^2 stable. In combination with the fourth-order consistent and L^2 stability conditions, the relaxation parameters and weight coefficients of the MRT-LB model can be automatically given by a simple computer code. Finally, we perform numerical simulations of several benchmark problems, and find that the numerical results can achieve a fourth-order convergence rate, which is in agreement with our theoretical analysis. In particular, for the isotropic diffusion equation, we also make a comparison between the fourth-order MRT-LB models with the DdQ(2d^2+1) and DdQ(2d+1) lattice structures, and the numerical results show that the MRT-LB model with the DdQ(2d^2+1) lattice structure is more general.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-step Diffusion Models with $f$-Divergence Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15681v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from diffusion models involves a slow iterative process that hinders their practical deployment, especially for interactive applications. To accelerate generation speed, recent approaches distill a multi-step diffusion model into a single-step student generator via variational score distillation, which matches the distribution of samples generated by the student to the teacher's distribution. However, these approaches use the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for distribution matching which is known to be mode seeking. In this paper, we generalize the distribution matching approach using a novel $f$-divergence minimization framework, termed $f$-distill, that covers different divergences with different trade-offs in terms of mode coverage and training variance. We derive the gradient of the $f$-divergence between the teacher and student distributions and show that it is expressed as the product of their score differences and a weighting function determined by their density ratio. This weighting function naturally emphasizes samples with higher density in the teacher distribution, when using a less mode-seeking divergence. We observe that the popular variational score distillation approach using the reverse-KL divergence is a special case within our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that alternative $f$-divergences, such as forward-KL and Jensen-Shannon divergences, outperform the current best variational score distillation methods across image generation tasks. In particular, when using Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-distill achieves current state-of-the-art one-step generation performance on ImageNet64 and zero-shot text-to-image generation on MS-COCO.

Off-the-shelf generative models, trained on Internet-scale data but not on specialized underwater images, exhibit downgraded realism, as images of the seafloor are relatively uncommon. To this end, we introduce DreamSea, a generative model to generate hyper-realistic underwater scenes. DreamSea is trained on real-world image databases collected from underwater robot surveys. Images from these surveys contain massive real seafloor observations and covering large areas, but are prone to noise and artifacts from the real world. We extract 3D geometry and semantics from the data with visual foundation models, and train a diffusion model that generates realistic seafloor images in RGBD channels, conditioned on novel fractal distribution-based latent embeddings. We then fuse the generated images into a 3D map, building a 3DGS model supervised by 2D diffusion priors which allows photorealistic novel view rendering. DreamSea is rigorously evaluated, demonstrating the ability to robustly generate large-scale underwater scenes that are consistent, diverse, and photorealistic. Our work drives impact in multiple domains, spanning filming, gaming, and robot simulation.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Deep learning models like U-Net have shown great success but depend heavily on large datasets and struggle with domain shifts, complex structures, and limited training samples. Recent studies have explored diffusion models for segmentation by iteratively refining masks. However, these methods still retain the conventional image-to-mask mapping, making them highly sensitive to input data, which hampers stability and generalization. In contrast, we introduce DiffAtlas, a novel generative framework that models both images and masks through diffusion during training, effectively ``GenAI-fying'' atlas-based segmentation. During testing, the model is guided to generate a specific target image-mask pair, from which the corresponding mask is obtained. DiffAtlas retains the robustness of the atlas paradigm while overcoming its scalability and domain-specific limitations. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI across same-domain, cross-modality, varying-domain, and different data-scale settings using the MMWHS and TotalSegmentator datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in limited-data and zero-shot modality segmentation.
