| **[Scaling RL to Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.0% and 70.7% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-R1 across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1 shows steady performance improvements as the number of input video frames increases. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at https://github.com/NVlabs/Long-RL and model at https://huggingface.co/Efficient-Large-Model/LongVILA-R1-7B</p></details> |
| **[Iwin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Interleaved Windows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18405v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens, enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are available at https://github.com/cominder/Iwin-Transformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[ToonifyGB: StyleGAN-based Gaussian Blendshapes for 3D Stylized Head Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10072v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of 3D Gaussian blendshapes has enabled the real-time reconstruction of animatable head avatars from monocular video. Toonify, a StyleGAN-based method, has become widely used for facial image stylization. To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB. In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we adopt an improved StyleGAN to generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which overcomes the limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable stylized video, which enables Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video frames, facilitating the synthesis of high-quality animations in the next stage. In Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), our method learns a stylized neutral head model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated stylized video. By combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the effectiveness of ToonifyGB on benchmark datasets using two representative styles: Arcane and Pixar.</p></details> |  |
| **[T2VWorldBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating World Knowledge in Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18107v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60 subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available, ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for commonsense reasoning and factual generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[History-Guided Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06764v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a key technique for improving conditional generation in diffusion models, enabling more accurate control while enhancing sample quality. It is natural to extend this technique to video diffusion, which generates video conditioned on a variable number of context frames, collectively referred to as history. However, we find two key challenges to guiding with variable-length history: architectures that only support fixed-size conditioning, and the empirical observation that CFG-style history dropout performs poorly. To address this, we propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), a video diffusion architecture and theoretically grounded training objective that jointly enable conditioning on a flexible number of history frames. We then introduce History Guidance, a family of guidance methods uniquely enabled by DFoT. We show that its simplest form, vanilla history guidance, already significantly improves video generation quality and temporal consistency. A more advanced method, history guidance across time and frequency further enhances motion dynamics, enables compositional generalization to out-of-distribution history, and can stably roll out extremely long videos.

| **[Enhancing Scene Transition Awareness in Video Generation via Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18046v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on \emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting transitions. To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV) dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV} dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Celeb-DF++: A Large-scale Challenging Video DeepFake Benchmark for Generalizable Forensics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18015v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity. However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment (FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/OUC-VAS/Celeb-DF-PP</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Dynamic Concept Personalization with Grid-Based LoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17963v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning, limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs, enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and editing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page and Video : https://snap-research.github.io/zero-shot-dynamic-concepts/</p></details> |
| **[Bob's Confetti: Phonetic Memorization Attacks in Music and Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17937v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright, safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).</p></details> |  |
| **[Yume: An Interactive World Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17744v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Yume aims to use images, text, or videos to create an interactive, realistic, and dynamic world, which allows exploration and control using peripheral devices or neural signals. In this report, we present a preview version of \method, which creates a dynamic world from an input image and allows exploration of the world using keyboard actions. To achieve this high-fidelity and interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework, which consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization, video generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First, we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion Transformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM) and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE) are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the high-quality world exploration dataset \sekai to train \method, and it achieves remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and model weights are available on https://github.com/stdstu12/YUME. Yume will update monthly to achieve its original goal.

| **[Towards Generalist Robot Learning from Internet Video: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19664v5)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling deep learning to massive and diverse internet data has driven remarkable breakthroughs in domains such as video generation and natural language processing. Robot learning, however, has thus far failed to replicate this success and remains constrained by a scarcity of available data. Learning from videos (LfV) methods aim to address this data bottleneck by augmenting traditional robot data with large-scale internet video. This video data provides foundational information regarding physical dynamics, behaviours, and tasks, and can be highly informative for general-purpose robots. This survey systematically examines the emerging field of LfV. We first outline essential concepts, including detailing fundamental LfV challenges such as distribution shift and missing action labels in video data. Next, we comprehensively review current methods for extracting knowledge from large-scale internet video, overcoming LfV challenges, and improving robot learning through video-informed training. The survey concludes with a critical discussion of future opportunities. Here, we emphasize the need for scalable foundation model approaches that can leverage the full range of available internet video and enhance the learning of robot policies and dynamics models. Overall, the survey aims to inform and catalyse future LfV research, driving progress towards general-purpose robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[EndoGen: Conditional Autoregressive Endoscopic Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17388v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endoscopic video generation is crucial for advancing medical imaging and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. However, prior efforts in this field have either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation.

| **[Qffusion: Controllable Portrait Video Editing via Quadrant-Grid Attention Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06438v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Qffusion, a dual-frame-guided framework for portrait video editing. Specifically, we consider a design principle of ``animation for editing'', and train Qffusion as a general animation framework from two still reference images while we can use it for portrait video editing easily by applying modified start and end frames as references during inference. Leveraging the powerful generative power of Stable Diffusion, we propose a Quadrant-grid Arrangement (QGA) scheme for latent re-arrangement, which arranges the latent codes of two reference images and that of four facial conditions into a four-grid fashion, separately. Then, we fuse features of these two modalities and use self-attention for both appearance and temporal learning, where representations at different times are jointly modeled under QGA. Our Qffusion can achieve stable video editing without additional networks or complex training stages, where only the input format of Stable Diffusion is modified. Further, we propose a Quadrant-grid Propagation (QGP) inference strategy, which enjoys a unique advantage on stable arbitrary-length video generation by processing reference and condition frames recursively. Through extensive experiments, Qffusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on portrait video editing. Project page: https://qffusion.github.io/page/.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Human-Activity AGV Quality Assessment: A Benchmark Dataset and an Objective Evaluation Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16619v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven video generation techniques have made significant progress in recent years. However, AI-generated videos (AGVs) involving human activities often exhibit substantial visual and semantic distortions, hindering the practical application of video generation technologies in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we conduct a pioneering study on human activity AGV quality assessment, focusing on visual quality evaluation and the identification of semantic distortions. First, we construct the AI-Generated Human activity Video Quality Assessment (Human-AGVQA) dataset, consisting of 6,000 AGVs derived from 15 popular text-to-video (T2V) models using 400 text prompts that describe diverse human activities. We conduct a subjective study to evaluate the human appearance quality, action continuity quality, and overall video quality of AGVs, and identify semantic issues of human body parts. Based on Human-AGVQA, we benchmark the performance of T2V models and analyze their strengths and weaknesses in generating different categories of human activities. Second, we develop an objective evaluation metric, named AI-Generated Human activity Video Quality metric (GHVQ), to automatically analyze the quality of human activity AGVs. GHVQ systematically extracts human-focused quality features, AI-generated content-aware quality features, and temporal continuity features, making it a comprehensive and explainable quality metric for human activity AGVs. The extensive experimental results show that GHVQ outperforms existing quality metrics on the Human-AGVQA dataset by a large margin, demonstrating its efficacy in assessing the quality of human activity AGVs. The Human-AGVQA dataset and GHVQ metric will be released at https://github.com/zczhang-sjtu/GHVQ.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |
| **[MotionShot: Adaptive Motion Transfer across Arbitrary Objects for Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16310v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a reference object to a target object with significant differences in appearance or structure between them. To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot, a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments.

| **[Controllable Video Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16869v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular, the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex, multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models, analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

| **[PUSA V1.0: Surpassing Wan-I2V with $500 Training Cost by Vectorized Timestep Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16116v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep variables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work, we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency -- surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training cost (\$500 vs. $\geq$ \$100,000) and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs. $\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V) generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training. Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable, efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis, democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

Benchmarking Physical Commonsense Understanding in Video Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15824v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation has enabled the synthesis of visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language. However, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing outputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior, and tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use, material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical plausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse state-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1) formulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated video with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer several physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect strategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based evaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas overlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured, interpretable framework for assessing physical commonsense in generative video models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TokensGen: Harnessing Condensed Tokens for Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15728v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips, extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To (Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference, an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips, reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive simulations.

| **[Conditional Video Generation for High-Efficiency Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15269v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free-Form Motion Control: Controlling the 6D Poses of Camera and Objects in Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01425v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling the movements of dynamic objects and the camera within generated videos is a meaningful yet challenging task. Due to the lack of datasets with comprehensive 6D pose annotations, existing text-to-video methods can not simultaneously control the motions of both camera and objects in 3D-aware manner, resulting in limited controllability over generated contents. To address this issue and facilitate the research in this field, we introduce a Synthetic Dataset for Free-Form Motion Control (SynFMC). The proposed SynFMC dataset includes diverse object and environment categories and covers various motion patterns according to specific rules, simulating common and complex real-world scenarios. The complete 6D pose information facilitates models learning to disentangle the motion effects from objects and the camera in a video.~To provide precise 3D-aware motion control, we further propose a method trained on SynFMC, Free-Form Motion Control (FMC). FMC can control the 6D poses of objects and camera independently or simultaneously, producing high-fidelity videos. Moreover, it is compatible with various personalized text-to-image (T2I) models for different content styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMC outperforms previous methods across multiple scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project Page: https://henghuiding.github.io/SynFMC/</p></details> |
| **[DualReal: Adaptive Joint Training for Lossless Identity-Motion Fusion in Video Customization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02192v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customized text-to-video generation with pre-trained large-scale models has recently garnered significant attention by focusing on identity and motion consistency. Existing works typically follow the isolated customized paradigm, where the subject identity or motion dynamics are customized exclusively. However, this paradigm completely ignores the intrinsic mutual constraints and synergistic interdependencies between identity and motion, resulting in identity-motion conflicts throughout the generation process that systematically degrade. To address this, we introduce DualReal, a novel framework that employs adaptive joint training to construct interdependencies between dimensions collaboratively. Specifically, DualReal is composed of two units: (1) Dual-aware Adaptation dynamically switches the training step (i.e., identity or motion), learns the current information guided by the frozen dimension prior, and employs a regularization strategy to avoid knowledge leakage; (2) StageBlender Controller leverages the denoising stages and Diffusion Transformer depths to guide different dimensions with adaptive granularity, avoiding conflicts at various stages and ultimately achieving lossless fusion of identity and motion patterns. We constructed a more comprehensive evaluation benchmark than existing methods.

Most recent studies have focused on reconstructing static images from EEG recordings. In this work, we propose a framework to reconstruct dynamic visual stimuli from EEG data and conduct an in-depth study of the information encoded in EEG signals. Our approach first trains a feature extraction network using a triplet-based contrastive learning strategy within an EEG-video generation framework. The extracted EEG features are then used for video synthesis with a modified StyleGAN-ADA, which incorporates temporal information as conditioning. Additionally, we analyze how different brain regions contribute to processing dynamic visual stimuli. Through several empirical studies, we evaluate the effectiveness of our framework and investigate how much dynamic visual information can be inferred from EEG signals. The inferences we derive through our extensive studies would be of immense value to future research on extracting visual dynamics from EEG.</p></details> |  |

In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Our model provides precise control over weather effect intensity and supports blending various weather types, ensuring both realism and adaptability. To overcome the scarcity of paired training data, we propose a novel data strategy combining synthetic videos, generative image editing, and auto-labeled real-world videos.

However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage available at https://simplegvr.github.io/</p></details> |

However, a key challenge remains: precise and flexible camera pose control, which is crucial for accurate viewpoint transformation and realistic simulation of scene dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PosePilot, a lightweight yet powerful framework that significantly enhances camera pose controllability in generative world models. Drawing inspiration from self-supervised depth estimation, PosePilot leverages structure-from-motion principles to establish a tight coupling between camera pose and video generation. Specifically, we incorporate self-supervised depth and pose readouts, allowing the model to infer depth and relative camera motion directly from video sequences. These outputs drive pose-aware frame warping, guided by a photometric warping loss that enforces geometric consistency across synthesized frames. To further refine camera pose estimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss, improving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot significantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both diffusion-based and auto-regressive world models. By steering camera pose with self-supervised depth, PosePilot sets a new benchmark for pose controllability, enabling physically consistent, reliable viewpoint synthesis in generative world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/RSJ IROS 2025</p></details> |

However, the quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs). By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold, NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score, human evaluation score) and visual quality drop.

In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number of inference steps to four.

However, their ability to accurately simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency. Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050 curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world physics.

| **[Leveraging Pre-Trained Visual Models for AI-Generated Video Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13224v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation, ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes, creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training, and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness. Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models, and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.</p></details> |  |

We introduce LoViC, a DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot generation within a unified paradigm.

However, this objective is limited by two fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators, effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise. Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://amap-ml.github.io/NarrLV-Website/</p></details> |

While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur, temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization. Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy. Meanwhile, a motion consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS inference speed.

This task presents challenges due to the significant one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image, predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while generalizing across speakers and contexts.

One particularly challenging case is the class of videos in which the intricate motion of the hand coupled with a mostly stable and otherwise distracting environment is necessary to convey the execution of some complex action and its effects. To address these challenges, we introduce a new method for video generation that focuses on hand-centric actions. Our diffusion-based method incorporates two distinct innovations. First, we propose an automatic method to generate the motion area -- the region in the video in which the detailed activities occur -- guided by both the visual context and the action text prompt, rather than assuming this region can be provided manually as is now commonplace. Second, we introduce a critical Hand Refinement Loss to guide the diffusion model to focus on smooth and consistent hand poses. We evaluate our method on challenging augmented datasets based on EpicKitchens and Ego4D, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of action clarity, especially of the hand motion in the target region, across diverse environments and actions.

However, they also introduce significant usability challenges, as users often struggle to provide precise camera parameters when working with arbitrary real-world images without knowledge of their depth nor scene scale. To address these real-world application issues, we propose RealCam-I2V, a novel diffusion-based video generation framework that integrates monocular metric depth estimation to establish 3D scene reconstruction in a preprocessing step. During training, the reconstructed 3D scene enables scaling camera parameters from relative to metric scales, ensuring compatibility and scale consistency across diverse real-world images. In inference, RealCam-I2V offers an intuitive interface where users can precisely draw camera trajectories by dragging within the 3D scene. To further enhance precise camera control and scene consistency, we propose scene-constrained noise shaping, which shapes high-level noise and also allows the framework to maintain dynamic and coherent video generation in lower noise stages. RealCam-I2V achieves significant improvements in controllability and video quality on the RealEstate10K and out-of-domain images.

The core of these capabilities lies in powerful pre-trained foundation models, trained on large-scale, high-quality datasets. However, many advanced methods rely on in-house data subject to various constraints, and other current studies fail to generate high-resolution face videos, which is mainly attributed to the significant lack of large-scale, high-quality face video datasets. In this paper, we introduce a human face video dataset, \textbf{DH-FaceVid-1K}. Our collection spans 1,200 hours in total, encompassing 270,043 video clips from over 20,000 individuals.

We establish multiple face video generation models supporting tasks such as text-to-video and image-to-video generation. In addition, we develop comprehensive benchmarks to validate the scaling law when using different proportions of proposed dataset.

Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines.

While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose $I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that $I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

| **[Taming generative video models for zero-shot optical flow extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09082v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem. Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm, which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture. Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://neuroailab.github.io/projects/kl_tracing</p></details> |
| **[Lumos-1: On Autoregressive Video Generation from a Unified Model Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08801v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality. Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

As its core, we introduce a unified transformer-diffusion framework, featuring an autoregressive transformer model that synthesize extended and music-synchronized token sequences for 2D body, head and hands poses, which then guide a diffusion model to produce coherent and realistic dance video frames. Unlike traditional methods that primarily generate human motion in 3D, X-Dancer addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by modeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, capturing their nuanced alignment with musical beats through readily available monocular videos. To achieve this, we first build a spatially compositional token representation from 2D human pose labels associated with keypoint confidences, encoding both large articulated body movements (e.g., upper and lower body) and fine-grained motions (e.g., head and hands). We then design a music-to-motion transformer model that autoregressively generates music-aligned dance pose token sequences, incorporating global attention to both musical style and prior motion context. Finally we leverage a diffusion backbone to animate the reference image with these synthesized pose tokens through AdaIN, forming a fully differentiable end-to-end framework. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Dancer is able to produce both diverse and characterized dance videos, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods in term of diversity, expressiveness and realism. Code and model will be available for research purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025. Project Page: https://zeyuan-chen.com/X-Dancer/</p></details> |

| **[Upsample What Matters: Region-Adaptive Latent Sampling for Accelerated Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08422v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods.

However, this task poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data, synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally, camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://marsgenai.github.io</p></details> |

Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining.

Similar results have previously been achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://v-mem.github.io</p></details> |

Furthermore, videos exceeding 16 seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their architectural designs and performance characteristics.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their popularity, these models rely on user-provided text and image prompts, and there is currently no dedicated dataset for studying these prompts. In this paper, we introduce TIP-I2V, the first large-scale dataset of over 1.70 million unique user-provided Text and Image Prompts specifically for Image-to-Video generation. Additionally, we provide the corresponding generated videos from five state-of-the-art image-to-video models. We begin by outlining the time-consuming and costly process of curating this large-scale dataset. Next, we compare TIP-I2V to two popular prompt datasets, VidProM (text-to-video) and DiffusionDB (text-to-image), highlighting differences in both basic and semantic information. This dataset enables advancements in image-to-video research. For instance, to develop better models, researchers can use the prompts in TIP-I2V to analyze user preferences and evaluate the multi-dimensional performance of their trained models; and to enhance model safety, they may focus on addressing the misinformation issue caused by image-to-video models. The new research inspired by TIP-I2V and the differences with existing datasets emphasize the importance of a specialized image-to-video prompt dataset.

Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore, automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation. Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color consistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

| **[Physics-Grounded Motion Forecasting via Equation Discovery for Trajectory-Guided Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06830v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions, our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, project page: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/OmniVideo_project/</p></details> |
| **[PromptTea: Let Prompts Tell TeaCache the Optimal Threshold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06739v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues, PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example, 2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across a range of scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, altering camera trajectories of a given video remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation. It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories. The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video conditioning mechanism--its capability is often overlooked in current research. To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5, which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics, covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Stabilized and Efficient Diffusion Transformers through Long-Skip-Connections with Spectral Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17616v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high fidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish Long-Skip-Connections as critical architectural components for stable and efficient diffusion transformers.

Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios, providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further research in medical video generation. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/MedGen</p></details> |  |

Synthesizing sustained footage (e.g. over minutes) still remains an open research question. In this paper, we propose MALT Diffusion (using Memory-Augmented Latent Transformers), a new diffusion model specialized for long video generation. MALT Diffusion (or just MALT) handles long videos by subdividing them into short segments and doing segment-level autoregressive generation. To achieve this, we first propose recurrent attention layers that encode multiple segments into a compact memory latent vector; by maintaining this memory vector over time, MALT is able to condition on it and continuously generate new footage based on a long temporal context. We also present several training techniques that enable the model to generate frames over a long horizon with consistent quality and minimal degradation. We validate the effectiveness of MALT through experiments on long video benchmarks. We first perform extensive analysis of MALT in long-contextual understanding capability and stability using popular long video benchmarks. For example, MALT achieves an FVD score of 220.4 on 128-frame video generation on UCF-101, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of 648.4. Finally, we explore MALT's capabilities in a text-to-video generation setting and show that it can produce long videos compared with recent techniques for long text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop on AI for Content Creation (Oral)</p></details> |

However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in our project website: https://cumulo-autumn.github.io/StreamDiT/</p></details> |  |

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |

However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that generates both audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. By using a unified denoising network, UniForm captures the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Additionally, we propose task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling the model to support multiple tasks with a single set of parameters, including video-to-audio, audio-to-video and text-to-audio-video generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Experiments show that UniForm achieves performance close to the state-of-the-art single-task models across three generation tasks, with generated content that is not only highly aligned with real-world data distributions but also enables more diverse and fine-grained generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our demos are available at https://uniform-t2av.github.io/</p></details> |

However, existing methods often generate only a single dominant color, missing emotion variation. Others rely on indirect mappings through text or images, resulting in the loss of crucial emotion details. To address these challenges, we present Music2Palette, a novel method for emotion-aligned color palette generation via cross-modal representation learning. We first construct MuCED, a dataset of 2,634 expert-validated music-palette pairs aligned through Russell-based emotion vectors. To directly translate music into palettes, we propose a cross-modal representation learning framework with a music encoder and color decoder. We further propose a multi-objective optimization approach that jointly enhances emotion alignment, color diversity, and palette coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current methods in interpreting music emotion and generating attractive and diverse color palettes. Our approach enables applications like music-driven image recoloring, video generating, and data visualization, bridging the gap between auditory and visual emotion experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation Guided by Simple yet Effective Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04705v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.</p></details> |  |

We address these issues to enhance the consistency and coherence of videos generated with either single or multiple prompts. We propose the Time-frequency based temporal Attention Reweighting Algorithm (TiARA), which judiciously edits the attention score matrix based on the Discrete Short-Time Fourier Transform. This method is supported by a frequency-based analysis, ensuring that the edited attention score matrix achieves improved consistency across frames. It represents the first-of-its-kind for frequency-based methods in video diffusion models. For videos generated by multiple prompts, we further uncover key factors such as the alignment of the prompts affecting prompt interpolation quality. Inspired by our analyses, we propose PromptBlend, an advanced prompt interpolation pipeline that systematically aligns the prompts. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating consistent and substantial improvements over multiple baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Building Physically Plausible World Models (Best Paper), 32 pages, 17 figures</p></details> |

However, generating temporally coherent and visually realistic videos remains a significant challenge due to the high dimensionality and complex dynamics of video data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep generative network architecture designed specifically for high-resolution video synthesis. Our approach integrates key concepts from Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs), enforcing a k-Lipschitz continuity constraint on the discriminator to stabilize training and enhance convergence. We further leverage Conditional GAN (cGAN) techniques by incorporating class labels during both training and inference, enabling class-specific video generation with improved semantic consistency. We provide a detailed layer-wise description of the Generator and Discriminator networks, highlighting architectural design choices promoting temporal coherence and spatial detail. The overall combined architecture, training algorithm, and optimization strategy are thoroughly presented. Our training objective combines a pixel-wise mean squared error loss with an adversarial loss to balance frame-level accuracy and video realism. We validate our approach on benchmark datasets including UCF101, Golf, and Aeroplane, encompassing diverse motion patterns and scene contexts. Quantitative evaluations using Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art unsupervised video generation methods in terms of both quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |

Processing these videos generates valuable assets for training sophisticated models. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-RL, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training model tailored for semantic segmentation for surgical scenes. CLIP-RL presents a new segmentation approach which involves reinforcement learning and curriculum learning, enabling continuous refinement of the segmentation masks during the full training pipeline. Our model has shown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions, texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges. CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic context that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL module plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through iterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018 and EndoVis 2017 datasets. CLIP-RL achieved a mean IoU of 81%, outperforming state-of-the-art models, and a mean IoU of 74.12% on EndoVis 2017. This superior performance was achieved due to the combination of contrastive learning with reinforcement learning and curriculum learning.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches are limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames, generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible presentation formats.

However, the slow inference speed and high computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this, we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient, high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating videos in a wide range of scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nextframed.github.io/</p></details> |

As a result, there are also growing concerns about the potential misuse of video generation for spreading illegal content and misinformation. In this work, we introduce VGMShield: a set of straightforward but effective mitigations through the lifecycle of fake video generation. We start from fake video detection, trying to understand whether there is uniqueness in generated videos and whether we can differentiate them from real videos; then, we investigate the fake video source tracing problem, which maps a fake video back to the model that generated it. Towards these, we propose to leverage pre-trained models that focus on spatial-temporal dynamics as the backbone to identify inconsistencies in videos. In detail, we analyze fake videos from the perspective of the generation process. Based on the observation of attention shifts, motion variations, and frequency fluctuations, we identify common patterns in the generated video. These patterns serve as the foundation for our experiments on fake video detection and source tracing. Through experiments on seven state-of-the-art open-source models, we demonstrate that current models still cannot reliably reproduce spatial-temporal relationships, and thus, we can accomplish detection and source tracing with over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, anticipating future generative model improvements, we propose a prevention method that adds invisible perturbations to the query images to make the generated videos look unreal. Together with detection and tracing, our multi-faceted set of solutions can effectively mitigate misuse of video generative models.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600, UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters, across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content. Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video generation.

In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</p></details> |  |

We innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD), which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos. Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art VQA models on our database.

| **[Self-Guidance: Boosting Flow and Diffusion Generation on Their Own](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05827v4)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proper guidance strategies are essential to achieve high-quality generation results without retraining diffusion and flow-based text-to-image models. Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, potentially limiting their applications. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which improves the image quality by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. SG only relies on the sampling probabilities of its own diffusion model at different noise levels with no need of any guidance-specific training. This makes it flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms. We also introduce a more efficient approximation of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid doubling sampling time. We conduct experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG with only one forward pass. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability of eliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We will release our code along with this paper.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Models for Language Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07050v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution, followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation. Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed. Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of 4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting future work in non-autoregressive language generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>pdfLa...</summary><p>pdfLaTeX, 69 pages with 21 figures, Licentiate Thesis</p></details> |

Concat-ID employs variational autoencoders to extract image features, which are then concatenated with video latents along the sequence dimension. It relies exclusively on inherent 3D self-attention mechanisms to incorporate them, eliminating the need for additional parameters or modules. A novel cross-video pairing strategy and a multi-stage training regimen are introduced to balance identity consistency and facial editability while enhancing video naturalness. Extensive experiments demonstrate Concat-ID's superiority over existing methods in both single and multi-identity generation, as well as its seamless scalability to multi-subject scenarios, including virtual try-on and background-controllable generation. Concat-ID establishes a new benchmark for identity-preserving video synthesis, providing a versatile and scalable solution for a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamCinema: Cinematic Transfer with Free Camera and 3D Character](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12601v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are living in a flourishing era of digital media, where everyone has the potential to become a personal filmmaker. Current research on video generation suggests a promising avenue for controllable film creation in pixel space using Diffusion models. However, the reliance on overly verbose prompts and insufficient focus on cinematic elements (e.g., camera movement) results in videos that lack cinematic quality. Furthermore, the absence of 3D modeling often leads to failures in video generation, such as inconsistent character models at different frames, ultimately hindering the immersive experience for viewers. In this paper, we propose a new framework for film creation, Dream-Cinema, which is designed for user-friendly, 3D space-based film creation with generative models. Specifically, we decompose 3D film creation into four key elements: 3D character, driven motion, camera movement, and environment. We extract the latter three elements from user-specified film shots and generate the 3D character using a generative model based on a provided image. To seamlessly recombine these elements and ensure smooth film creation, we propose structure-guided character animation, shape-aware camera movement optimization, and environment-aware generative refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating high-quality films with free camera and 3D characters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://liuff19.github.io/DreamCinema</p></details> |

Among them, Stable Diffusion (StableDiff) stands out as a key model for text-to-image generation and a foundation for next-generation multi-modal algorithms. However, its high computational and memory demands hinder inference speed and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we identify three core issues: (1) intensive and often redundant computations, (2) heterogeneous operations involving convolutions and attention mechanisms, and (3) diverse weight and activation sizes. We present SD-Acc, a novel algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework. At the algorithm level, we observe that high-level features in certain denoising phases show significant similarity, enabling approximate computation. Leveraging this, we propose an adaptive, phase-aware sampling strategy that reduces compute and memory loads. This framework automatically balances image quality and complexity based on the StableDiff model and user requirements. At the hardware level, we design an address-centric dataflow to efficiently handle heterogeneous operations within a simple systolic array. We address the bottleneck of nonlinear functions via a two-stage streaming architecture and a reconfigurable vector processing unit. Additionally, we implement adaptive dataflow optimizations by combining dynamic reuse and operator fusion tailored to StableDiff workloads, significantly reducing memory access. Across multiple StableDiff models, our method achieves up to a 3x reduction in computational demand without compromising image quality. Combined with our optimized hardware accelerator, SD-Acc delivers higher speed and energy efficiency than traditional CPU and GPU implementations.</p></details> | Under Review |

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Existing metrics are limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos. Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising 2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5% quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive, human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2 and AIGVE-MACS at https://huggingface.co/xiaoliux/AIGVE-MACS.</p></details> | Working in Progress |

We introduce ConceptAttention, a novel method that leverages the expressive power of DiT attention layers to generate high-quality saliency maps that precisely locate textual concepts within images. Without requiring additional training, ConceptAttention repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce highly contextualized concept embeddings, contributing the major discovery that performing linear projections in the output space of DiT attention layers yields significantly sharper saliency maps compared to commonly used cross-attention maps. ConceptAttention even achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot image segmentation benchmarks, outperforming 15 other zero-shot interpretability methods on the ImageNet-Segmentation dataset. ConceptAttention works for popular image models and even seamlessly generalizes to video generation.

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |

While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://robot4dgen.github.io</p></details> |

| **[Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15857v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks. However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models. Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels, resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models. Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Distribution Matching for Diffusion Distillation Towards Efficient Image and Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18569v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient image and video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> |

Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance, and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models. Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Diffuse and Disperse: Image Generation with Representation Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09027v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm, offering improved controllability, bidirectional context modeling, and robust generation. However, their application to the audio modality remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{DIFFA}, the first diffusion-based Large Audio-Language Model designed to perform spoken language understanding. DIFFA integrates a frozen diffusion language model with a lightweight dual-adapter architecture that bridges speech understanding and natural language reasoning. We employ a two-stage training pipeline: first, aligning semantic representations via an ASR objective; then, learning instruction-following abilities through synthetic audio-caption pairs automatically generated by prompting LLMs. Despite being trained on only 960 hours of ASR and 127 hours of synthetic instruction data, DIFFA demonstrates competitive performance on major benchmarks, including MMSU, MMAU, and VoiceBench, outperforming several autoregressive open-source baselines. Our results reveal the potential of diffusion-based language models for efficient and scalable audio understanding, opening a new direction for speech-driven AI.

However, enabling precise control of continuous attributes, especially multiple attributes simultaneously, in a new domain (e.g., numeric values like eye openness or car width) with text-only guidance remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Attribute (Att) Adapter, a novel plug-and-play module designed to enable fine-grained, multi-attributes control in pretrained diffusion models. Our approach learns a single control adapter from a set of sample images that can be unpaired and contain multiple visual attributes. The Att-Adapter leverages the decoupled cross attention module to naturally harmonize the multiple domain attributes with text conditioning. We further introduce Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to the Att-Adapter to mitigate overfitting, matching the diverse nature of the visual world. Evaluations on two public datasets show that Att-Adapter outperforms all LoRA-based baselines in controlling continuous attributes. Additionally, our method enables a broader control range and also improves disentanglement across multiple attributes, surpassing StyleGAN-based techniques. Notably, Att-Adapter is flexible, requiring no paired synthetic data for training, and is easily scalable to multiple attributes within a single model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV'...</summary><p>ICCV'25 (Highlight), The project page is available at https://tri-mac.github.io/att-adapter/</p></details> |

As an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality, effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in complex environments.

The inherent randomness in diffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical images and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a promising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current training and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven distribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer training times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a novel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a unified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces a staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction targets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention across all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through pre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate performance on six different organs across various imaging modalities. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.

Instead of using classification methods to identify which particles are from the primary collision, a generative model is trained to predict the constituents of the hard-scatter particle jets with pile-up removed. This results in an estimate of the full posterior over hard-scatter jet constituents, which has not yet been explored in the context of pile-up removal, yielding a clear advantage over existing methods especially in the presence of imperfect detector efficiency. We evaluate the performance of vipr in a sample of jets from simulated $t\bar{t}$ events overlain with pile-up contamination. vipr outperforms softdrop and has comparable performance to puppiml in predicting the substructure of the hard-scatter jets over a wide range of pile-up scenarios.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries, researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.

However, the slow sampling speed limits the practical application of diffusion-based scene completion models since autonomous vehicles require an efficient perception of surrounding environments. This paper proposes a novel distillation method tailored for 3D Li- DAR scene completion models, dubbed ScoreLiDAR, which achieves efficient yet high-quality scene completion. Score- LiDAR enables the distilled model to sample in significantly fewer steps after distillation. To improve completion quality, we also introduce a novel Structural Loss, which encourages the distilled model to capture the geometric structure of the 3D LiDAR scene. The loss contains a scene-wise term constraining the holistic structure and a point-wise term constraining the key landmark points and their relative configuration.

| **[LEAF: Latent Diffusion with Efficient Encoder Distillation for Aligned Features in Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18214v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing methods typically transfer the original training process directly without specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction. Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Degradation-Consistent Learning via Bidirectional Diffusion for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18144v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities. However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation. By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally, we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation scenarios.

However, CT scans entail higher costs, greater radiation exposure, and are less accessible than CXRs. In this work we explore cross-modal translation from a 2D low contrast-resolution X-ray input to a 3D high contrast and spatial-resolution CTPA scan. Driven by recent advances in generative AI, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to this task. We evaluate the models performance using both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from radiologists, ensuring diagnostic relevance of the generated images. Furthermore, we employ the synthesized 3D images in a classification framework and show improved AUC in a PE categorization task, using the initial CXR input. The proposed method is generalizable and capable of performing additional cross-modality translations in medical imaging. It may pave the way for more accessible and cost-effective advanced diagnostic tools.

| **[Trigger without Trace: Towards Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17724v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor attacks targeting text-to-image diffusion models have advanced rapidly. However, current backdoor samples often exhibit two key abnormalities compared to benign samples: 1) Semantic Consistency, where backdoor prompts tend to generate images with similar semantic content even with significant textual variations to the prompts; 2) Attention Consistency, where the trigger induces consistent structural responses in the cross-attention maps. These consistencies leave detectable traces for defenders, making backdoors easier to identify. In this paper, toward stealthy backdoor samples, we propose Trigger without Trace (TwT) by explicitly mitigating these consistencies. Specifically, our approach leverages syntactic structures as backdoor triggers to amplify the sensitivity to textual variations, effectively breaking down the semantic consistency. Besides, a regularization method based on Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KMMD) is proposed to align the distribution of cross-attention responses between backdoor and benign samples, thereby disrupting attention consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 97.5% attack success rate while exhibiting stronger resistance to defenses. It achieves an average of over 98% backdoor samples bypassing three state-of-the-art detection mechanisms, revealing the vulnerabilities of current backdoor defense methods.

| **[PolarAnything: Diffusion-based Polarimetric Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17268v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polarization images facilitate image enhancement and 3D reconstruction tasks, but the limited accessibility of polarization cameras hinders their broader application. This gap drives the need for synthesizing photorealistic polarization images. The existing polarization simulator Mitsuba relies on a parametric polarization image formation model and requires extensive 3D assets covering shape and PBR materials, preventing it from generating large-scale photorealistic images. To address this problem, we propose PolarAnything, capable of synthesizing polarization images from a single RGB input with both photorealism and physical accuracy, eliminating the dependency on 3D asset collections. Drawing inspiration from the zero-shot performance of pretrained diffusion models, we introduce a diffusion-based generative framework with an effective representation strategy that preserves the fidelity of polarization properties. Experiments show that our model generates high-quality polarization images and supports downstream tasks like shape from polarization.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[History-Guided Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06764v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a key technique for improving conditional generation in diffusion models, enabling more accurate control while enhancing sample quality. It is natural to extend this technique to video diffusion, which generates video conditioned on a variable number of context frames, collectively referred to as history. However, we find two key challenges to guiding with variable-length history: architectures that only support fixed-size conditioning, and the empirical observation that CFG-style history dropout performs poorly. To address this, we propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), a video diffusion architecture and theoretically grounded training objective that jointly enable conditioning on a flexible number of history frames. We then introduce History Guidance, a family of guidance methods uniquely enabled by DFoT. We show that its simplest form, vanilla history guidance, already significantly improves video generation quality and temporal consistency. A more advanced method, history guidance across time and frequency further enhances motion dynamics, enables compositional generalization to out-of-distribution history, and can stably roll out extremely long videos.

State-of-the-art methods alleviate such overhead in parallel diffusion inference through computation-communication overlapping, termed displaced parallelism. However, we identify that these techniques induce severe *staleness*-the usage of outdated activations from previous timesteps that significantly degrades quality, especially in expert-parallel scenarios. We tackle this fundamental tension and propose DICE, a staleness-centric optimization framework with a three-fold approach: (1) Interweaved Parallelism introduces staggered pipelines, effectively halving step-level staleness for free; (2) Selective Synchronization operates at layer-level and protects layers vulnerable from staled activations; and (3) Conditional Communication, a token-level, training-free method that dynamically adjusts communication frequency based on token importance. Together, these strategies effectively reduce staleness, achieving 1.26x speedup with minimal quality degradation. Empirical results establish DICE as an effective and scalable solution.

However, most methods perform material decomposition in the image domain as a post-processing step after reconstruction but this procedure does not account for the beam-hardening effect and it results in sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a deep learning procedure called Dual-Energy Decomposition Model-based Diffusion (DEcomp-MoD) for quantitative material decomposition which directly converts the DECT projection data into material images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the spectral DECT model into the deep learning training loss and combining a score-based denoising diffusion learned prior in the material image domain. Importantly the inference optimization loss takes as inputs directly the sinogram and converts to material images through a model-based conditional diffusion model which guarantees consistency of the results. We evaluate the performance with both quantitative and qualitative estimation of the proposed DEcomp-MoD method on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset. Finally, we show that DEcomp-MoD outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised score-based model and supervised deep learning networks, with the potential to be deployed for clinical diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Diffusion Framework for Pseudo-Healthy Brain MRI Inpainting with Enhanced 3D Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17911v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pseudo-healthy image inpainting is an essential preprocessing step for analyzing pathological brain MRI scans. Most current inpainting methods favor slice-wise 2D models for their high in-plane fidelity, but their independence across slices produces discontinuities in the volume. Fully 3D models alleviate this issue, but their high model capacity demands extensive training data for reliable, high-fidelity synthesis -- often impractical in medical settings. We address these limitations with a hierarchical diffusion framework by replacing direct 3D modeling with two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages. An axial diffusion model first yields a coarse, globally consistent inpainting; a coronal diffusion model then refines anatomical details. By combining perpendicular spatial views with adaptive resampling, our method balances data efficiency and volumetric consistency. Our experiments show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both realism and volumetric consistency, making it a promising solution for pseudo-healthy image inpainting.

As a risk mitigation strategy, attributing generative models with neural fingerprinting is emerging as a popular technique. There has been a plethora of recent work that aim for addressing neural fingerprinting. A trade-off between the attribution accuracy and generation quality of such models has been studied extensively. None of the existing methods yet achieved 100% attribution accuracy. However, any model with less than cent percent accuracy is practically non-deployable. In this work, we propose an accurate method to incorporate neural fingerprinting for text-to-image diffusion models leveraging the concepts of cyclic error correcting codes from the literature of coding theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAD-AD: Masked Diffusion for Unsupervised Brain Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16943v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection in brain images is crucial for identifying injuries and pathologies without access to labels. However, the accurate localization of anomalies in medical images remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of brain structures and the scarcity of annotated abnormal data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that incorporates masking within diffusion models, leveraging their generative capabilities to learn robust representations of normal brain anatomy. During training, our model processes only normal brain MRI scans and performs a forward diffusion process in the latent space that adds noise to the features of randomly-selected patches. Following a dual objective, the model learns to identify which patches are noisy and recover their original features. This strategy ensures that the model captures intricate patterns of normal brain structures while isolating potential anomalies as noise in the latent space. At inference, the model identifies noisy patches corresponding to anomalies and generates a normal counterpart for these patches by applying a reverse diffusion process. Our method surpasses existing unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, demonstrating superior performance in generating accurate normal counterparts and localizing anomalies.

| **[Diffusion Factor Models: Generating High-Dimensional Returns with Factor Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06566v4)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial scenario simulation is essential for risk management and portfolio optimization, yet it remains challenging especially in high-dimensional and small data settings common in finance. We propose a diffusion factor model that integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes, bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4} n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable for markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior performance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical analysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in constructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work presents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion models, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial simulation with limited data.

| **[Context Diffusion: In-Context Aware Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03584v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Context Diffusion, a diffusion-based framework that enables image generation models to learn from visual examples presented in context. Recent work tackles such in-context learning for image generation, where a query image is provided alongside context examples and text prompts. However, the quality and context fidelity of the generated images deteriorate when the prompt is not present, demonstrating that these models cannot truly learn from the visual context. To address this, we propose a novel framework that separates the encoding of the visual context and the preservation of the desired image layout. This results in the ability to learn from the visual context and prompts, but also from either of them. Furthermore, we enable our model to handle few-shot settings, to effectively address diverse in-context learning scenarios. Our experiments and human evaluation demonstrate that Context Diffusion excels in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, resulting in an overall enhancement in image quality and context fidelity compared to counterpart models.</p></details> |  |

To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of RIS-assisted systems critically depends on accurate channel state information (CSI). To address this challenge, this letter proposes a novel channel estimation method for RIS-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems based on diffusion models (DMs). Specifically, the forward diffusion process of the original signal is formulated to model the received signal as a noisy observation within the framework of DMs. Subsequently, the channel estimation task is formulated as the reverse diffusion process, and a sampling algorithm based on denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) is developed to enable effective inference. Furthermore, a lightweight neural network, termed BRCNet, is introduced to replace the conventional U-Net, significantly reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity. Extensive experiments conducted under various scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%.

| **[Accelerating Parallel Diffusion Model Serving with Residual Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17511v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices, limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations, saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information. To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On 4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method. CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings, and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework. Portable implementation demonstrated on xDiT is publicly available at https://github.com/Cobalt-27/CompactFusion</p></details> |  |

A critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language: poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings. Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced information capture in the generated images.</p></details> | ECAI 2025 |

Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation (DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation, while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions.

Quantization offers an effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However, existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations, which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream deployment tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoDA: Multi-modal Diffusion Architecture for Talking Head Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03256v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a crucial problem in the realm of the virtual metaverse. Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this field with their strong generation capabilities. However, several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference and visual artifacts caused by the implicit latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which complicates the diffusion process; 2) a lack of authentic facial expressions and head movements due to inadequate multi-modal information fusion. In this paper, MoDA handles these challenges by: 1) defining a joint parameter space that bridges motion generation and neural rendering, and leveraging flow matching to simplify diffusion learning; 2) introducing a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, enhancing overall facial expressiveness. In addition, a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy is employed to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring effective feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MoDA improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.

In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical features maintained by Masked AutoEncoders. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders (LDMAEs).</p></details> |  |

However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention (TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment. When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead. We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance, attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models.

| **[Tabular Diffusion based Actionable Counterfactual Explanations for Network Intrusion Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17161v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) frequently utilize the predictive power of complex deep learning models. However, the "black-box" nature of such deep learning methods adds a layer of opaqueness that hinders the proper understanding of detection decisions, trust in the decisions and prevent timely countermeasures against such attacks. Explainable AI (XAI) methods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the causes of the predictions. The majority of the existing XAI methods provide explanations which are not convenient to convert into actionable countermeasures. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based counterfactual explanation framework that can provide actionable explanations for network intrusion attacks. We evaluated our proposed algorithm against several other publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3 modern network intrusion datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work also presents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation algorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our proposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the tested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by reducing the time to generate explanations. We also demonstrate how counterfactual explanations can provide actionable explanations by summarizing them to create a set of global rules. These rules are actionable not only at instance level but also at the global level for intrusion attacks. These global counterfactual rules show the ability to effectively filter out incoming attack queries which is crucial for efficient intrusion detection and defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Parasite-1715/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gungnir: Exploiting Stylistic Features in Images for Backdoor Attacks on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20650v4)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated significant advances in the field of image generation. However, according to current research, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to control the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such as a specific visual patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well equipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger inversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input spaces and low-dimensional triggers. For example, visual triggers are easily observed by defenders, text-based or attention-based triggers are more susceptible to neural network detection. To explore more possibilities of backdoor attack in DMs, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables attackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through style triggers within input images. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the first time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image-to-image tasks by introducing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term Timesteps-Retention (STTR). Our technique generates trigger-embedded images that are perceptually indistinguishable from clean images, thus bypassing both manual inspection and automated detection neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that Gungnir can easily bypass existing defense methods. Among existing DM defense frameworks, our approach achieves a 0 backdoor detection rate (BDR). Our codes are available at https://github.com/paoche11/Gungnir.</p></details> |  |

Existing training-free acceleration strategies that reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling time, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We hypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts correspond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not consider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this paper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a novel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a single stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative models (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates sparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled approximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the numerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using both EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\ge 1.8\times$ speedups with minimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\leq 0.10$ and FID $\leq 4.5$) compared to unmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, SADA adapts seamlessly to other pipelines and modalities: It accelerates ControlNet without any modifications and speeds up MusicLDM by $1.8\times$ with $\sim 0.01$ spectrogram LPIPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published by ICML 2025.

We address this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture. First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date, consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1) Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications, from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle some of these tasks. We present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that uses only a single discrete diffusion model to handle diverse drug discovery scenarios. GenMol generates Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing the utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering while having better sampling efficiency. GenMol uses fragments as basic building blocks for molecules and introduces fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by regenerating masked fragments, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. We further propose molecular context guidance (MCG), a guidance method tailored for masked discrete diffusion of GenMol. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design.

The Diffuse Domain Method (DDM) is an alternative that reformulates the partial differential equations on a larger, simpler domain. The original geometry is embedded into the problem by representing it with a phase-field function. This paper introduces ddfem, an extensible Python package to provide a framework for transforming PDEs into a Diffuse Domain formulation. We aim to make the application of a variety of different Diffuse Domain approaches more accessible and straightforward to use. The ddfem package includes features to intuitively define complex domains by combining signed distance functions and provides a number of DDM transformers for general second evolution equations. In addition, we present a new approach for combining multiple boundary conditions of different types on distinct boundary segments. This is achieved by applying a normalised weighting, derived from multiple phase fields, to combine the additional boundary terms in the Diffuse Domain formulations. The domain definition and Diffuse Domain transformation provided by our package are designed to be compatible with a wide range of existing finite element solvers without requiring code alterations. Both the original (non-linear) PDEs provided by the user and the resulting transformed PDEs on the extended domain are defined using the Unified Form Language UFL which is a domain specific language used by a number of software packages. Our experiments were carried out using the Dune-Fem framework.</p></details> |  |

Addressing these challenges requires architectures that are robust to the unique complexities posed by medical imaging data. Rapid advancements in vision-language foundation models within the natural image domain prompt the question of how they can be adapted for medical imaging tasks. In this work, we present PRISM, a framework that leverages foundation models to generate high-resolution, language-guided medical image counterfactuals using Stable Diffusion. Our approach demonstrates unprecedented precision in selectively modifying spurious correlations (the medical devices) and disease features, enabling the removal and addition of specific attributes while preserving other image characteristics. Through extensive evaluation, we show how PRISM advances counterfactual generation and enables the development of more robust downstream classifiers for clinically deployable solutions.

Motivated by these limitations, we introduce HarmonPaint, a training-free inpainting framework that seamlessly integrates with the attention mechanisms of diffusion models to achieve high-quality, harmonized image inpainting without any form of training. By leveraging masking strategies within self-attention, HarmonPaint ensures structural fidelity without model retraining or fine-tuning. Additionally, we exploit intrinsic diffusion model properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions, achieving a harmonious integration of styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HarmonPaint across diverse scenes and styles, validating its versatility and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding Dori: Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Is Less Local Than Assumed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16880v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[VitaGlyph: Vitalizing Artistic Typography with Flexible Dual-branch Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01738v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artistic typography is a technique to visualize the meaning of input character in an imaginable and readable manner. With powerful text-to-image diffusion models, existing methods directly design the overall geometry and texture of input character, making it challenging to ensure both creativity and legibility. In this paper, we introduce a dual-branch, training-free method called VitaGlyph, enabling flexible artistic typography with controllable geometry changes while maintaining the readability. The key insight of VitaGlyph is to treat input character as a scene composed of a Subject and its Surrounding, which are rendered with varying degrees of geometric transformation. To enhance the visual appeal and creativity of the generated artistic typography, the subject flexibly expresses the essential concept of the input character, while the surrounding enriches relevant background without altering the shape, thus maintaining overall readability. Specifically, we implement VitaGlyph through a three-phase framework: (i) Knowledge Acquisition leverages large language models to design text descriptions for the subject and surrounding. (ii) Regional Interpretation detects the part that most closely matches the subject description and refines the structure via Semantic Typography. (iii) Attentional Compositional Generation separately renders the textures of the Subject and Surrounding regions and blends them in an attention-based manner. Experimental results demonstrate that VitaGlyph not only achieves better artistry and readability but also manages to depict multiple customized concepts, facilitating more creative and pleasing artistic typography generation. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Carlofkl/VitaGlyph</p></details> |

The paper presents a novel image synthesis network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers. Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows significant advantages over other methods.

Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors. This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV), which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under the semi-supervised learning setting. This work presents a robust and data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong potential for a wide range of clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-aware Diffusion-Enhanced architecture using contrastive learning paradigms (KDiffE) for multimedia recommendations. Specifically, we first utilize original user-item graphs to build an attention-aware matrix into graph neural networks, which can learn the importance between users and items for main view construction. The attention-aware matrix is constructed by adopting a random walk with a restart strategy, which can preserve the importance between users and items to generate aggregation of attention-aware node features. Then, we propose a guided diffusion model to generate strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs with less noise for constructing a knowledge-aware contrastive view, which utilizes user embeddings with an edge connected to an item to guide the generation of strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs for enhancing the item's semantic information. We perform comprehensive experiments on three multimedia datasets that reveal the effectiveness of our KDiffE and its components on various state-of-the-art methods.

The semantics, context, and structure of an image can evoke emotional responses, making emotional image editing techniques valuable for various real-world applications, including treatment of psychological disorders, commercialization of products, and artistic design. First, we present a novel challenge of emotion-evoked image generation, aiming to synthesize images that evoke target emotions while retaining the semantics and structures of the original scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion model capable of effectively understanding and editing source images to convey desired emotions and sentiments. Moreover, due to the lack of emotion editing datasets, we provide a unique dataset consisting of 340,000 pairs of images and their emotion annotations. Furthermore, we conduct human psychophysics experiments and introduce a new evaluation metric to systematically benchmark all the methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses all competitive baselines. Our diffusion model is capable of identifying emotional cues from original images, editing images that elicit desired emotions, and meanwhile, preserving the semantic structure of the original images.

However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

Although existing methods based on either implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model (FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM) that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging scenarios with extreme pose variations.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity, they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation, ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets, fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

Anomaly detection methods also fall into this scope and utilize diffusion models to generate or reconstruct normal samples when given arbitrary anomaly images. However, our study found that the diffusion model suffers from severe ``faithfulness hallucination'' and ``catastrophic forgetting'', which can't meet the unpredictable pattern increments. To mitigate the above problems, we propose a continual diffusion model that uses gradient projection to achieve stable continual learning. Gradient projection deploys a regularization on the model updating by modifying the gradient towards the direction protecting the learned knowledge. But as a double-edged sword, it also requires huge memory costs brought by the Markov process. Hence, we propose an iterative singular value decomposition method based on the transitive property of linear representation, which consumes tiny memory and incurs almost no performance loss. Finally, considering the risk of ``over-fitting'' to normal images of the diffusion model, we propose an anomaly-masked network to enhance the condition mechanism of the diffusion model. For continual anomaly detection, ours achieves first place in 17/18 settings on MVTec and VisA. Code is available at https://github.com/FuNz-0/One-for-More</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

Existing methods for addressing ECG noise, relying on artifact classification or denoising, are constrained by annotation inconsistencies and poor generalizability. Here, we address these limitations by reframing ECG noise quantification as an anomaly detection task. We propose a diffusion-based framework trained to model the normative distribution of clean ECG signals, identifying deviations as noise without requiring explicit artifact labels. To robustly evaluate performance and mitigate label inconsistencies, we introduce a distribution-based metric using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$).

| **[Diffusion-Modeled Reinforcement Learning for Carbon and Risk-Aware Microgrid Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16867v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces DiffCarl, a diffusion-modeled carbon- and risk-aware reinforcement learning algorithm for intelligent operation of multi-microgrid systems. With the growing integration of renewables and increasing system complexity, microgrid communities face significant challenges in real-time energy scheduling and optimization under uncertainty. DiffCarl integrates a diffusion model into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable adaptive energy scheduling under uncertainty and explicitly account for carbon emissions and operational risk. By learning action distributions through a denoising generation process, DiffCarl enhances DRL policy expressiveness and enables carbon- and risk-aware scheduling in dynamic and uncertain microgrid environments. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that it outperforms classic algorithms and state-of-the-art DRL solutions, with 2.3-30.1% lower operational cost. It also achieves 28.7% lower carbon emissions than those of its carbon-unaware variant and reduces performance variability. These results highlight DiffCarl as a practical and forward-looking solution. Its flexible design allows efficient adaptation to different system configurations and objectives to support real-world deployment in evolving energy systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[LSSGen: Leveraging Latent Space Scaling in Flow and Diffusion for Efficient Text to Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16154v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches. When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\% TOPIQ score improvement.</p></details> | ICCV AIGENS 2025 |
| **[Exponential Runge-Kutta Galerkin finite element method for a reaction-diffusion system with nonsmooth initial data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15345v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a numerical analysis of the Field-Noyes reaction-diffusion model with nonsmooth initial data, employing a linear Galerkin finite element method for spatial discretization and a second-order exponential Runge-Kutta scheme for temporal integration. The initial data are assumed to reside in the fractional Sobolev space H^gamma with 0 < gamma < 2, where classical regularity conditions are violated, necessitating specialized error analysis. By integrating semigroup techniques and fractional Sobolev space theory, sharp fully discrete error estimates are derived in both L2 and H1 norms. This demonstrates that the convergence order adapts to the smoothness of initial data, a key advancement over traditional approaches that assume higher regularity. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DP-TLDM: Differentially Private Tabular Latent Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07842v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data from generative models emerges as the privacy-preserving data sharing solution. Such a synthetic data set shall resemble the original data without revealing identifiable private information. Till date, the prior focus on limited types of tabular synthesizers and a small number of privacy attacks, particularly on Generative Adversarial Networks, and overlooks membership inference attacks and defense strategies, i.e., differential privacy. Motivated by the conundrum of keeping high data quality and low privacy risk of synthetic data tables, we propose DPTLDM, Differentially Private Tabular Latent Diffusion Model, which is composed of an autoencoder network to encode the tabular data and a latent diffusion model to synthesize the latent tables. Following the emerging f-DP framework, we apply DP-SGD to train the auto-encoder in combination with batch clipping and use the separation value as the privacy metric to better capture the privacy gain from DP algorithms. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that DPTLDM is capable of achieving a meaningful theoretical privacy guarantee while also significantly enhancing the utility of synthetic data. Specifically, compared to other DP-protected tabular generative models, DPTLDM improves the synthetic quality by an average of 35% in data resemblance, 15% in the utility for downstream tasks, and 50% in data discriminability, all while preserving a comparable level of privacy risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Researcher with Test-Time Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16075v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex, long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Diversity and Control in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10637v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilled diffusion models suffer from a critical limitation: reduced sample diversity compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of sample-diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we utilize $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{0}$ visualization as an analysis and debugging tool to reveal how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{0}$ visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications.

| **[FiVE: A Fine-grained Video Editing Benchmark for Evaluating Emerging Diffusion and Rectified Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13684v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous text-to-video (T2V) editing methods have emerged recently, but the lack of a standardized benchmark for fair evaluation has led to inconsistent claims and an inability to assess model sensitivity to hyperparameters. Fine-grained video editing is crucial for enabling precise, object-level modifications while maintaining context and temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce FiVE, a Fine-grained Video Editing Benchmark for evaluating emerging diffusion and rectified flow models. Our benchmark includes 74 real-world videos and 26 generated videos, featuring 6 fine-grained editing types, 420 object-level editing prompt pairs, and their corresponding masks. Additionally, we adapt the latest rectified flow (RF) T2V generation models, Pyramid-Flow and Wan2.1, by introducing FlowEdit, resulting in training-free and inversion-free video editing models Pyramid-Edit and Wan-Edit. We evaluate five diffusion-based and two RF-based editing methods on our FiVE benchmark using 15 metrics, covering background preservation, text-video similarity, temporal consistency, video quality, and runtime. To further enhance object-level evaluation, we introduce FiVE-Acc, a novel metric leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to assess the success of fine-grained video editing. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-based editing significantly outperforms diffusion-based methods, with Wan-Edit achieving the best overall performance and exhibiting the least sensitivity to hyperparameters.

| **[Diffusion models for multivariate subsurface generation and efficient probabilistic inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15809v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffuMeta: Algebraic Language Models for Inverse Design of Metamaterials via Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15753v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative machine learning models have revolutionized material discovery by capturing complex structure-property relationships, yet extending these approaches to the inverse design of three-dimensional metamaterials remains limited by computational complexity and underexplored design spaces due to the lack of expressive representations. Here, we present DiffuMeta, a generative framework integrating diffusion transformers with a novel algebraic language representation, encoding 3D geometries as mathematical sentences. This compact, unified parameterization spans diverse topologies while enabling direct application of transformers to structural design. DiffuMeta leverages diffusion models to generate novel shell structures with precisely targeted stress-strain responses under large deformations, accounting for buckling and contact while addressing the inherent one-to-many mapping by producing diverse solutions. Uniquely, our approach enables simultaneous control over multiple mechanical objectives, including linear and nonlinear responses beyond training domains. Experimental validation of fabricated structures further confirms the efficacy of our approach for accelerated design of metamaterials and structures with tailored properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffPF: Differentiable Particle Filtering with Generative Sampling via Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15716v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes DiffPF, a differentiable particle filter that leverages diffusion models for state estimation in dynamic systems. Unlike conventional differentiable particle filters, which require importance weighting and typically rely on predefined or low-capacity proposal distributions. DiffPF learns a flexible posterior sampler by conditioning a diffusion model on predicted particles and the current observation. This enables accurate, equally-weighted sampling from complex, high-dimensional, and multimodal filtering distributions. We evaluate DiffPF across a range of scenarios, including both unimodal and highly multimodal distributions, and test it on simulated as well as real-world tasks, where it consistently outperforms existing filtering baselines. In particular, DiffPF achieves an 82.8% improvement in estimation accuracy on a highly multimodal global localization benchmark, and a 26% improvement on the real-world KITTI visual odometry benchmark, compared to state-of-the-art differentiable filters. To the best of our knowledge, DiffPF is the first method to integrate conditional diffusion models into particle filtering, enabling high-quality posterior sampling that produces more informative particles and significantly improves state estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[BackdoorDM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Backdoor Learning on Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11798v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor learning is a critical research topic for understanding the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks. While the diffusion model (DM) has been broadly deployed in public over the past few years, the understanding of its backdoor vulnerability is still in its infancy compared to the extensive studies in discriminative models. Recently, many different backdoor attack and defense methods have been proposed for DMs, but a comprehensive benchmark for backdoor learning on DMs is still lacking. This absence makes it difficult to conduct fair comparisons and thorough evaluations of the existing approaches, thus hindering future research progress. To address this issue, we propose \textit{BackdoorDM}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for backdoor learning on DMs. It comprises nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods, four SOTA defense strategies, and three useful visualization analysis tools. We first systematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a unified framework, focusing on three different backdoor attack types and five backdoor target types, which are restricted to a single type in discriminative models. Then, we systematically summarize the evaluation metrics for each type and propose a unified backdoor evaluation method based on multimodal large language model (MLLM). Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and highlight several important conclusions. We believe that BackdoorDM will help overcome current barriers and contribute to building a trustworthy artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) community. The codes are released in https://github.com/linweiii/BackdoorDM.</p></details> |  |
| **[SustainDiffusion: Optimising the Social and Environmental Sustainability of Stable Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15663v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Text-to-image generation models are widely used across numerous domains. Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source text-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12 billion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises concerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability. Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the environment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to enhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models. Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters and prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated images while also lowering the energy consumption required for image generation. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to that of the original SD model. Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion, testing it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our results demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%, ethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and GPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are consistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts. Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social and environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible without fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.</p></details> |  |
