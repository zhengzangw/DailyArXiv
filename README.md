| **[MV-S2V: Multi-View Subject-Consistent Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17756v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Subject-to-Video Generation (S2V) methods have achieved high-fidelity and subject-consistent video generation, yet remain constrained to single-view subject references. This limitation renders the S2V task reducible to an S2I + I2V pipeline, failing to exploit the full potential of video subject control. In this work, we propose and address the challenging Multi-View S2V (MV-S2V) task, which synthesizes videos from multiple reference views to enforce 3D-level subject consistency. Regarding the scarcity of training data, we first develop a synthetic data curation pipeline to generate highly customized synthetic data, complemented by a small-scale real-world captured dataset to boost the training of MV-S2V. Another key issue lies in the potential confusion between cross-subject and cross-view references in conditional generation. To overcome this, we further introduce Temporally Shifted RoPE (TS-RoPE) to distinguish between different subjects and distinct views of the same subject in reference conditioning. Our framework achieves superior 3D subject consistency w.r.t. multi-view reference images and high-quality visual outputs, establishing a new meaningful direction for subject-driven video generation.

In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual quality and structural stability compared to static top-k/top-p strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Astra: General Interactive World Model with Autoregressive Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08931v3)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion transformers have empowered video generation models to generate high-quality video clips from texts or images. However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2026.

| **[VC-Bench: Pioneering the Video Connecting Benchmark with a Dataset and Evaluation Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19236v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While current video generation focuses on text or image conditions, practical applications like video editing and vlogging often need to seamlessly connect separate clips. In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in maintaining start-end consistency and transition smoothness, leading to lower overall coherence and fluidity. We expect that VC-Bench will serve as a pioneering benchmark to inspire and guide future research in video connecting. The evaluation metrics and dataset are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VC-Bench-1B67/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SVBench: Evaluation of Video Generation Models on Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21507v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-video generation models exhibit remarkable progress in visual realism, motion fidelity, and text-video alignment, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their ability to generate socially coherent behavior. Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.</p></details> | 10pages |
| **[The Script is All You Need: An Agentic Framework for Long-Horizon Dialogue-to-Cinematic Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17737v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation have produced models capable of synthesizing stunning visual content from simple text prompts. However, these models struggle to generate long-form, coherent narratives from high-level concepts like dialogue, revealing a ``semantic gap'' between a creative idea and its cinematic execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel, end-to-end agentic framework for dialogue-to-cinematic-video generation. Central to our framework is ScripterAgent, a model trained to translate coarse dialogue into a fine-grained, executable cinematic script. To enable this, we construct ScriptBench, a new large-scale benchmark with rich multimodal context, annotated via an expert-guided pipeline. The generated script then guides DirectorAgent, which orchestrates state-of-the-art video models using a cross-scene continuous generation strategy to ensure long-horizon coherence. Our comprehensive evaluation, featuring an AI-powered CriticAgent and a new Visual-Script Alignment (VSA) metric, shows our framework significantly improves script faithfulness and temporal fidelity across all tested video models. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a crucial trade-off in current SOTA models between visual spectacle and strict script adherence, providing valuable insights for the future of automated filmmaking.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreeOrbit4D: Training-Free Arbitrary Camera Redirection for Monocular Videos via Geometry-Complete 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18993v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera redirection aims to replay a dynamic scene from a single monocular video under a user-specified camera trajectory. However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation. Project page and code will be released soon.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Learning Video Generation for Robotic Manipulation with Collaborative Trajectory Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01943v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models shows promise for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex manipulation. This limitation arises from entangled features in overlapping regions, leading to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics via a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction, and models each phase using the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction. This design effectively alleviates the multi-object feature fusion issue in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency across the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge dataset, as well as RLBench and SIMPLER benchmarks, demonstrate that our method establishs new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

| **[HiCache: A Plug-in Scaled-Hermite Upgrade for Taylor-Style Cache-then-Forecast Diffusion Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16984v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but often incur prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. Recent feature caching methods accelerate inference via temporal extrapolation, yet can suffer quality degradation from inaccurate modeling of the complex dynamics of feature evolution. We propose HiCache (Hermite Polynomial-based Feature Cache), a training-free acceleration framework that improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature-derivative approximations in diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials as a potentially optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy, and is also effective when applied standalone or integrated with TaylorSeer. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority, achieving 5.55x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while matching or exceeding baseline quality, and maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Moreover, HiCache can be naturally added to previous caching methods to enhance their performance, e.g., improving ClusCa from 0.9480 to 0.9840 in terms of image rewards.

| **[Are Video Generation Models Geographically Fair? An Attraction-Centric Evaluation of Global Visual Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18698v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced visually compelling results, yet it remains unclear whether these models encode geographically equitable visual knowledge. In this work, we investigate the geo-equity and geographically grounded visual knowledge of text-to-video models through an attraction-centric evaluation. We introduce Geo-Attraction Landmark Probing (GAP), a systematic framework for assessing how faithfully models synthesize tourist attractions from diverse regions, and construct GEOATTRACTION-500, a benchmark of 500 globally distributed attractions spanning varied regions and popularity levels. GAP integrates complementary metrics that disentangle overall video quality from attraction-specific knowledge, including global structural alignment, fine-grained keypoint-based alignment, and vision-language model judgments, all validated against human evaluation. Applying GAP to the state-of-the-art text-to-video model Sora 2, we find that, contrary to common assumptions of strong geographic bias, the model exhibits a relatively uniform level of geographically grounded visual knowledge across regions, development levels, and cultural groupings, with only weak dependence on attraction popularity. These results suggest that current text-to-video models express global visual knowledge more evenly than expected, highlighting both their promise for globally deployed applications and the need for continued evaluation as such systems evolve.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[LLMPopcorn: Exploring LLMs as Assistants for Popular Micro-video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12945v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era where micro-videos dominate platforms like TikTok and YouTube, AI-generated content is nearing cinematic quality. The next frontier is using large language models (LLMs) to autonomously create viral micro-videos, a largely untapped potential that could shape the future of AI-driven content creation. To address this gap, this paper presents the first exploration of LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn). We selected popcorn as the icon for this paper because it symbolizes leisure and entertainment, aligning with this study on leveraging LLMs as assistants for generating popular micro-videos that are often consumed during leisure time. Specifically, we empirically study the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation? (ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity? (iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task? Exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 can generate micro-videos with popularity rivaling human content. Prompt enhancement further boosts results, while benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and R1 for LLMs, and LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo for video generation. This work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation and opens new research directions. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/GAIR-Lab/LLMPopcorn.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2026</p></details> |
| **[DVD-Quant: Data-free Video Diffusion Transformers Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18663v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture for video generation, yet their computational and memory demands hinder practical deployment. While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) dependence on computation-heavy and inflexible calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) Bounded-init Grid Refinement (BGR) and (2) Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization error reduction, as well as (3) $δ$-Guided Bit Switching ($δ$-GBS) for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately 2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on advanced DiT models while maintaining visual fidelity. Notably, DVD-Quant is the first to enable W4A4 PTQ for Video DiTs without compromising video quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/lhxcs/DVD-Quant.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models will be available at https://github.com/lhxcs/DVD-Quant</p></details> |
| **[Self-Refining Video Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18577v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern video generators still struggle with complex physical dynamics, often falling short of physical realism. Existing approaches address this using external verifiers or additional training on augmented data, which is computationally expensive and still limited in capturing fine-grained motion. In this work, we present self-refining video sampling, a simple method that uses a pre-trained video generator trained on large-scale datasets as its own self-refiner. By interpreting the generator as a denoising autoencoder, we enable iterative inner-loop refinement at inference time without any external verifier or additional training. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware refinement strategy that selectively refines regions based on self-consistency, which prevents artifacts caused by over-refinement. Experiments on state-of-the-art video generators demonstrate significant improvements in motion coherence and physics alignment, achieving over 70\% human preference compared to the default sampler and guidance-based sampler.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://agwmon.github.io/self-refine-video/</p></details> |
| **[TC-IDM: Grounding Video Generation for Executable Zero-shot Robot Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18323v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm has enabled powerful robotic control by leveraging vision-language models, but its reliance on large-scale, high-quality robot data limits its generalization. Generative world models offer a promising alternative for general-purpose embodied AI, yet a critical gap remains between their pixel-level plans and physically executable actions. To this end, we propose the Tool-Centric Inverse Dynamics Model (TC-IDM). By focusing on the tool's imagined trajectory as synthesized by the world model, TC-IDM establishes a robust intermediate representation that bridges the gap between visual planning and physical control. TC-IDM extracts the tool's point cloud trajectories via segmentation and 3D motion estimation from generated videos. Considering diverse tool attributes, our architecture employs decoupled action heads to project these planned trajectories into 6-DoF end-effector motions and corresponding control signals. This plan-and-translate paradigm not only supports a wide range of end-effectors but also significantly improves viewpoint invariance. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities across long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks, including interacting with deformable objects. In real-world evaluations, the world model with TC-IDM achieves an average success rate of 61.11 percent, with 77.7 percent on simple tasks and 38.46 percent on zero-shot deformable object tasks. It substantially outperforms end-to-end VLA-style baselines and other inverse dynamics models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adams Bashforth Moulton Solver for Inversion and Editing in Rectified Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16522v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rectified flow models have achieved remarkable performance in image and video generation tasks. However, existing numerical solvers face a trade-off between fast sampling and high accuracy solutions, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications such as reconstruction and editing. To address this challenge, we propose leveraging the Adams Bashforth Moulton (ABM) predictor corrector method to enhance the accuracy of ODE solving in rectified flow models. Specifically, we introduce ABM Solver, which integrates a multi step predictor corrector approach to reduce local truncation errors and employs Adaptive Step Size Adjustment to improve sampling speed. Furthermore, to effectively preserve non edited regions while facilitating semantic modifications, we introduce a Mask Guided Feature Injection module. We estimate self-similarity to generate a spatial mask that differentiates preserved regions from those available for editing. Extensive experiments on multiple high resolution image datasets validate that ABM Solver significantly improves inversion precision and editing quality, outperforming existing solvers without requiring additional training or optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photography Perspective Composition: Towards Aesthetic Perspective Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20655v5)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional photography composition approaches are dominated by 2D cropping-based methods. However, these methods fall short when scenes contain poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that demonstrates the transformation process from less favorable to aesthetically enhanced perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users to enhance their composition skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[SkyReels-V3 Technique Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17323v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation serves as a cornerstone for building world models, where multimodal contextual inference stands as the defining test of capability. In this end, we present SkyReels-V3, a conditional video generation model, built upon a unified multimodal in-context learning framework with diffusion Transformers. SkyReels-V3 model supports three core generative paradigms within a single architecture: reference images-to-video synthesis, video-to-video extension and audio-guided video generation. (i) reference images-to-video model is designed to produce high-fidelity videos with strong subject identity preservation, temporal coherence, and narrative consistency. To enhance reference adherence and compositional stability, we design a comprehensive data processing pipeline that leverages cross frame pairing, image editing, and semantic rewriting, effectively mitigating copy paste artifacts. During training, an image video hybrid strategy combined with multi-resolution joint optimization is employed to improve generalization and robustness across diverse scenarios. (ii) video extension model integrates spatio-temporal consistency modeling with large-scale video understanding, enabling both seamless single-shot continuation and intelligent multi-shot switching with professional cinematographic patterns. (iii) Talking avatar model supports minute-level audio-conditioned video generation by training first-and-last frame insertion patterns and reconstructing key-frame inference paradigms. On the basis of ensuring visual quality, synchronization of audio and videos has been optimized. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 achieves state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance on key metrics including visual quality, instruction following, and specific aspect metrics, approaching leading closed-source systems.

| **[MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487v5)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to assist in long-sequence video storytelling by efficiently translating ideas into visual narratives. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief idea description, MAViS enables users to rapidly explore diverse visual storytelling and creative directions for sequential video generation by efficiently producing high-quality, complete long-sequence videos. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video Generation Agent</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce \textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \emph{any} viewpoint.

| **[Reward-Forcing: Autoregressive Video Generation with Reward Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16933v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior work in video generation relies on bidirectional architectures, recent efforts have sought to adapt these models into autoregressive variants to support near real-time generation. However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[LoL: Longer than Longer, Scaling Video Generation to Hour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16914v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in long-form video generation has shifted from bidirectional to autoregressive models, yet these methods commonly suffer from error accumulation and a loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[SALAD: Achieve High-Sparsity Attention via Efficient Linear Attention Tuning for Video Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16515v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in video generation. However, the long input sequences result in high computational latency due to the quadratic complexity of full attention. Various sparse attention mechanisms have been proposed. Training-free sparse attention is constrained by limited sparsity and thus offers modest acceleration, whereas training-based methods can reach much higher sparsity but demand substantial data and computation for training. In this work, we propose SALAD, introducing a lightweight linear attention branch in parallel with the sparse attention. By incorporating an input-dependent gating mechanism to finely balance the two branches, our method attains 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup, while maintaining generation quality comparable to the full attention baseline. Moreover, our finetuning process is highly efficient, requiring only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with a batch size of 8.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advances in Artificial Intelligence: A Review for the Creative Industries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02725v5)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone transformative advances since 2022, particularly through generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and diffusion models, fundamentally reshaping the creative industries. However, existing reviews have not comprehensively addressed these recent breakthroughs and their integrated impact across the creative production pipeline. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic review of AI technologies that have emerged or matured since our 2022 review, examining their applications across content creation, information analysis, post-production enhancement, compression, and quality assessment. We document how transformers, LLMs, diffusion models, and implicit neural representations have established new capabilities in text-to-image/video generation, real-time 3D reconstruction, and unified multi-task frameworks-shifting AI from support tool to core creative technology. Beyond technological advances, we analyze the trend toward unified AI frameworks that integrate multiple creative tasks, replacing task-specific solutions. We critically examine the evolving role of human-AI collaboration, where human oversight remains essential for creative direction and mitigating AI hallucinations. Finally, we identify emerging challenges including copyright concerns, bias mitigation, computational demands, and the need for robust regulatory frameworks. This review provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of current AI capabilities, limitations, and future trajectories in creative applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an updated review of our previous paper (see https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-021-10039-7), and has been accepted by Artificial Intelligence Review journal</p></details> |

Toonify, a StyleGAN-based method, has become widely used for facial image stylization. To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB. In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we adopt an improved StyleGAN to generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which overcomes the limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable stylized video, which enables Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video frames, facilitating the synthesis of high-quality animations in the next stage. In Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), our method learns a stylized neutral head model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated stylized video. By combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the effectiveness of ToonifyGB on benchmark datasets using two representative styles: Arcane and Pixar.</p></details> | <details><summary>2-Pag...</summary><p>2-Page Version Accepted as a Poster at IEEE VR 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Mechanistic View on Video Generation as World Models: State and Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17067v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated emergent physical coherence, positioning them as potential world models. However, a gap remains between contemporary "stateless" video architectures and classic state-centric world model theories. This work bridges this gap by proposing a novel taxonomy centered on two pillars: State Construction and Dynamics Modeling. We categorize state construction into implicit paradigms (context management) and explicit paradigms (latent compression), while dynamics modeling is analyzed through knowledge integration and architectural reformulation. Furthermore, we advocate for a transition in evaluation from visual fidelity to functional benchmarks, testing physical persistence and causal reasoning. We conclude by identifying two critical frontiers: enhancing persistence via data-driven memory and compressed fidelity, and advancing causality through latent factor decoupling and reasoning-prior integration. By addressing these challenges, the field can evolve from generating visually plausible videos to building robust, general-purpose world simulators.</p></details> |  |

We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. PyraTok builds on a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module that discretizes encoder features at several depths using a shared large binary codebook, yielding compact yet expressive video token sequences. To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cosmos Policy: Fine-Tuning Video Models for Visuomotor Control and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16163v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation models demonstrate remarkable ability to capture complex physical interactions and scene evolution over time. To leverage their spatiotemporal priors, robotics works have adapted video models for policy learning but introduce complexity by requiring multiple stages of post-training and new architectural components for action generation. In this work, we introduce Cosmos Policy, a simple approach for adapting a large pretrained video model (Cosmos-Predict2) into an effective robot policy through a single stage of post-training on the robot demonstration data collected on the target platform, with no architectural modifications. Cosmos Policy learns to directly generate robot actions encoded as latent frames within the video model's latent diffusion process, harnessing the model's pretrained priors and core learning algorithm to capture complex action distributions. Additionally, Cosmos Policy generates future state images and values (expected cumulative rewards), which are similarly encoded as latent frames, enabling test-time planning of action trajectories with higher likelihood of success. In our evaluations, Cosmos Policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LIBERO and RoboCasa simulation benchmarks (98.5% and 67.1% average success rates, respectively) and the highest average score in challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, outperforming strong diffusion policies trained from scratch, video model-based policies, and state-of-the-art vision-language-action models fine-tuned on the same robot demonstrations. Furthermore, given policy rollout data, Cosmos Policy can learn from experience to refine its world model and value function and leverage model-based planning to achieve even higher success rates in challenging tasks. We release code, models, and training data at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/cosmos-policy/</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models. Our data will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generative Engines to Actionable Simulators: The Imperative of Physical Grounding in World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15533v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model is an AI system that simulates how an environment evolves under actions, enabling planning through imagined futures rather than reactive perception. Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniView: An All-Seeing Diffusion Model for 3D and 4D View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10940v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior approaches injecting camera control into diffusion models have focused on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks: novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video, amongst others. Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation. With strong generalizability in one model, OmniView demonstrates the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model.

We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions. EgoWM improves SCS by up to 80 percent over prior state-of-the-art navigation world models, while achieving up to six times lower inference latency and robust generalization to unseen environments, including navigation inside paintings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Video Generation Model for the Embodied World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15282v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/DAGroup-PKU/ReVidgen/ Project website: https://dagroup-pku.github.io/ReVidgen.github.io/</p></details> |

Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 21 figures,</p></details> |

We then observe that recent models increasingly support spatial, action, and strategic intelligences in world modeling through adherence to completeness, consistency, invention, as well as human interaction and control.

Yet, they continue to struggle with complex, non-rigid motions, especially when synthesizing humans performing dynamic actions such as sports, dance, etc. Generated videos often exhibit missing or extra limbs, distorted poses, or physically implausible actions. In this work, we propose a remarkably simple reward model, HuDA, to quantify and improve the human motion in generated videos. HuDA integrates human detection confidence for appearance quality, and a temporal prompt alignment score to capture motion realism. We show this simple reward function that leverages off-the-shelf models without any additional training, outperforms specialized models finetuned with manually annotated data. Using HuDA for Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) post-training of video models, we significantly enhance video generation, especially when generating complex human motions, outperforming state-of-the-art models like Wan 2.1, with win-rate of 73%. Finally, we demonstrate that HuDA improves generation quality beyond just humans, for instance, significantly improving generation of animal videos and human-object interactions.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[LaVR: Scene Latent Conditioned Generative Video Trajectory Re-Rendering using Large 4D Reconstruction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14674v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a monocular video, the goal of video re-rendering is to generate views of the scene from a novel camera trajectory. Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors. We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

| **[OmniTransfer: All-in-one Framework for Spatio-temporal Video Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14250v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos convey richer information than images or text, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. However, most existing video customization methods rely on reference images or task-specific temporal priors, failing to fully exploit the rich spatio-temporal information inherent in videos, thereby limiting flexibility and generalization in video generation. To address these limitations, we propose OmniTransfer, a unified framework for spatio-temporal video transfer. It leverages multi-view information across frames to enhance appearance consistency and exploits temporal cues to enable fine-grained temporal control. To unify various video transfer tasks, OmniTransfer incorporates three key designs: Task-aware Positional Bias that adaptively leverages reference video information to improve temporal alignment or appearance consistency; Reference-decoupled Causal Learning separating reference and target branches to enable precise reference transfer while improving efficiency; and Task-adaptive Multimodal Alignment using multimodal semantic guidance to dynamically distinguish and tackle different tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniTransfer outperforms existing methods in appearance (ID and style) and temporal transfer (camera movement and video effects), while matching pose-guided methods in motion transfer without using pose, establishing a new paradigm for flexible, high-fidelity video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Page: https://pangzecheung.github.io/OmniTransfer/</p></details> |
| **[LAViG-FLOW: Latent Autoregressive Video Generation for Fluid Flow Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13190v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling and forecasting subsurface multiphase fluid flow fields underpin applications ranging from geological CO2 sequestration (GCS) operations to geothermal production. This is essential for ensuring both operational performance and long-term safety. While high fidelity multiphase simulators are widely used for this purpose, they become prohibitively expensive once many forward runs are required for inversion purposes and quantify uncertainty. To tackle this challenge we propose LAViG-FLOW, a latent autoregressive video generation diffusion framework that explicitly learns the coupled evolution of saturation and pressure fields. Each state variable is compressed by a dedicated 2D autoencoder, and a Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT) models their coupled distribution across time. We first train the model on a given time horizon to learn their coupled relationship and then fine-tune it autoregressively so it can extrapolate beyond the observed time window. Evaluated on an open-source CO2 sequestration dataset, LAViG-FLOW generates saturation and pressure fields that stay consistent across time while running orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical solvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Moaw: Unleashing Motion Awareness for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12761v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models, trained on large-scale datasets, naturally capture correspondences of shared features across frames. Recent works have exploited this property for tasks such as optical flow prediction and tracking in a zero-shot setting. Motivated by these findings, we investigate whether supervised training can more fully harness the tracking capability of video diffusion models. To this end, we propose Moaw, a framework that unleashes motion awareness for video diffusion models and leverages it to facilitate motion transfer. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for motion perception, shifting its modality from image-to-video generation to video-to-dense-tracking. We then construct a motion-labeled dataset to identify features that encode the strongest motion information, and inject them into a structurally identical video generation model. Owing to the homogeneity between the two networks, these features can be naturally adapted in a zero-shot manner, enabling motion transfer without additional adapters. Our work provides a new paradigm for bridging generative modeling and motion understanding, paving the way for more unified and controllable video learning frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, their heavy computational cost makes real-time or on-device generation infeasible. In this work, we introduce S2DiT, a Streaming Sandwich Diffusion Transformer designed for efficient, high-fidelity, and streaming video generation on mobile hardware. S2DiT generates more tokens but maintains efficiency with novel efficient attentions: a mixture of LinConv Hybrid Attention (LCHA) and Stride Self-Attention (SSA). Based on this, we uncover the sandwich design via a budget-aware dynamic programming search, achieving superior quality and efficiency. We further propose a 2-in-1 distillation framework that transfers the capacity of large teacher models (e.g., Wan 2.2-14B) to the compact few-step sandwich model. Together, S2DiT achieves quality on par with state-of-the-art server video models, while streaming at over 10 FPS on an iPhone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Video Generation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16869v3)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular, the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex, multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models, analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

| **[UVE: Are MLLMs Unified Evaluators for AI-Generated Videos?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09949v4)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of video generative models (VGMs), it is essential to develop reliable and comprehensive automatic metrics for AI-generated videos (AIGVs). Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 18 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-based System for Transforming text and sound to Educational Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17022v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technological developments have produced methods that can generate educational videos from input text or sound. Recently, the use of deep learning techniques for image and video generation has been widely explored, particularly in education. However, generating video content from conditional inputs such as text or speech remains a challenging area. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to the educational structure, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which develop frame-for-frame frameworks and are able to create full educational videos. The proposed system is structured into three main phases In the first phase, the input (either text or speech) is transcribed using speech recognition. In the second phase, key terms are extracted and relevant images are generated using advanced models such as CLIP and diffusion models to enhance visual quality and semantic alignment. In the final phase, the generated images are synthesized into a video format, integrated with either pre-recorded or synthesized sound, resulting in a fully interactive educational video. The proposed system is compared with other systems such as TGAN, MoCoGAN, and TGANS-C, achieving a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score of 28.75%, which indicates improved visual quality and better over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits. Our results highlight a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation, and the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sotamak1r.github.io/VINO-web/</p></details> |
| **[VidLeaks: Membership Inference Attacks Against Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11210v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of powerful Text-to-Video (T2V) models, trained on massive web-scale datasets, raises urgent concerns about copyright and privacy violations. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled tool for auditing such risks, yet existing techniques - designed for static data like images or text - fail to capture the spatio-temporal complexities of video generation. In particular, they overlook the sparsity of memorization signals in keyframes and the instability introduced by stochastic temporal dynamics. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of MIAs against T2V models and introduce a novel framework VidLeaks, which probes sparse-temporal memorization through two complementary signals: 1) Spatial Reconstruction Fidelity (SRF), using a Top-K similarity to amplify spatial memorization signals from sparsely memorized keyframes, and 2) Temporal Generative Stability (TGS), which measures semantic consistency across multiple queries to capture temporal leakage. We evaluate VidLeaks under three progressively restrictive black-box settings - supervised, reference-based, and query-only. Experiments on three representative T2V models reveal severe vulnerabilities: VidLeaks achieves AUC of 82.92% on AnimateDiff and 97.01% on InstructVideo even in the strict query-only setting, posing a realistic and exploitable privacy risk. Our work provides the first concrete evidence that T2V models leak substantial membership information through both sparse and temporal memorization, establishing a foundation for auditing video generation systems and motivating the development of new defenses.

| **[ATATA: One Algorithm to Align Them All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11194v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We suggest a new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples with Rectified Flow models. While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples.

This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations remains a key challenge, and learning such forecasting from noisy, real-world data remains relatively unexplored. We introduce FOFPred, a novel language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model featuring a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Diffusion architecture. This unique combination enables strong multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity for future motion prediction. Our model is trained on web-scale human activity data-a highly scalable but unstructured source. To extract meaningful signals from this noisy video-caption data, we employ crucial data preprocessing techniques and our unified architecture with strong image pretraining. The resulting trained model is then extended to tackle two distinct downstream tasks in control and generation. Evaluations across robotic manipulation and video generation under language-driven settings establish the cross-domain versatility of FOFPred, confirming the value of a unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Site (Code, Models, Demo): https://fofpred.github.io</p></details> |

Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both 3D human motion and video generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://igl-hkust.github.io/CoMoVi/</p></details> |

While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.</p></details> | 22 pages, 10 figures |

However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

| **[Beyond Inpainting: Unleash 3D Understanding for Precise Camera-Controlled Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10214v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoF-T2I: Video Models as Pure Visual Reasoners for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10061v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation models have revealed the emergence of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning, enabling frame-by-frame visual inference. With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Transition Matching Distillation for Fast Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09881v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large video diffusion and flow models have achieved remarkable success in high-quality video generation, but their use in real-time interactive applications remains limited due to their inefficient multi-step sampling process. In this work, we present Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), a novel framework for distilling video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators. The central idea of TMD is to match the multi-step denoising trajectory of a diffusion model with a few-step probability transition process, where each transition is modeled as a lightweight conditional flow. To enable efficient distillation, we decompose the original diffusion backbone into two components: (1) a main backbone, comprising the majority of early layers, that extracts semantic representations at each outer transition step; and (2) a flow head, consisting of the last few layers, that leverages these representations to perform multiple inner flow updates. Given a pretrained video diffusion model, we first introduce a flow head to the model, and adapt it into a conditional flow map. We then apply distribution matching distillation to the student model with flow head rollout in each transition step. Extensive experiments on distilling Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models demonstrate that TMD provides a flexible and strong trade-off between generation speed and visual quality. In particular, TMD outperforms existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in terms of visual fidelity and prompt adherence.

| **[Efficient Camera-Controlled Video Generation of Static Scenes via Sparse Diffusion and 3D Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09697v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ayushtewari.com/projects/srender/</p></details> |

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |

Although sparse attention methods attempt to address this challenge, existing approaches either rely on oversimplified static patterns or require computationally expensive sampling operations to achieve dynamic sparsity, resulting in inaccurate pattern predictions and degraded generation quality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a \underline{\textbf{M}}ixtrue-\underline{\textbf{O}}f-\underline{\textbf{D}}istribution \textbf{DiT} (\textbf{MOD-DiT}), a novel sampling-free dynamic attention framework that accurately models evolving attention patterns through a two-stage process. First, MOD-DiT leverages prior information from early denoising steps and adopts a {distributed mixing approach} to model an efficient linear approximation model, which is then used to predict mask patterns for a specific denoising interval. Second, an online block masking strategy dynamically applies these predicted masks while maintaining historical sparsity information, eliminating the need for repetitive sampling operations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate consistent acceleration and quality improvements across multiple benchmarks and model architectures, validating MOD-DiT's effectiveness for efficient, high-quality video generation while overcoming the computational limitations of traditional sparse attention approaches.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce VideoAR, the first large-scale Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling. VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger. These results demonstrate that VideoAR narrows the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion paradigms, offering a scalable, efficient, and temporally consistent foundation for future video generation research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ernie-research.github.io/VideoAR/</p></details> |

A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline,\textit{PhyRPR}:\textit{Phy\uline{R}eason}--\textit{Phy\uline{P}lan}--\textit{Phy\uline{R}efine}, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, \textit{PhyReason} uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; \textit{PhyPlan} deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and \textit{PhyRefine} injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.</p></details> |  |

Autoregressive methods address this problem by applying block-wise autoregressive diffusion methods. However, these methods suffer from the problem of error accumulation and quality degradation. To address this, we propose JoyAvatar-Flash, an audio-driven autoregressive model capable of real-time inference and infinite-length video generation with the following contributions: (1) Progressive Step Bootstrapping (PSB), which allocates more denoising steps to initial frames to stabilize generation and reduce error accumulation; (2) Motion Condition Injection (MCI), enhancing temporal coherence by injecting noise-corrupted previous frames as motion condition; and (3) Unbounded RoPE via Cache-Resetting (URCR), enabling infinite-length generation through dynamic positional encoding.

While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve POC@1.0 only about 20% and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning.

Linear attention offers an efficient alternative, but its direct application often degrades performance, with existing fixes typically re-introducing computational overhead through extra modules (e.g., depthwise separable convolution) that defeat the original purpose. In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension. We prove that MHLA maintains linear complexity while recovering much of the expressive power of softmax attention, and verify its effectiveness across multiple domains, achieving a 3.6\% improvement on ImageNet classification, a 6.3\% gain on NLP, a 12.6\% improvement on image generation, and a 41\% enhancement on video generation under the same time complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/DAGroup-PKU/MHLA/ Project website: https://dagroup-pku.github.io/MHLA/</p></details> |

Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the static inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain diffusion timesteps and spatial regions. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT), an architecture that dynamically adjusts its computation along both timestep and spatial dimensions. Building on these designs, we present an extended version, DyDiT++, with improvements in three key aspects. First, it extends the generation mechanism of DyDiT beyond diffusion to flow matching, demonstrating that our method can also accelerate flow-matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT++. Remarkably, with <3% additional fine-tuning iterations, our approach reduces the FLOPs of DiT-XL by 51%, yielding 1.73x realistic speedup on hardware, and achieves a competitive FID score of 2.07 on ImageNet.

We present Motive (MOTIon attribution for Video gEneration), a motion-centric, gradient-based data attribution framework that scales to modern, large, high-quality video datasets and models. We use this to study which fine-tuning clips improve or degrade temporal dynamics. Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model.

Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecast the Principal, Stabilize the Residual: Subspace-Aware Feature Caching for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07396v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models have achieved unprecedented quality in image and video generation, yet their iterative sampling process remains computationally prohibitive. To accelerate inference, feature caching methods have emerged by reusing intermediate representations across timesteps. However, existing caching approaches treat all feature components uniformly. We reveal that DiT feature spaces contain distinct principal and residual subspaces with divergent temporal behavior: the principal subspace evolves smoothly and predictably, while the residual subspace exhibits volatile, low-energy oscillations that resist accurate prediction. Building on this insight, we propose SVD-Cache, a subspace-aware caching framework that decomposes diffusion features via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), applies exponential moving average (EMA) prediction to the dominant low-rank components, and directly reuses the residual subspace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SVD-Cache achieves near-lossless across diverse models and methods, including 5.55$\times$ speedup on FLUX and HunyuanVideo, and compatibility with model acceleration techniques including distillation, quantization and sparse attention.

| **[Perception Test 2025: Challenge Summary and a Unified VQA Extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06287v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Third Perception Test challenge was organised as a full-day workshop alongside the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025. Its primary goal is to benchmark state-of-the-art video models and measure the progress in multimodal perception. This year, the workshop featured 2 guest tracks as well: KiVA (an image understanding challenge) and Physic-IQ (a video generation challenge). In this report, we summarise the results from the main Perception Test challenge, detailing both the existing tasks as well as novel additions to the benchmark. In this iteration, we placed an emphasis on task unification, as this poses a more challenging test for current SOTA multimodal models. The challenge included five consolidated tracks: unified video QA, unified object and point tracking, unified action and sound localisation, grounded video QA, and hour-long video QA, alongside an analysis and interpretability track that is still open for submissions. Notably, the unified video QA track introduced a novel subset that reformulates traditional perception tasks (such as point tracking and temporal action localisation) as multiple-choice video QA questions that video-language models can natively tackle. The unified object and point tracking merged the original object tracking and point tracking tasks, whereas the unified action and sound localisation merged the original temporal action localisation and temporal sound localisation tracks. Accordingly, we required competitors to use unified approaches rather than engineered pipelines with task-specific models. By proposing such a unified challenge, Perception Test 2025 highlights the significant difficulties existing models face when tackling diverse perception tasks through unified interfaces.</p></details> |  |

However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines. We release all datasets, code, model weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and interactive demos at https://goal-force.github.io/</p></details> |

However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, we present RCM (Rotate your Character Model), an advanced image-to-video diffusion framework tailored for high-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) and 3D character generation. Compared to existing diffusion-based approaches, RCM offers several key advantages: (1) transferring characters with any complex poses into a canonical pose, enabling consistent novel view synthesis across the entire viewing orbit, (2) high-resolution orbital video generation at 1024x1024 resolution, (3) controllable observation positions given different initial camera poses, and (4) multi-view conditioning supporting up to 4 input images, accommodating diverse user scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and 3D generation quality.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Subject-driven Video Generation via Disentangled Identity and Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17816v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose to train a subject-driven customized video generation model through decoupling the subject-specific learning from temporal dynamics in zero-shot without additional tuning. A traditional method for video customization that is tuning-free often relies on large, annotated video datasets, which are computationally expensive and require extensive annotation. In contrast to the previous approach, we introduce the use of an image customization dataset directly on training video customization models, factorizing the video customization into two folds: (1) identity injection through image customization dataset and (2) temporal modeling preservation with a small set of unannotated videos through the image-to-video training method. Additionally, we employ random image token dropping with randomized image initialization during image-to-video fine-tuning to mitigate the copy-and-paste issue. To further enhance learning, we introduce stochastic switching during joint optimization of subject-specific and temporal features, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method achieves strong subject consistency and scalability, outperforming existing video customization models in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>[v2 u...</summary><p>[v2 updated] Project Page : https://carpedkm.github.io/projects/disentangled_sub/index.html</p></details> |
| **[Video Generation Models Are Good Latent Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21541v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaussianSwap: Animatable Video Face Swapping with 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05511v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GaussianSwap, a novel video face swapping framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting based face avatar from a target video while transferring identity from a source image to the avatar. Conventional video swapping frameworks are limited to generating facial representations in pixel-based formats. The resulting swapped faces exist merely as a set of unstructured pixels without any capacity for animation or interactive manipulation. Our work introduces a paradigm shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to the creation of high-fidelity avatar with swapped faces. The framework first preprocesses target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses and segmentation masks, and then rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames, enabling dynamic facial control. To ensure identity preserving, we propose an compound identity embedding constructed from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning. Finally, we render the face-swapped avatar on the background frames to obtain the face-swapped video. Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianSwap achieves superior identity preservation, visual clarity and temporal consistency, while enabling previously unattainable interactive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReVision: Refining Video Diffusion with Explicit 3D Motion Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21855v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, video generation has seen significant advancements. However, challenges still persist in generating complex motions and interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce ReVision, a plug-and-play framework that explicitly integrates parameterized 3D model knowledge into a pretrained conditional video generation model, significantly enhancing its ability to generate high-quality videos with complex motion and interactions. Specifically, ReVision consists of three stages. First, a video diffusion model is used to generate a coarse video. Next, we extract a set of 2D and 3D features from the coarse video to construct a 3D object-centric representation, which is then refined by our proposed parameterized motion prior model to produce an accurate 3D motion sequence. Finally, this refined motion sequence is fed back into the same video diffusion model as additional conditioning, enabling the generation of motion-consistent videos, even in scenarios involving complex actions and interactions. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on Stable Video Diffusion, where ReVision significantly improves motion fidelity and coherence. Remarkably, with only 1.5B parameters, it even outperforms a state-of-the-art video generation model with over 13B parameters on complex video generation by a substantial margin. Our results suggest that, by incorporating 3D motion knowledge, even a relatively small video diffusion model can generate complex motions and interactions with greater realism and controllability, offering a promising solution for physically plausible video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR camera-ready version.

| **[RoboVIP: Multi-View Video Generation with Visual Identity Prompting Augments Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05241v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diversity, quantity, and quality of manipulation data are critical for training effective robot policies. However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plenoptic Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05239v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera-controlled generative video re-rendering methods, such as ReCamMaster, have achieved remarkable progress. However, despite their success in single-view setting, these works often struggle to maintain consistency across multi-view scenarios. Ensuring spatio-temporal coherence in hallucinated regions remains challenging due to the inherent stochasticity of generative models. To address it, we introduce PlenopticDreamer, a framework that synchronizes generative hallucinations to maintain spatio-temporal memory. The core idea is to train a multi-in-single-out video-conditioned model in an autoregressive manner, aided by a camera-guided video retrieval strategy that adaptively selects salient videos from previous generations as conditional inputs. In addition, Our training incorporates progressive context-scaling to improve convergence, self-conditioning to enhance robustness against long-range visual degradation caused by error accumulation, and a long-video conditioning mechanism to support extended video generation. Extensive experiments on the Basic and Agibot benchmarks demonstrate that PlenopticDreamer achieves state-of-the-art video re-rendering, delivering superior view synchronization, high-fidelity visuals, accurate camera control, and diverse view transformations (e.g., third-person to third-person, and head-view to gripper-view in robotic manipulation).

Existing mitigation strategies, such as textual filtering or random video perturbations, often fail to address the root cause: over-reliance on language priors rather than fine-grained visual dynamics. We propose a scalable framework for counterfactual video generation that synthesizes videos differing only in actions or temporal structure while preserving scene context. Our pipeline combines multimodal LLMs for action proposal and editing guidance with diffusion-based image and video models to generate semantic hard negatives at scale. Using this framework, we build CounterVid, a synthetic dataset of ~26k preference pairs targeting action recognition and temporal reasoning. We further introduce MixDPO, a unified Direct Preference Optimization approach that jointly leverages textual and visual preferences. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL with MixDPO yields consistent improvements, notably in temporal ordering, and transfers effectively to standard video hallucination benchmarks. Code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[MM-Sonate: Multimodal Controllable Audio-Video Generation with Zero-Shot Voice Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01568v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint audio-video generation aims to synthesize synchronized multisensory content, yet current unified models struggle with fine-grained acoustic control, particularly for identity-preserving speech. Existing approaches either suffer from temporal misalignment due to cascaded generation or lack the capability to perform zero-shot voice cloning within a joint synthesis framework. In this work, we present MM-Sonate, a multimodal flow-matching framework that unifies controllable audio-video joint generation with zero-shot voice cloning capabilities. Unlike prior works that rely on coarse semantic descriptions, MM-Sonate utilizes a unified instruction-phoneme input to enforce strict linguistic and temporal alignment. To enable zero-shot voice cloning, we introduce a timbre injection mechanism that effectively decouples speaker identity from linguistic content. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of standard classifier-free guidance in multimodal settings, we propose a noise-based negative conditioning strategy that utilizes natural noise priors to significantly enhance acoustic fidelity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MM-Sonate establishes new state-of-the-art performance in joint generation benchmarks, significantly outperforming baselines in lip synchronization and speech intelligibility, while achieving voice cloning fidelity comparable to specialized Text-to-Speech systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Generative Details: Direct Localized Detail Preference Optimization for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04068v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[PackCache: A Training-Free Acceleration Method for Unified Autoregressive Video Generation via Compact KV-Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04359v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified autoregressive model is a Transformer-based framework that addresses diverse multimodal tasks (e.g., text, image, video) as a single sequence modeling problem under a shared token space. Such models rely on the KV-cache mechanism to reduce attention computation from O(T^2) to O(T); however, KV-cache size grows linearly with the number of generated tokens, and it rapidly becomes the dominant bottleneck limiting inference efficiency and generative length. Unified autoregressive video generation inherits this limitation. Our analysis reveals that KV-cache tokens exhibit distinct spatiotemporal properties: (i) text and conditioning-image tokens act as persistent semantic anchors that consistently receive high attention, and (ii) attention to previous frames naturally decays with temporal distance. Leveraging these observations, we introduce PackCache, a training-free KV-cache management method that dynamically compacts the KV cache through three coordinated mechanisms: condition anchoring that preserves semantic references, cross-frame decay modeling that allocates cache budget according to temporal distance, and spatially preserving position embedding that maintains coherent 3D structure under cache removal. In terms of efficiency, PackCache accelerates end-to-end generation by 1.7-2.2x on 48-frame long sequences, showcasing its strong potential for enabling longer-sequence video generation. Notably, the final four frames - the portion most impacted by the progressively expanding KV-cache and thus the most expensive segment of the clip - PackCache delivers a 2.6x and 3.7x acceleration on A40 and H200, respectively, for 48-frame videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReHyAt: Recurrent Hybrid Attention for Video Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04342v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models have shifted towards transformer-based architectures, achieving state-of-the-art video generation but at the cost of quadratic attention complexity, which severely limits scalability for longer sequences. We introduce ReHyAt, a Recurrent Hybrid Attention mechanism that combines the fidelity of softmax attention with the efficiency of linear attention, enabling chunk-wise recurrent reformulation and constant memory usage. Unlike the concurrent linear-only SANA Video, ReHyAt's hybrid design allows efficient distillation from existing softmax-based models, reducing the training cost by two orders of magnitude to ~160 GPU hours, while being competitive in the quality. Our light-weight distillation and finetuning pipeline provides a recipe that can be applied to future state-of-the-art bidirectional softmax-based models. Experiments on VBench and VBench-2.0, as well as a human preference study, demonstrate that ReHyAt achieves state-of-the-art video quality while reducing attention cost from quadratic to linear, unlocking practical scalability for long-duration and on-device video generation.

| **[Choreographing a World of Dynamic Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04194v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic objects in our physical 4D (3D + time) world are constantly evolving, deforming, and interacting with other objects, leading to diverse 4D scene dynamics. In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design preserves the MLLM's original text generation capabilities, enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions, and maintains visual consistency in the generated content. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as changing the environment or altering materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we released our model and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website https://congwei1230.github.io/UniVideo/</p></details> |

In this work, we propose PhysVideoGenerator, a proof-of-concept framework that explicitly embeds a learnable physics prior into the video generation process. We introduce a lightweight predictor network, PredictorP, which regresses high-level physical features extracted from a pre-trained Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA 2) directly from noisy diffusion latents. These predicted physics tokens are injected into the temporal attention layers of a DiT-based generator (Latte) via a dedicated cross-attention mechanism. Our primary contribution is demonstrating the technical feasibility of this joint training paradigm: we show that diffusion latents contain sufficient information to recover V-JEPA 2 physical representations, and that multi-task optimization remains stable over training. This report documents the architectural design, technical challenges, and validation of training stability, establishing a foundation for future large-scale evaluation of physics-aware generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, project page: https://github.com/CVFall2025-Project/PhysVideoGenerator</p></details> |

Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hit-perfect.github.io/VideoMemory/</p></details> |

We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements. In our evaluations, the model achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, while delivering results comparable to proprietary models at a fraction of their computational cost and inference time. All model weights and code are publicly released.</p></details> |  |

However, their inherently multiple step inference process imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering real-world deployment. Accelerating diffusion models is therefore essential, yet determining how to combine multiple model acceleration techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a framework driven by large language models (LLMs) for automated acceleration code generation and evaluation. First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements. We provide a detailed explanation of the DiffBench construction and the design principles underlying DiffAgent.

In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a framework for unified detection and explanation of synthetic image and video, with a direct reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a unified benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability.

Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DreamStyle is competent in all three video stylization tasks, and outperforms the competitors in style consistency and video quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Page: https://lemonsky1995.github.io/dreamstyle/</p></details> |

We present RoboTransfer, a diffusion-based video generation framework for synthesizing robotic data. By leveraging cross-view feature interactions and globally consistent 3D geometry, RoboTransfer ensures multi-view geometric consistency while enabling fine-grained control over scene elements, such as background editing and object replacement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboTransfer produces videos with superior geometric consistency and visual fidelity.

| **[Compositional Diffusion with Guided Search for Long-Horizon Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00126v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have emerged as powerful tools for planning, with compositional approaches offering particular promise for modeling long-horizon task distributions by composing together local, modular generative models. This compositional paradigm spans diverse domains, from multi-step manipulation planning to panoramic image synthesis to long video generation. However, compositional generative models face a critical challenge: when local distributions are multimodal, existing composition methods average incompatible modes, producing plans that are neither locally feasible nor globally coherent. We propose Compositional Diffusion with Guided Search (CDGS), which addresses this mode averaging problem by embedding search directly within the diffusion denoising process. Our method explores diverse combinations of local modes through population-based sampling, prunes infeasible candidates using likelihood-based filtering, and enforces global consistency through iterative resampling between overlapping segments. CDGS matches oracle performance on seven robot manipulation tasks, outperforming baselines that lack compositionality or require long-horizon training data. The approach generalizes across domains, enabling coherent text-guided panoramic images and long videos through effective local-to-global message passing.

By leveraging a unified vision representation within a unified autoregressive architecture, NextFlow natively activates multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, unlocking abilities of image editing, interleaved content and video generation. Motivated by the distinct nature of modalities - where text is strictly sequential and images are inherently hierarchical - we retain next-token prediction for text but adopt next-scale prediction for visual generation. This departs from traditional raster-scan methods, enabling the generation of 1024x1024 images in just 5 seconds - orders of magnitude faster than comparable AR models. We address the instabilities of multi-scale generation through a robust training recipe. Furthermore, we introduce a prefix-tuning strategy for reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that NextFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance among unified models and rivals specialized diffusion baselines in visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/ByteVisionLab/NextFlow</p></details> |

However, existing robotic face driving research primarily focuses on conversations or mimicking static expressions, struggling to meet the high demands for continuous emotional expression and coherence in singing. To address this, we propose a novel avatar-driven framework for appealing robotic singing. We first leverage portrait video generation models embedded with extensive human priors to synthesize vivid singing avatars, providing reliable expression and emotion guidance. Subsequently, these facial features are transferred to the robot via semantic-oriented mapping functions that span a wide expression space. Furthermore, to quantitatively evaluate the emotional richness of robotic singing, we propose the Emotion Dynamic Range metric to measure the emotional breadth within the Valence-Arousal space, revealing that a broad emotional spectrum is crucial for appealing performances. Comprehensive experiments prove that our method achieves rich emotional expressions while maintaining lip-audio synchronization, significantly outperforming existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, to our knowledge, the domain of two-person interactions, particularly in the context of martial arts combat, remains uncharted. We identify a significant gap: existing models for single-person dancing generation prove insufficient for capturing the subtleties and complexities of two engaged fighters, resulting in challenges such as identity confusion, anomalous limbs, and action mismatches. To address this, we introduce a pioneering new task, Personalized Martial Arts Combat Video Generation. Our approach, MagicFight, is specifically crafted to overcome these hurdles. Given this pioneering task, we face a lack of appropriate datasets. Thus, we generate a bespoke dataset using the game physics engine Unity, meticulously crafting a multitude of 3D characters, martial arts moves, and scenes designed to represent the diversity of combat. MagicFight refines and adapts existing models and strategies to generate high-fidelity two-person combat videos that maintain individual identities and ensure seamless, coherent action sequences, thereby laying the groundwork for future innovations in the realm of interactive video content creation.

Though reinforcement learning from human feedback offers promise for preference alignment, existing reward models for visual generation face limitations, including black-box scoring without interpretability and potentially resultant unexpected biases. We present VisionReward, a general framework for learning human visual preferences in both image and video generation. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical visual assessment framework to capture fine-grained human preferences, and leverages linear weighting to enable interpretable preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-dimensional consistent strategy when using VisionReward as a reward model during preference optimization for visual generation. Experiments show that VisionReward can significantly outperform existing image and video reward models on both machine metrics and human evaluation. Notably, VisionReward surpasses VideoScore by 17.2% in preference prediction accuracy, and text-to-video models with VisionReward achieve a 31.6% higher pairwise win rate compared to the same models using VideoScore.

In autonomous driving, this vision gives rise to driving world models: generative simulators that imagine ego and agent futures, enabling scalable simulation, safe testing of corner cases, and rich synthetic data generation. Yet, despite fast-growing research activity, the field lacks a rigorous benchmark to measure progress and guide priorities. Existing evaluations remain limited: generic video metrics overlook safety-critical imaging factors; trajectory plausibility is rarely quantified; temporal and agent-level consistency is neglected; and controllability with respect to ego conditioning is ignored. Moreover, current datasets fail to cover the diversity of conditions required for real-world deployment. To address these gaps, we present DrivingGen, the first comprehensive benchmark for generative driving world models. DrivingGen combines a diverse evaluation dataset curated from both driving datasets and internet-scale video sources, spanning varied weather, time of day, geographic regions, and complex maneuvers, with a suite of new metrics that jointly assess visual realism, trajectory plausibility, temporal coherence, and controllability. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art models reveals clear trade-offs: general models look better but break physics, while driving-specific ones capture motion realistically but lag in visual quality. DrivingGen offers a unified evaluation framework to foster reliable, controllable, and deployable driving world models, enabling scalable simulation, planning, and data-driven decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures; Project Website: https://drivinggen-bench.github.io/</p></details> |

In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance.</p></details> |  |

Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation. Extensive experiments on challenging scenes show improved generalization and generation quality over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for accessible and efficient 3D scene construction.</p></details> |  |

Industrial defect segmentation, for instance, requires highly accurate labels, yet acquiring such data is costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion-based pipeline for generating high-fidelity industrial datasets with minimal supervision. Our approach conditions the diffusion model on enriched bounding box representations to produce precise segmentation masks, ensuring realistic and accurately localized defect synthesis. Compared to existing layout-conditioned generative methods, our approach improves defect consistency and spatial accuracy. We introduce two quantitative metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our method and assess its impact on a downstream segmentation task trained on real and synthetic data. Our results demonstrate that diffusion-based synthesis can bridge the gap between artificial and real-world industrial data, fostering more reliable and cost-efficient segmentation models. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/covisionlab/diffusion_labeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Synthetic Data for Computer Vision Workshop - CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%. Code and models will be released on our project page.</p></details> |  |

Our network architecture is based on lattice gauge equivariant convolutional neural networks (L-CNNs), which respect local and global symmetries on the lattice. Models are trained on a single ensemble generated using a traditional Monte Carlo method. By studying Wilson loops of various size as well as the topological susceptibility, we find that the diffusion approach generalizes remarkably well to larger inverse couplings and lattice sizes with negligible loss of accuracy while retaining moderately high acceptance rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns about copyright infringement and the misuse of generated content. Watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution, enabling copyright identification and misuse tracing through imperceptible markers embedded in generated images. Among these, latent-based watermarking techniques are particularly promising, as they embed watermarks directly into the latent noise without altering the underlying LDM architecture. In this work, we demonstrate that such latent-based watermarks are practically vulnerable to detection and compromise through systematic analysis of output images' statistical patterns for the first time. To counter this, we propose SWA-LDM (Stealthy Watermark for LDM), a lightweight framework that enhances stealth by dynamically randomizing the embedded watermarks using the Gaussian-distributed latent noise inherent to diffusion models. By embedding unique, pattern-free signatures per image, SWA-LDM eliminates detectable artifacts while preserving image quality and extraction robustness. Experiments demonstrate an average of 20% improvement in stealth over state-of-the-art methods, enabling secure deployment of watermarked generative AI in real-world applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Masked Diffusion Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19501v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation (GR) typically first quantizes continuous item embeddings into multi-level semantic IDs (SIDs), and then generates the next item via autoregressive decoding. Although existing methods are already competitive in terms of recommendation performance, directly inheriting the autoregressive decoding paradigm from language models still suffers from three key limitations: (1) autoregressive decoding struggles to jointly capture global dependencies among the multi-dimensional features associated with different positions of SID; (2) using a unified, fixed decoding path for the same item implicitly assumes that all users attend to item attributes in the same order; (3) autoregressive decoding is inefficient at inference time and struggles to meet real-time requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose MDGR, a Masked Diffusion Generative Recommendation framework that reshapes the GR pipeline from three perspectives: codebook, training, and inference. (1) We adopt a parallel codebook to provide a structural foundation for diffusion-based GR. (2) During training, we adaptively construct masking supervision signals along both the temporal and sample dimensions. (3) During inference, we develop a warm-up-based two-stage parallel decoding strategy for efficient generation of SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and industrial-scale datasets show that MDGR outperforms ten state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.78%. Furthermore, by deploying MDGR on a large-scale online advertising platform, we achieve a 1.20% increase in revenue, demonstrating its practical value. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cortex-Grounded Diffusion Models for Brain Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19498v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic neuroimaging data can mitigate critical limitations of real-world datasets, including the scarcity of rare phenotypes, domain shifts across scanners, and insufficient longitudinal coverage. However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.</p></details> | preprint |

Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, transferring images to their approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image areas (e.g., plain sky). Through a series of analyses, we trace this issue to the first inversion steps, which fail to provide accurate and diverse noise. Consequently, the DDIM inversion space is notably less manipulative than the original noise. We show that prior inversion methods do not fully resolve this issue, but our simple fix, where we replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, successfully decorrelates latent encodings and enables higher quality editions and interpolations. The code is available at https://github.com/luk-st/taba.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 p....</summary><p>35 p., 16 figs.

We introduce universal MDT (UMDT), a generalization of MDT that seeks to translate between any pair of $K$ domains using only $K-1$ paired datasets with a central domain. To tackle this problem, we propose Diffusion Router (DR), a unified diffusion-based framework that models all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations with a single noise predictor conditioned on the source and target domain labels. DR enables indirect non-central translations by routing through the central domain. We further introduce a novel scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound objective and an efficient Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct non-central mappings. Through evaluation on three large-scale UMDT benchmarks, DR achieves state-of-the-art results for both indirect and direct translations, while lowering sampling cost and unlocking novel tasks such as sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. These results establish DR as a scalable and versatile framework for universal translation across multiple domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, most existing methods still primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled. We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while significantly improving generation efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

While recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing novel views from limited inputs, their outputs often suffer from visual artifacts and lack 3D consistency, posing challenges for reliable mesh optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages diffusion models to enhance sparse-view mesh reconstruction in a principled and reliable manner. To address the instability of diffusion outputs, we propose a Consensus Diffusion Module that filters unreliable generations via interquartile range (IQR) analysis and performs variance-aware image fusion to produce robust pseudo-supervision. Building on this, we design an online reinforcement learning strategy based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to adaptively select the most informative viewpoints for enhancement, guided by diffusion loss. Finally, the fused images are used to jointly supervise a NeRF-based model alongside sparse-view ground truth, ensuring consistency across both geometry and appearance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in both geometric quality and rendering quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>needs...</summary><p>needs to be revised and updated</p></details> |

They have demonstrated impressive results in replicating dense, real-world contents such as images, musical pieces, or human languages. This work investigates their application to the numerical simulation of incompressible fluid flows, with a view toward incorporating physical constraints such as incompressibility in the probabilistic forecasting framework enabled by generative networks. For that purpose, we explore different conditional, score-based diffusion models where the divergence-free constraint is imposed by the Leray spectral projector, and autoregressive conditioning is aimed at stabilizing the forecasted flow snapshots at distant time horizons. The proposed models are run on a benchmark turbulence problem, namely a Kolmogorov flow, which allows for a fairly detailed analytical and numerical treatment and thus simplifies the evaluation of the numerical methods used to simulate it. Numerical experiments of increasing complexity are performed in order to compare the advantages and limitations of the diffusion models we have implemented and appraise their performances, including: (i) in-distribution assessment over the same time horizons and for similar physical conditions as the ones seen during training; (ii) rollout predictions over time horizons unseen during training; and (iii) out-of-distribution tests for forecasting flows markedly different from those seen during training. In particular, these results illustrate the ability of diffusion models to reproduce the main statistical characteristics of Kolmogorov turbulence in scenarios departing from the ones they were trained on.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes an autoregressive divergence-free diffusion model for 2D Kolmogorov fluid flow forecasting</p></details> |

These variations are often masked by the inherent cellular heterogeneity, making it challenging to distinguish differences between experimental conditions. Recent advancements in deep generative models have demonstrated significant potential for revealing these nuanced phenotypes through image translation, opening new frontiers in cellular and molecular biology as well as the identification of novel biomarkers. Among these generative models, diffusion models stand out for their ability to produce high-quality, realistic images. However, training diffusion models typically requires large datasets and substantial computational resources, both of which can be limited in biological research. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages pre-trained latent diffusion models to uncover subtle phenotypic changes. We validate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on several small datasets of microscopy images. Our findings reveal that our approach enables effective detection of phenotypic variations, capturing both visually apparent and imperceptible differences. Ultimately, our results highlight the promising potential of this approach for phenotype detection, especially in contexts constrained by limited data and computational capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to CVPR CVDD 2025</p></details> |

Consequently, segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information). However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning, which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement (IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results from diverse discriminative architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)</p></details> |

However, their computational demands, particularly the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms and multi-step inference processes, present substantial bottlenecks that limit their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose TokenCache, a novel acceleration method that leverages the token-based multi-block architecture of transformers to reduce redundant computations. TokenCache tackles three critical questions: (1) Which tokens should be pruned and reused by the caching mechanism to eliminate redundancy? (2) Which blocks should be targeted for efficient caching? (3) At which time steps should caching be applied to balance speed and quality? In response to these challenges, TokenCache introduces a Cache Predictor that hierarchically addresses these issues by (1) Token pruning: assigning importance scores to each token to determine which tokens to prune and reuse; (2) Block selection: allocating pruning ratio to each block to adaptively select blocks for caching; (3) Temporal Scheduling: deciding at which time steps to apply caching strategies. Experimental results across various models demonstrate that TokenCache achieves an effective trade-off between generation quality and inference speed for diffusion transformers.</p></details> |  |

Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks.

| **[Smoothing the Score Function for Generalization in Diffusion Models: An Optimization-based Explanation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19285v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models achieve remarkable generation quality, yet face a fundamental challenge known as memorization, where generated samples can replicate training samples exactly. We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization. Experiments across multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving generalization while maintaining high generation quality.</p></details> | 61pages,32 figures |

However, existing widely adopted model-based draft designs, such as EAGLE3, improve accuracy at the cost of multi-step autoregressive inference, resulting in high drafting latency and ultimately rendering the drafting stage itself a performance bottleneck. Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves a 2.03x--3.44x wall-clock time speedup across multiple datasets, surpassing EAGLE3 by 30% on average and offering a practical speculative decoding framework. Code is released at https://github.com/fvliang/DART.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-based RNA Design by Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19232v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages (7 pages content + 2 pages references + 11 pages appendix), 11 figures, 8 tables.

However, there is a significant lack of research into their internal state as an editable knowledge representation. To fill this gap, we first explore the representational properties of the RWKV state by proposing the DREAMSTATE framework. This framework utilizes a conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to directly model the probability manifold of the state, enabling its generation and editing. The structural nature of this representation is validated through t-SNE visualizations and controlled generation experiments. After successfully uncovering and modeling the state's representational potential, we further propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the local advantages of RNNs with global context adaptability. This architecture features a parallel DiT that processes a variable-length global context to dynamically generate and adjust the core recurrent module's WKV parameters, transforming the fixed recurrence mechanism into a context-aware dynamic function. Experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model can be trained stably via a multi-objective loss, validating its design feasibility. Our work not only opens a new research direction for RNN state representation but also provides a concrete architectural reference for future model design. The code is publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/2dgx41s/DreamState.</p></details> |  |

While recent works have accelerated inference via KV cache reuse or heuristic decoding, they overlook the intrinsic inefficiencies within the block-wise diffusion process. Specifically, they suffer from spatial redundancy by modeling informative-sparse suffix regions uniformly and temporal inefficiency by applying fixed denoising schedules across all the decoding process. To address this, we propose Streaming-dLLM, a training-free framework that streamlines inference across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatially, we introduce attenuation guided suffix modeling to approximate the full context by pruning redundant mask tokens. Temporally, we employ a dynamic confidence aware strategy with an early exit mechanism, allowing the model to skip unnecessary iterations for converged tokens. Extensive experiments show that Streaming-dLLM achieves up to 68.2X speedup while maintaining generation quality, highlighting its effectiveness in diffusion decoding.

We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of FBSDiff++ in I2I translation visual quality, efficiency, versatility, and controllability compared to related advanced approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Memorization: Selective Learning for Copyright-Safe Diffusion Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11194v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memorization in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models poses significant security and intellectual property risks, enabling adversarial attribute extraction and the unauthorized reproduction of sensitive or proprietary features. While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective learning at the concept level. We introduce a gradient projection method designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework drastically reduces memorization while rigorously preserving generation quality and semantic fidelity. By reframing memorization control as selective learning, our approach establishes a new paradigm for IP-safe and privacy-preserving generative AI.</p></details> |  |

We employ time-dependent preconditioning of network inputs and outputs to stabilize training and explore two skip-connection configurations that allow the network to predict either environmental noise or clean speech. To control activation and weight magnitudes, we adopt a magnitude-preserving architecture and learn the contribution of the noisy input within each network block for improved conditioning. We further analyze the impact of exponential moving average (EMA) parameter smoothing by approximating different EMA profiles post training, finding that, unlike in image generation, short or absent EMA consistently yields better speech enhancement performance. Experiments on VoiceBank-DEMAND and EARS-WHAM demonstrate competitive signal-to-distortion ratios and perceptual scores, with the two skip-connection variants exhibiting complementary strengths. These findings provide new insights into EMA behavior, magnitude preservation, and skip-connection design for diffusion-based speech enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct. It substantially outperforms classical SMC perturbations and RL-based methods under misalignment, and we provide theoretical guarantees that DEPF resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Diffusion for Universal Hand-Object Grasp Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04560v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting and generating human hand grasp over objects is critical for animation and robotic tasks. In this work, we focus on generating both the hand and objects in a grasp by a single diffusion model. Our proposed Joint Hand-Object Diffusion (JHOD) models the hand and object in a unified latent representation. It uses the hand-object grasping data to learn to accommodate hand and object to form plausible grasps. Also, to enforce the generalizability over diverse object shapes, it leverages large-scale object datasets to learn an inclusive object latent embedding. With or without a given object as an optional condition, the diffusion model can generate grasps unconditionally or conditional to the object. Compared to the usual practice of learning object-conditioned grasp generation from only hand-object grasp data, our method benefits from more diverse object data used for training to handle grasp generation more universally. According to both qualitative and quantitative experiments, both conditional and unconditional generation of hand grasp achieves good visual plausibility and diversity. With the extra inclusiveness of object representation learned from large-scale object datasets, the proposed method generalizes well to unseen object shapes.</p></details> | accepted by TMLR |

Existing methods based on latent representations or global diffusion often fail to produce reliable estimates, and may propagate errors across the graph. We propose FSD-CAP, a two-stage framework designed to improve imputation quality under extreme sparsity. In the first stage, a graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion localizes the diffusion process. A fractional diffusion operator adjusts propagation sharpness based on local structure. In the second stage, imputed features are refined using class-aware propagation, which incorporates pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to promote consistency. We evaluated FSD-CAP on multiple datasets. With $99.5\%$ of features missing across five benchmark datasets, FSD-CAP achieves average accuracies of $80.06\%$ (structural) and $81.01\%$ (uniform) in node classification, close to the $81.31\%$ achieved by a standard GCN with full features. For link prediction under the same setting, it reaches AUC scores of $91.65\%$ (structural) and $92.41\%$ (uniform), compared to $95.06\%$ for the fully observed case. Furthermore, FSD-CAP demonstrates superior performance on both large-scale and heterophily datasets when compared to other models.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |

In particular, diffusion methods have enabled new approaches to data compression, where realistic reconstructions can be generated at extremely low bit-rates. This article provides a unifying review of recent diffusion-based methods for generative lossy compression, with a focus on image compression. These methods generally encode the source into an embedding and employ a diffusion model to iteratively refine it in the decoding procedure, such that the final reconstruction approximately follows the ground truth data distribution. The embedding can take various forms and is typically transmitted via an auxiliary entropy model, and recent methods also explore the use of diffusion models themselves for information transmission via channel simulation. We review representative approaches through the lens of rate-distortion-perception theory, highlighting the role of common randomness and connections to inverse problems, and identify open challenges.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Avoid Catastrophic Forgetting with Rank-1 Fisher from Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23593v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation (EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1 variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular, forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is more than halved on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks, while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

Recent diffusion models have advanced SBDD by capturing the distributions of atomic positions and types, yet they often underemphasize binding affinity control during generation. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{\textnormal{\textbf{BADGER}}}, a general \textbf{binding-affinity guidance framework for diffusion models in SBDD}. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} }incorporates binding affinity awareness through two complementary strategies: (1) \textit{classifier guidance}, which applies gradient-based affinity signals during sampling in a plug-and-play fashion, and (2) \textit{classifier-free guidance}, which integrates affinity conditioning directly into diffusion model training. Together, these approaches enable controllable ligand generation guided by binding affinity. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} } can be added to any diffusion model and achieves up to a \textbf{60\% improvement in ligand--protein binding affinity} of sampled molecules over prior methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework to \textbf{multi-constraint diffusion guidance}, jointly optimizing for binding affinity, drug-likeness (QED), and synthetic accessibility (SA) to design realistic and synthesizable drug candidates.</p></details> |  |

Recent feature caching methods accelerate inference via temporal extrapolation, yet can suffer quality degradation from inaccurate modeling of the complex dynamics of feature evolution. We propose HiCache (Hermite Polynomial-based Feature Cache), a training-free acceleration framework that improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature-derivative approximations in diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials as a potentially optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy, and is also effective when applied standalone or integrated with TaylorSeer. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority, achieving 5.55x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while matching or exceeding baseline quality, and maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Moreover, HiCache can be naturally added to previous caching methods to enhance their performance, e.g., improving ClusCa from 0.9480 to 0.9840 in terms of image rewards.

However, existing approaches necessitate to either introduce an off-the-shelf external representation task or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained external representation encoder to provide representation guidance during the training process. In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without requiring external representation components. We propose SelfRepresentation Alignment (SRA), a simple yet effective method that obtains representation guidance using the internal representations of learned diffusion transformer. SRA aligns the latent representation of the diffusion transformer in the earlier layer conditioned on higher noise to that in the later layer conditioned on lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during only the training process. Experimental results indicate that applying SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements, and largely outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary representation task. Our approach achieves performance comparable to methods that are dependent on an external pre-trained representation encoder, which demonstrates the feasibility of acceleration with representation alignment in diffusion transformers themselves.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026.

Uniform and hand-crafted grids can be suboptimal given a budget on the number of time steps. We introduce Adaptive Reparameterized Time (ART) that controls the clock speed of a reparameterized time variable, leading to a time change and uneven timesteps along the sampling trajectory while preserving the terminal time. The objective is to minimize the aggregate error arising from the discretized Euler scheme. We derive a randomized control companion, ART-RL, and formulate time change as a continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) problem with Gaussian policies. We then prove that solving ART-RL recovers the optimal ART schedule, which in turn enables practical actor--critic updates to learn the latter in a data-driven way. Empirically, based on the official EDM pipeline, ART-RL improves Fréchet Inception Distance on CIFAR-10 over a wide range of budgets and transfers to AFHQv2, FFHQ, and ImageNet without the need of retraining.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) dependence on computation-heavy and inflexible calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) Bounded-init Grid Refinement (BGR) and (2) Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization error reduction, as well as (3) $δ$-Guided Bit Switching ($δ$-GBS) for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately 2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on advanced DiT models while maintaining visual fidelity.

Standard diffusion approaches often rely on a single, global linear transfer between domains. We find that this shortcut forces the sampler to traverse off-manifold, high-cost regions, inflating the correction burden and inviting semantic drift. We refer to this shared failure mode as fixed-schedule domain transfer. In this paper, we embed domain-shift dynamics directly into the generative process. Our model predicts a spatially varying mixing field at every reverse step and injects an explicit, target-consistent restoration term into the drift. This in-step guidance keeps large updates on-manifold and shifts the model's role from global alignment to local residual correction. We provide a continuous-time formulation with an exact solution form and derive a practical first-order sampler that preserves marginal consistency. Empirically, across translation tasks in medical imaging, remote sensing, and electroluminescence semantic mapping, our framework improves structural fidelity and semantic consistency while converging in fewer denoising steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

We present a conditional diffusion framework that learns a probabilistic mapping from noisy body surface signals to heart surface electric potentials. The proposed approach leverages the generative nature of diffusion models to capture the non-unique and underdetermined nature of the ECGI inverse problem, enabling probabilistic sampling of multiple reconstructions rather than a single deterministic estimate. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed framework is geometry-free and purely data-driven, alleviating the need for patient-specific mesh construction. We evaluate the method on a real ECGI dataset and compare it against strong deterministic baselines, including a convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network, and transformer-based model. The results demonstrate that the proposed diffusion approach achieves improved reconstruction accuracy, highlighting the potential of diffusion models as a robust tool for noninvasive cardiac electrophysiology imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Discrimination for Medical Image Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18556v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In biomedical engineering, artificial intelligence has become a pivotal tool for enhancing medical diagnostics, particularly in medical image classification tasks such as detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays and breast cancer screening. However, real-world medical datasets frequently exhibit severe class imbalance, where positive samples substantially outnumber negative samples, leading to biased models with low recall rates for minority classes. This imbalance not only compromises diagnostic accuracy but also poses clinical misdiagnosis risks. To address this challenge, we propose SDA-QEC (Simplified Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Classification), an innovative framework that integrates simplified diffusion-based data augmentation with quantum-enhanced feature discrimination. Our approach employs a lightweight diffusion augmentor to generate high-quality synthetic samples for minority classes, rebalancing the training distribution. Subsequently, a quantum feature layer embedded within MobileNetV2 architecture enhances the model's discriminative capability through high-dimensional feature mapping in Hilbert space. Comprehensive experiments on coronary angiography image classification demonstrate that SDA-QEC achieves 98.33% accuracy, 98.78% AUC, and 98.33% F1-score, significantly outperforming classical baselines including ResNet18, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and VGG16. Notably, our framework simultaneously attains 98.33% sensitivity and 98.33% specificity, achieving a balanced performance critical for clinical deployment. The proposed method validates the feasibility of integrating generative augmentation with quantum-enhanced modeling in real-world medical imaging tasks, offering a novel research pathway for developing highly reliable medical AI systems in small-sample, highly imbalanced, and high-risk diagnostic scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Aided Bandwidth-Efficient Semantic Communication with Adaptive Requests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26442v4)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication focuses on conveying the task-relevant meaning rather than exact bitwise recovery. For image transmission with a generative receiver, relying only on text descriptions can be insufficient to preserve instance-specific visual evidence, whereas sending dense latent representations can incur substantial overhead. This paper presents a receiver-driven closed-loop scheme that transmits a short caption together with an initial sparse subset of latent blocks, and then uses feedback to request additional blocks only when needed. At each round, the receiver reconstructs the image via latent diffusion inpainting and applies a semantic consistency check between a caption generated from the reconstruction and the received caption, using a lightweight language similarity score such as ROUGE-L. The receiver stops early once a target consistency level is met, and otherwise requests a small number of additional latent blocks to refine the reconstruction. Experiments on Flickr30k over AWGN channels demonstrate a controllable rate-quality tradeoff. Adaptive feedback achieves the strongest semantic alignment and the lowest failure rate, outperforming budget-matched one-shot transmission while typically using fewer latent blocks than always-on retransmission.</p></details> |  |
| **[BADiff: Bandwidth Adaptive Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21366v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios, limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments.

| **[Diffusion-based Frameworks for Unsupervised Speech Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09931v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses unsupervised diffusion-based single-channel speech enhancement (SE). Prior work in this direction combines a score-based diffusion model trained on clean speech with a Gaussian noise model whose covariance is structured by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). This combination is used within an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) scheme, in which a diffusion-based posterior-sampling E-step estimates the clean speech. We first revisit this framework and propose to explicitly model both speech and acoustic noise as latent variables, jointly sampling them in the E-step instead of sampling speech alone as in previous approaches. We then introduce a new unsupervised SE framework that replaces the NMF noise prior with a diffusion-based noise model, learned jointly with the speech prior in a single conditional score model. Within this framework, we derive two variants: one that implicitly accounts for noise and one that explicitly treats noise as a latent variable. Experiments on WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND show that explicit noise modeling systematically improves SE performance for both NMF-based and diffusion-based noise priors. Under matched conditions, the diffusion-based noise model attains the best overall quality and intelligibility among unsupervised methods, while under mismatched conditions the proposed NMF-based explicit-noise framework is more robust and suffers less degradation than several supervised baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Flexibility Trap: Why Arbitrary Order Limits Reasoning Potential in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15165v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) break the rigid left-to-right constraint of traditional LLMs, enabling token generation in arbitrary orders. Intuitively, this flexibility implies a solution space that strictly supersets the fixed autoregressive trajectory, theoretically unlocking superior reasoning potential for general tasks like mathematics and coding. Consequently, numerous works have leveraged reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit the reasoning capability of dLLMs. In this paper, we reveal a counter-intuitive reality: arbitrary order generation, in its current form, narrows rather than expands the reasoning boundary of dLLMs. We find that dLLMs tend to exploit this order flexibility to bypass high-uncertainty tokens that are crucial for exploration, leading to a premature collapse of the solution space. This observation motivates a rethink of RL approaches for dLLMs, where considerable complexities, such as handling combinatorial trajectories and intractable likelihoods, are often devoted to preserving this flexibility. We demonstrate that effective reasoning can be better elicited by intentionally forgoing arbitrary order and applying standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) instead. Our approach, JustGRPO, is minimalist yet surprisingly effective (e.g., 89.1% accuracy on GSM8K) while fully retaining the parallel decoding ability of dLLMs. Project page: https://nzl-thu.github.io/the-flexibility-trap</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and pre-trained models: https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/JustGRPO</p></details> |

Accurate and robust 2D-3D vessel registration is essential to guide microcatheter and instruments during TACE, enabling precise localization of vascular structures and optimal therapeutic targeting. To tackle this issue, we develop a coarse-to-fine registration strategy. First, we introduce a global alignment module, structure-aware perspective n-point (SA-PnP), to establish correspondence between 2D and 3D vessel structures. Second, we propose TempDiffReg, a temporal diffusion model that performs vessel deformation iteratively by leveraging temporal context to capture complex anatomical variations and local structural changes. We collected data from 23 patients and constructed 626 paired multi-frame samples for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both accuracy and anatomical plausibility. Specifically, our method achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.63 mm and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.51 mm in registration accuracy, representing 66.7\% lower MSE and 17.7\% lower MAE compared to the most competitive existing approaches. It has the potential to assist less-experienced clinicians in safely and efficiently performing complex TACE procedures, ultimately enhancing both surgical outcomes and patient care.

| **[Localizing Knowledge in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18832v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how knowledge is distributed across the layers of generative models is crucial for improving interpretability, controllability, and adaptation. While prior work has explored knowledge localization in UNet-based architectures, Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based models remain underexplored in this context. In this paper, we propose a model- and knowledge-agnostic method to localize where specific types of knowledge are encoded within the DiT blocks. We evaluate our method on state-of-the-art DiT-based models, including PixArt-alpha, FLUX, and SANA, across six diverse knowledge categories. We show that the identified blocks are both interpretable and causally linked to the expression of knowledge in generated outputs. Building on these insights, we apply our localization framework to two key applications: model personalization and knowledge unlearning. In both settings, our localized fine-tuning approach enables efficient and targeted updates, reducing computational cost, improving task-specific performance, and better preserving general model behavior with minimal interference to unrelated or surrounding content. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the internal structure of DiTs and introduce a practical pathway for more interpretable, efficient, and controllable model editing.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a knowledge distillation-driven and diffusion-enhanced (KDD) semantic non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), named KDD-SemNOMA, for multi-user uplink wireless image transmission. Specifically, to ensure robust feature transmission across diverse transmission conditions, we firstly develop a ConvNeXt-based deep joint source and channel coding architecture with enhanced adaptive feature module. This module incorporates signal-to-noise ratio and channel state information to dynamically adapt to additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, to improve image restoration quality without inference overhead, we introduce a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, i.e., a teacher model, trained on interference-free orthogonal transmission, guides a student model via feature affinity distillation and cross-head prediction distillation. Moreover, a diffusion model-based refinement stage leverages generative priors to transform initial SemNOMA outputs into high-fidelity images with enhanced perceptual quality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-256 datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions. These results highlight the advantages in both pixel-level accuracy and perceptual metrics, effectively mitigating interference and enabling high-quality image recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Version Age of Information Scheduling: Average and Tail-Risk-Sensitive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18069v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring timely and semantically accurate information delivery is critical in real-time wireless systems. While Age of Information (AoI) quantifies temporal freshness, Version Age of Information (VAoI) captures semantic staleness by accounting for version evolution between transmitters and receivers. Existing VAoI scheduling approaches primarily focus on minimizing average VAoI, overlooking rare but severe staleness events that can compromise reliability under stochastic packet arrivals and unreliable channels. This paper investigates both average-oriented and tail-risk-sensitive VAoI scheduling in a multi-user status update system with long-term transmission cost constraints. We first formulate the average VAoI minimization problem as a constrained Markov decision process and introduce a deep diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic (D2SAC) algorithm. By generating actions through a diffusion-based denoising process, D2SAC enhances policy expressiveness and establishes a strong baseline for mean performance. Building on this foundation, we put forth RS-D3SAC, a risk-sensitive deep distributional diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic algorithm. RS-D3SAC integrates a diffusion-based actor with a quantile-based distributional critic, explicitly modeling the full VAoI return distribution. This enables principled tail-risk optimization via Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) while satisfying long-term transmission cost constraints. Extensive simulations show that, while D2SAC reduces average VAoI, RS-D3SAC consistently achieves substantial reductions in CVaR without sacrificing mean performance. The dominant gain in tail-risk reduction stems from the distributional critic, with the diffusion-based actor providing complementary refinement to stabilize and enrich policy decisions, highlighting their effectiveness for robust and risk-aware VAoI scheduling in multi-user wireless systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

The RemEdit diffusion-based framework addresses this trade-off with two synergistic innovations. First, for editing fidelity, we navigate the latent space as a Riemannian manifold. A mamba-based module efficiently learns the manifold's structure, enabling direct and accurate geodesic path computation for smooth semantic edits. This control is further refined by a dual-SLERP blending technique and a goal-aware prompt enrichment pass from a Vision-Language Model. Second, for additional acceleration, we introduce a novel task-specific attention pruning mechanism. A lightweight pruning head learns to retain tokens essential to the edit, enabling effective optimization without the semantic degradation common in content-agnostic approaches. RemEdit surpasses prior state-of-the-art editing frameworks while maintaining real-time performance under 50% pruning. Consequently, RemEdit establishes a new benchmark for practical and powerful image editing. Source code: https://www.github.com/eashanadhikarla/RemEdit.</p></details> |  |
| **[dLLM-ASR: A Faster Diffusion LLM-based Framework for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17902v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on large language models (LLMs) achieve superior performance by leveraging pretrained LLMs as decoders, but their token-by-token generation mechanism leads to inference latency that grows linearly with sequence length. Meanwhile, discrete diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling high-quality parallel sequence generation with pretrained decoders. However, directly applying native text-oriented dLLMs to ASR leads to a fundamental mismatch between open-ended text generation and the acoustically conditioned transcription paradigm required by ASR. As a result, it introduces unnecessary difficulty and computational redundancy, such as denoising from pure noise, inflexible generation lengths, and fixed denoising steps. We propose dLLM-ASR, an efficient dLLM-based ASR framework that formulates dLLM's decoding as a prior-guided and adaptive denoising process. It leverages an ASR prior to initialize the denoising process and provide an anchor for sequence length. Building upon this prior, length-adaptive pruning dynamically removes redundant tokens, while confidence-based denoising allows converged tokens to exit the denoising loop early, enabling token-level adaptive computation. Experiments demonstrate that dLLM-ASR achieves recognition accuracy comparable to autoregressive LLM-based ASR systems and delivers a 4.44$\times$ inference speedup, establishing a practical and efficient paradigm for ASR.</p></details> |  |

We propose VidLaDA, a Video LLM based on Diffusion Language Model utilizing bidirectional attention to capture bidirectional dependencies. To further tackle the inference bottleneck of diffusion decoding on massive video tokens, we introduce MARS-Cache. This framework accelerates inference by combining asynchronous visual cache refreshing with frame-wise chunk attention, effectively pruning redundancy while preserving global connectivity via anchor tokens. Extensive experiments show VidLaDA outperforms diffusion baselines and rivals state-of-the-art autoregressive models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA-Video), with MARS-Cache delivering over 12x speedup without compromising reasoning accuracy.

Existing methods addressing this issue, such as REPA (relying on external representation encoders) or SRA (requiring dual-model setups), inevitably incur heavy computational overhead during training due to external dependencies. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes \textbf{\namex}, a lightweight intrinsic guidance framework for efficient diffusion training. \name leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) features: their reconstruction property ensures inherent encoding of visual priors like rich texture details, structural patterns, and basic semantic information. Specifically, \name aligns the intermediate latent features of diffusion transformers with VAE features via a lightweight projection layer, supervised by a feature alignment loss. This design accelerates training without extra representation encoders or dual-model maintenance, resulting in a simple yet effective pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \name improves both generation quality and training convergence speed compared to vanilla diffusion transformers, matches or outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, and incurs merely 4\% extra GFLOPs with zero additional cost for external guidance models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal into multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. To better utilize the wireless resources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, namely non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate, to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users' reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</p></details> |

Existing GR methods predominantly rely on left-to-right auto-regressive decoding, which suffers from two fundamental limitations: (i) a \emph{mismatch between DocID generation and natural language generation}, whereby an incorrect DocID token generated at an early step can lead to entirely erroneous retrieval; and (ii) an \emph{inability to dynamically balance the trade-off between retrieval efficiency and accuracy}, which is crucial for practical applications. To tackle these challenges, we propose generative document retrieval with diffusion language models, termed \emph{DiffuGR}. DiffuGR formulates DocID generation as a discrete diffusion process. During training, DocIDs are corrupted through a stochastic masking process, and a diffusion language model is trained to recover them under a retrieval-aware objective. For inference, DiffuGR generates DocID tokens in parallel and refines them through a controllable number of denoising steps. Unlike auto-regressive decoding, DiffuGR introduce \emph{a novel mechanism to first generate plenty of confident DocID tokens and then refine the generation through diffusion-based denoising}. Moreover, DiffuGR also offers \emph{explicit runtime control over the quality-latency tradeoff}. Extensive experiments on widely-applied retrieval benchmarks show that DiffuGR outperforms strong auto-regressive generative retrievers. Additionally, we verify that DiffuGR achieves flexible control over the quality-latency trade-off via variable denoising budgets.</p></details> |  |

However, the underlying learning dynamics that contribute to the effectiveness of softmax remain largely unexplored. As a step towards better understanding, this paper provides a theoretical study of the optimization and generalization properties of two-layer softmax neural networks, providing theoretical insights into their superior performance as other activation functions, such as ReLU and exponential. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework, our analysis reveals that the normalization effect of the softmax function leads to a good perturbation property of the induced NTK matrix, resulting in a good convex region of the loss landscape. Consequently, softmax neural networks can learn the target function in the over-parametrization regime. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our theoretical findings, we apply them to the task of learning score estimation functions in diffusion models, a promising approach for generative modeling. Our analysis shows that gradient-based algorithms can learn the score function with a provable accuracy. Our work provides a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of softmax neural networks and their potential in various domains, paving the way for further advancements in natural language processing and beyond.</p></details> | 53 pages |

However, the scarcity of text image data in existing datasets results in poor performance on text regions. In addition, datasets consisting of isolated text samples limit the quality of background reconstruction. To address these limitations, we construct Real-Texts, a large-scale, high-quality dataset collected from real-world images, which covers diverse scenarios and contains natural text instances in both Chinese and English. Additionally, we propose the TEXTS-Aware Diffusion Model (TEXTS-Diff) to achieve high-quality generation in both background and textual regions. This approach leverages abstract concepts to improve the understanding of textual elements within visual scenes and concrete text regions to enhance textual details. It mitigates distortions and hallucination artifacts commonly observed in text regions, while preserving high-quality visual scene fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, exhibiting superior generalization ability and text restoration accuracy in complex scenarios.

We present an inference-time, region-constrained color preservation method that steers a pretrained diffusion model without any additional training. Our approach combines (i) ROI-based inpainting for spatial selectivity, (ii) background-latent re-imposition to prevent color drift outside the ROI, and (iii) latent nudging via gradient guidance using a composite loss defined in CIE Lab and linear RGB. The loss is constructed to control not only the mean ROI color but also the tail of the pixelwise error distribution through CVaR-style and soft-maximum penalties, with a late-start gate and a time-dependent schedule to stabilize guidance across denoising steps. We show that mean-only baselines can satisfy average color constraints while producing perceptually salient local failures, motivating our distribution-aware objective. The resulting method provides a practical, training-free mechanism for targeted color adherence that can be integrated into standard Stable Diffusion inpainting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 Pa...</summary><p>25 Pages, 12 Figures, 3 Tables, 5 Appendices, 8 Algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation with Latent Diffusion for Pathology Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17228v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models in computational pathology often fail to generalize across cohorts and institutions due to domain shift. Existing approaches either fail to leverage unlabeled data from the target domain or rely on image-to-image translation, which can distort tissue structures and compromise model accuracy. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that utilizes a latent diffusion model trained on unlabeled data from both the source and target domains to generate morphology-preserving and target-aware synthetic images. By conditioning the diffusion model on foundation model features, cohort identity, and tissue preparation method, we preserve tissue structure in the source domain while introducing target-domain appearance characteristics. The target-aware synthetic images, combined with real, labeled images from the source cohort, are subsequently used to train a downstream classifier, which is then tested on the target cohort. The effectiveness of the proposed SSDA framework is demonstrated on the task of lung adenocarcinoma prognostication. The proposed augmentation yielded substantially better performance on the held-out test set from the target cohort, without degrading source-cohort performance. The approach improved the weighted F1 score on the target-cohort held-out test set from 0.611 to 0.706 and the macro F1 score from 0.641 to 0.716. Our results demonstrate that target-aware diffusion-based synthetic data augmentation provides a promising and effective approach for improving domain generalization in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

The Conditional Diffusion Model-based Inverse Problem Solver (CDI) has previously demonstrated effective probabilistic inference for one-dimensional temporal signals, but its applicability to higher-dimensional spatial data remains unexplored. We extend CDI to two-dimensional spatial conditioning, enabling probabilistic parameter inference directly from spatial observations. We validate this extension on convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) parameter inference - a challenging multi-parameter inverse problem in materials characterization where sample geometry, electronic structure, and thermal properties must be extracted from 2D diffraction patterns. Using simulated CBED data with ground-truth parameters, we demonstrate that CDI produces well-calibrated posterior distributions that accurately reflect measurement constraints: tight distributions for well-determined quantities and appropriately broad distributions for ambiguous parameters. In contrast, standard regression methods - while appearing accurate on aggregate metrics - mask this underlying uncertainty by predicting training set means for poorly constrained parameters. Our results confirm that CDI successfully extends from temporal to spatial domains, providing the genuine uncertainty information required for robust scientific inference.</p></details> |  |

However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE. 15 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding.</p></details> |  |

This paper tackles the challenging yet most impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image, as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. We show that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones, necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments on SD-XL and FLUX-1.dev show that T-LoRA and its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model personalization techniques, achieving a superior balance between concept fidelity and text alignment.

A central practical challenge is resolving the trade-off between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism. To address inference efficiency, many recent works have explored knowledge distillation strategies specifically tailored to SR, enabling one-step diffusion-based approaches. However, these teacher-student formulations are inherently constrained by information compression, which can degrade perceptual cues such as lifelike textures and depth of field, even with high overall perceptual quality. In parallel, self-distillation DMs, known as Flow Map models, have emerged as a promising alternative for image generation tasks, enabling fast inference while preserving the expressivity and training stability of standard DMs. Building on these developments, we propose FlowMapSR, a novel diffusion-based framework for image super-resolution explicitly designed for efficient inference. Beyond adapting Flow Map models to SR, we introduce two complementary enhancements: (i) positive-negative prompting guidance, based on a generalization of classifier free-guidance paradigm to Flow Map models, and (ii) adversarial fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Among the considered Flow Map formulations (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Shortcut), we find that the Shortcut variant consistently achieves the best performance when combined with these enhancements. Extensive experiments show that FlowMapSR achieves a better balance between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism than recent state-of-the-art methods for both x4 and x8 upscaling, while maintaining competitive inference time. Notably, a single model is used for both upscaling factors, without any scale-specific conditioning or degradation-guided mechanisms.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Edge-Aware Image Manipulation via Diffusion Models with a Novel Structure-Preservation Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16645v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image editing leverage latent diffusion models (LDMs) for versatile, text-prompt-driven edits across diverse tasks. Yet, maintaining pixel-level edge structures-crucial for tasks such as photorealistic style transfer or image tone adjustment-remains as a challenge for latent-diffusion-based editing. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) that leverages local linear models to quantify structural differences between input and edited images. Our training-free approach integrates SPL directly into the diffusion model's generative process to ensure structural fidelity. This core mechanism is complemented by a post-processing step to mitigate LDM decoding distortions, a masking strategy for precise edit localization, and a color preservation loss to preserve hues in unedited areas. Experiments confirm SPL enhances structural fidelity, delivering state-of-the-art performance in latent-diffusion-based image editing. Our code will be publicly released at https://github.com/gongms00/SPL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |

This paper presents HumanDiffusion, a lightweight image-conditioned diffusion planner that generates human-aware navigation trajectories directly from RGB imagery. The system combines YOLO-11 based human detection with diffusion-driven trajectory generation, enabling a quadrotor to approach a target person and deliver medical assistance without relying on prior maps or computationally intensive planning pipelines. Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction. Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at HRI, Late Breaking Report, 2026</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Learning of Stationary Diffusions with Stein-type Discrepancies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16597v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning a stationary diffusion amounts to estimating the parameters of a stochastic differential equation whose stationary distribution matches a target distribution. We build on the recently introduced kernel deviation from stationarity (KDS), which enforces stationarity by evaluating expectations of the diffusion's generator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Leveraging the connection between KDS and Stein discrepancies, we introduce the Stein-type KDS (SKDS) as an alternative formulation. We prove that a vanishing SKDS guarantees alignment of the learned diffusion's stationary distribution with the target. Furthermore, under broad parametrizations, SKDS is convex with an empirical version that is $ε$-quasiconvex with high probability. Empirically, learning with SKDS attains comparable accuracy to KDS while substantially reducing computational cost and yields improvements over the majority of competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Bitter Lesson of Diffusion Language Models for Agentic Workflows: A Comprehensive Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12979v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of real-time agentic interaction has driven interest in Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) as alternatives to auto-regressive backbones, promising to break the sequential latency bottleneck. However, does such efficiency gains translate into effective agentic behavior? In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of dLLMs (e.g., LLaDA, Dream) across two distinct agentic paradigms: Embodied Agents (requiring long-horizon planning) and Tool-Calling Agents (requiring precise formatting). Contrary to the efficiency hype, our results on Agentboard and BFCL reveal a "bitter lesson": current dLLMs fail to serve as reliable agentic backbones, frequently leading to systematically failure. (1) In Embodied settings, dLLMs suffer repeated attempts, failing to branch under temporal feedback. (2) In Tool-Calling settings, dLLMs fail to maintain symbolic precision (e.g. strict JSON schemas) under diffusion noise. To assess the potential of dLLMs in agentic workflows, we introduce DiffuAgent, a multi-agent evaluation framework that integrates dLLMs as plug-and-play cognitive cores. Our analysis shows that dLLMs are effective in non-causal roles (e.g., memory summarization and tool selection) but require the incorporation of causal, precise, and logically grounded reasoning mechanisms into the denoising process to be viable for agentic tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[GazeD: Context-Aware Diffusion for Accurate 3D Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12948v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GazeD, a new 3D gaze estimation method that jointly provides 3D gaze and human pose from a single RGB image. Leveraging the ability of diffusion models to deal with uncertainty, it generates multiple plausible 3D gaze and pose hypotheses based on the 2D context information extracted from the input image. Specifically, we condition the denoising process on the 2D pose, the surroundings of the subject, and the context of the scene. With GazeD we also introduce a novel way of representing the 3D gaze by positioning it as an additional body joint at a fixed distance from the eyes. The rationale is that the gaze is usually closely related to the pose, and thus it can benefit from being jointly denoised during the diffusion process. Evaluations across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GazeD achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D gaze estimation, even surpassing methods that rely on temporal information. Project details will be available at https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/go/gazed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 3DV 2026.

| **[Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Cannot Count, and Prompt Refinement Cannot Help](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06884v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling is widely regarded as one of the most essential problems in today's AI community, with text-to-image generation having gained unprecedented real-world impacts. Among various approaches, diffusion models have achieved remarkable success and have become the de facto solution for text-to-image generation. However, despite their impressive performance, these models exhibit fundamental limitations in adhering to numerical constraints in user instructions, frequently generating images with an incorrect number of objects. While several prior works have mentioned this issue, a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of this limitation remains lacking. To address this gap, we introduce T2ICountBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the counting ability of state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse set of generative models, including both open-source and private systems. It explicitly isolates counting performance from other capabilities, provides structured difficulty levels, and incorporates human evaluations to ensure high reliability. Extensive evaluations with T2ICountBench reveal that all state-of-the-art diffusion models fail to generate the correct number of objects, with accuracy dropping significantly as the number of objects increases. Additionally, an exploratory study on prompt refinement demonstrates that such simple interventions generally do not improve counting accuracy. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges in numerical understanding within diffusion models and point to promising directions for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
