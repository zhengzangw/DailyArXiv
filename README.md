| **[RealDPO: Real or Not Real, that is the Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14955v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code:https://github.com/Vchitect/RealDPO Project Page:https://vchitect.github.io/RealDPO-Project/</p></details> |
| **[DialectGen: Benchmarking and Improving Dialect Robustness in Multimodal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14949v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200 unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Scene Prompting for Scene-Consistent Camera-Controllable Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14945v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality.

| **[Ctrl-VI: Controllable Video Synthesis via Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07670v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed input formats. We develop Ctrl-VI, a video synthesis method that addresses this need and generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to prior works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://video-synthesis-variational.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ImagerySearch: Adaptive Test-Time Search for Video Generation Beyond Semantic Dependency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14847v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Surgery: An Efficient Recipe to Linearize Your Video Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24899v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly retraining. We introduce Attention Surgery, an efficient framework for linearizing or hybridizing attention in pretrained VDMs without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models, our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers. Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models, reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.

| **[In-Context Learning with Unpaired Clips for Instruction-based Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14648v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality. Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[STANCE: Motion Coherent Video Generation Via Sparse-to-Dense Anchored Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14588v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps) often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance; and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse, user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB \(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, model, and demos can be found at https://envision-research.github.io/STANCE/</p></details> |
| **[Flows and Diffusions on the Neural Manifold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10623v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several trajectory inference techniques towards matching a gradient flow, providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts, where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 11 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[On Equivariance and Fast Sampling in Video Diffusion Models Trained with Warped Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09789v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporally consistent video-to-video generation is critical for applications such as style transfer and upsampling. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of warped noise - a recently proposed technique for training video diffusion models - and show that pairing it with the standard denoising objective implicitly trains models to be equivariant to spatial transformations of the input noise, which we term EquiVDM. This equivariance enables motion in the input noise to align naturally with motion in the generated video, yielding coherent, high-fidelity outputs without the need for specialized modules or auxiliary losses. A further advantage is sampling efficiency: EquiVDM achieves comparable or superior quality in far fewer sampling steps. When distilled into one-step student models, EquiVDM preserves equivariance and delivers stronger motion controllability and fidelity than distilled nonequivariant baselines. Across benchmarks, EquiVDM consistently outperforms prior methods in motion alignment, temporal consistency, and perceptual quality, while substantially lowering sampling cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[CVD-STORM: Cross-View Video Diffusion with Spatial-Temporal Reconstruction Model for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07944v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.

| **[Identity-GRPO: Optimizing Multi-Human Identity-preserving Video Generation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14256v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity-Preserving Image-to-Video Generation via Reward-Guided Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14255v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

| **[Virtually Being: Customizing Camera-Controllable Video Diffusion Models with Multi-View Performance Captures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14179v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video generation into virtual production.

| **[Real-Time Motion-Controllable Autoregressive Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08131v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control, then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page: https://kesenzhao.github.io/AR-Drag.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysMaster: Mastering Physical Representation for Video Generation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13809v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation, proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware video generation and broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sihuiji.github.io/PhysMaster-Page/</p></details> |
| **[QuaDreamer: Controllable Panoramic Video Generation for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02512v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and model weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025.

| **[CanvasMAR: Improving Masked Autoregressive Video Generation With Canvas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13669v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals diffusion-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MotionAgent: Fine-grained Controllable Video Generation via Motion Field Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03207v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MotionAgent, enabling fine-grained motion control for text-guided image-to-video generation. The key technique is the motion field agent that converts motion information in text prompts into explicit motion fields, providing flexible and precise motion guidance. Specifically, the agent extracts the object movement and camera motion described in the text and converts them into object trajectories and camera extrinsics, respectively. An analytical optical flow composition module integrates these motion representations in 3D space and projects them into a unified optical flow. An optical flow adapter takes the flow to control the base image-to-video diffusion model for generating fine-grained controlled videos. The significant improvement in the Video-Text Camera Motion metrics on VBench indicates that our method achieves precise control over camera motion. We construct a subset of VBench to evaluate the alignment of motion information in the text and the generated video, outperforming other advanced models on motion generation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIST3A: Text-to-3D by Stitching a Multi-view Reconstruction Network to a Video Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13454v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as "generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gohyojun15.github.io/VIST3A/</p></details> |
| **[SeqBench: Benchmarking Sequential Narrative Generation in Text-to-Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13042v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with 2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models.

| **[Frame Context Packing and Drift Prevention in Next-Frame-Prediction Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12626v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a neural network structure, FramePack, to train next-frame (or next-frame-section) prediction models for video generation. FramePack compresses input frame contexts with frame-wise importance so that more frames can be encoded within a fixed context length, with more important frames having longer contexts. The frame importance can be measured using time proximity, feature similarity, or hybrid metrics. The packing method allows for inference with thousands of frames and training with relatively large batch sizes. We also present drift prevention methods to address observation bias (error accumulation), including early-established endpoints, adjusted sampling orders, and discrete history representation. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the anti-drifting methods in both single-directional video streaming and bi-directional video generation. Finally, we show that existing video diffusion models can be finetuned with FramePack, and analyze the differences between different packing schedules.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack</p></details> |
| **[MVP4D: Multi-View Portrait Video Diffusion for Animatable 4D Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12785v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film, virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming, requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here, we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model, MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to 360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of generated avatars compared to previous methods.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12453v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and reconstruction fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[UVE: Are MLLMs Unified Evaluators for AI-Generated Videos?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09949v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of video generative models (VGMs), it is essential to develop reliable and comprehensive automatic metrics for AI-generated videos (AIGVs). Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 18 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Our theoretical analysis indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL) for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning. Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments. Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated videos and comparison results are in our project page.</p></details> |  |
| **[BIGFix: Bidirectional Image Generation with Token Fixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12231v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step, reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements across both modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation. First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[LongLive: Real-time Interactive Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22622v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity, especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long); and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation. With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains 20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal quality loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, model, and demos are available at https://github.com/NVlabs/LongLive</p></details> |

We show that this connection enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project link: https://point-prompting.github.io</p></details> |

Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content (AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video, highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems. Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts, showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation models.</p></details> |  |

SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Unlike existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers 164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director, orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://talkcuts.github.io/</p></details> |

Inspired by this, we explore the feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First, we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.</p></details> |  |

Recent acceleration methods enhance the efficiency by exploiting the local sparsity of attention scores; yet they often struggle with accelerating the long-range computation. To address this problem, we propose VORTA, an acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse attention variants. VORTA achieves an end-to-end speedup $1.76\times$ without loss of quality on VBench. Furthermore, it can seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as model caching and step distillation, reaching up to speedup $14.41\times$ with negligible performance degradation. VORTA demonstrates its efficiency and enhances the practicality of video diffusion transformers in real-world settings.

| **[EditCast3D: Single-Frame-Guided 3D Editing with Video Propagation and View Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13652v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation, we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this, EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models into 3D editing pipelines.

Data collection in these hazardous settings often limits the development of autonomous inspection systems. To mitigate this issue, we propose a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that integrates procedural rendering and AI-driven video generation. The approach uses BlenderProc to produce photorealistic images with domain randomization and NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2 to generate physically consistent video sequences with temporal variation. A YOLO-based detector trained on a composite dataset, combining real and synthetic data, outperformed models trained solely on real images. A 1:1 ratio between real and synthetic samples achieved the highest accuracy. The results demonstrate that synthetic data generation is a viable, cost-effective, and safe strategy for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiCOIN: Multi-Modal COntrollable Video INbetweening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08561v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex, or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we introduce MultiCOIN, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process, resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally, we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic, customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://multicoinx.github.io/multicoin/</p></details> |
| **[Stable Video Infinity: Infinite-Length Video Generation with Error Recycling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting (e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions (e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks, including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying its versatility and state-of-the-art role.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://stable-video-infinity.github.io/homepage/</p></details> |

To obtain training data, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated from independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained comparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion clips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce DenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three contributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted copies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar motion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing the motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label preferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and more precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO greatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text alignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that DenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences similar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO trained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight.

In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot action recognition.</p></details> | IJCAI2025 |

Existing datasets are noisy and weakly compositional, limiting models' understanding of complex scenes, while scalable solutions for dense, high-quality annotations remain a challenge. We introduce Generate Any Scene, a data engine that systematically enumerates scene graphs representing the combinatorial array of possible visual scenes. Generate Any Scene dynamically constructs scene graphs of varying complexity from a structured taxonomy of objects, attributes, and relations. Given a sampled scene graph, Generate Any Scene translates it into a caption for text-to-image or text-to-video generation; it also translates it into a set of visual question answers that allow automatic evaluation and reward modeling of semantic alignment. Using Generate Any Scene, we first design a self-improving framework where models iteratively enhance their performance using generated data. Stable Diffusion v1.5 achieves an average 4% improvement over baselines and surpassing fine-tuning on CC3M. Second, we also design a distillation algorithm to transfer specific strengths from proprietary models to their open-source counterparts. Using fewer than 800 synthetic captions, we fine-tune Stable Diffusion v1.5 and achieve a 10% increase in TIFA score on compositional and hard concept generation. Third, we create a reward model to align model generation with semantic accuracy at a low cost. Using GRPO algorithm, we fine-tune SimpleAR-0.5B-SFT and surpass CLIP-based methods by +5% on DPG-Bench. Finally, we apply these ideas to the downstream task of content moderation where we train models to identify challenging cases by learning from synthetic data.</p></details> |  |

Our key insight is that many regions in video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality.

Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms. We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without demonstrations or embodiment-specific training.

| **[VideoCanvas: Unified Video Completion from Arbitrary Spatiotemporal Patches via In-Context Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08555v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision, however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models: the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC) paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control: spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms, establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://onevfall.github.io/project_page/videocanvas</p></details> |

The intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry, and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention, which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154 rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions. Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues, enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning, drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible action control and mesh animations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bestzzhang.github.io/FlexTraj</p></details> |

Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To address these challenges, we introduce Paper2Video, the first benchmark of 101 research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding, subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward automated and ready-to-use academic video generation.

In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we will release our model and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website https://congwei1230.github.io/UniVideo/</p></details> |

However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released upon acceptance</p></details> |

Existing studies, however, are largely confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with existing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coefficients-Preserving Sampling for Reinforcement Learning with Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05952v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models, specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method, Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS</p></details> | work in progress |

This task faces persistent challenges, including identity inconsistency, entanglement among multiple reference subjects, and copy-paste artifacts. To address these issues, we introduce MAGREF, a unified and effective framework for any-reference video generation. Our approach incorporates masked guidance and a subject disentanglement mechanism, enabling flexible synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images and textual prompts. Specifically, masked guidance employs a region-aware masking mechanism combined with pixel-wise channel concatenation to preserve appearance features of multiple subjects along the channel dimension. This design preserves identity consistency and maintains the capabilities of the pre-trained backbone, without requiring any architectural changes. To mitigate subject confusion, we introduce a subject disentanglement mechanism which injects the semantic values of each subject derived from the text condition into its corresponding visual region. Additionally, we establish a four-stage data pipeline to construct diverse training pairs, effectively alleviating copy-paste artifacts. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate that MAGREF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for scalable, controllable, and high-fidelity any-reference video synthesis.

In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work, we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation on the fly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ttom-t2v.github.io/</p></details> |

To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to assist in long-sequence video storytelling by efficiently translating ideas into visual narratives. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief idea description, MAViS enables users to rapidly explore diverse visual storytelling and creative directions for sequential video generation by efficiently producing high-quality, complete long-sequence videos. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video Generation Agent</p></details> |

Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging. Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement: specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading performance under these constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages (including references), 4 figures.

While humans can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of 300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together, TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.</p></details> |  |

(i) While the emphasis is on subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation, however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with 45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases: occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements. Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic camera motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views. Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first 4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views. WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation, which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the anchor-wrist view gap.</p></details> |  |

This raises a key question: How do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers. Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation. We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations validate our design choices.

Nevertheless, current methods primarily concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel view synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 conference track</p></details> |

One key challenge in long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1) enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15% to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track different individuals in the captions of long videos.</p></details> |  |

This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework for video modeling in continuous space.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, video generation models are now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments. Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First, while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains, facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.

This often leads to unrealistic or physically implausible movements with inadequate structural coherence. To conquer these challenges, we propose MoSA, which decouples the process of human video generation into two components, i.e., structure generation and appearance generation. MoSA first employs a 3D structure transformer to generate a human motion sequence from the text prompt. The remaining video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of this structural sequence. We achieve fine-grained control over the sparse human structures by introducing Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules with a dense tracking constraint during training. The modeling of human-environment interactions is improved through the proposed contact constraint. Those two components work comprehensively to ensure the structural and appearance fidelity across the generated videos. This paper also contributes a large-scale human video dataset, which features more complex and diverse motions than existing human video datasets. We conduct comprehensive comparisons between MoSA and a variety of approaches, including general video generation models, human video generation models, and human animation models.

Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some measure of the content's goodness. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward at inference time. We then point out that improving perceptual video quality with respect to alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with the evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline: we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into enabling the lookahead estimator and increasing the search budget, rather than expanding the denoising steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2025.

| **[When and How to Cut Classical Concerts? A Multimodal Automated Video Editing Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05661v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut. Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments. We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art in multimodal automated video editing.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer rich physical context from the text prompt. To incorporate this context into the video diffusion model, we use a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to verify intermediate latent variables against the inferred physical rules, guiding the gradient updates of model accordingly. Textual output of LLM is transformed into continuous signals. We then formulate a set of training objectives that jointly ensure physical accuracy and semantic alignment with the input text. Additionally, failure facts of physical phenomena are corrected via attention injection. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

The redundancy of latents in diffusion model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper, we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage, while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range.

| **[VChain: Chain-of-Visual-Thought for Reasoning in Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05094v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing clips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent chain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain, a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically, VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex, multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://eyeline-labs.github.io/VChain Code: https://github.com/Eyeline-Labs/VChain</p></details> |
| **[Character Mixing for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05093v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where characters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve each character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and because mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation (CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative storytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page: https://tingtingliao.github.io/mimix/.</p></details> |  |

From its inception, the field has advanced from adversarial models to diffusion-based models, yielding higher-fidelity, temporally consistent outputs. Yet challenges persist, such as alignment, long-range coherence, and computational efficiency. Addressing this evolving landscape, we present a comprehensive survey of text-to-video generative models, tracing their development from early GANs and VAEs to hybrid Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) architectures, detailing how these models work, what limitations they addressed in their predecessors, and why shifts toward new architectural paradigms were necessary to overcome challenges in quality, coherence, and control. We provide a systematic account of the datasets, which the surveyed text-to-video models were trained and evaluated on, and, to support reproducibility and assess the accessibility of training such models, we detail their training configurations, including their hardware specifications, GPU counts, batch sizes, learning rates, optimizers, epochs, and other key hyperparameters. Further, we outline the evaluation metrics commonly used for evaluating such models and present their performance across standard benchmarks, while also discussing the limitations of these metrics and the emerging shift toward more holistic, perception-aligned evaluation strategies. Finally, drawing from our analysis, we outline the current open challenges and propose a few promising future directions, laying out a perspective for future researchers to explore and build upon in advancing T2V research and applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we provide a systematic and timely review of research efforts on defenses against AI-generated visual media, covering detection, disruption, and authentication. We review existing methods and summarize the mainstream defense-related tasks within a unified passive and proactive framework. Moreover, we survey the derivative tasks concerning the trustworthiness of defenses, such as their robustness and fairness. For each defense strategy, we formulate its general pipeline and propose a multidimensional taxonomy applicable across defense tasks, based on methodological strategies. Additionally, we summarize the commonly used evaluation datasets, criteria, and metrics.

Yet, not all mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i) whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like MaskGIT.</p></details> |  |
| **[STIV: Scalable Text and Image Conditioned Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07730v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of video generation has made remarkable advancements, yet there remains a pressing need for a clear, systematic recipe that can guide the development of robust and scalable models. In this work, we present a comprehensive study that systematically explores the interplay of model architectures, training recipes, and data curation strategies, culminating in a simple and scalable text-image-conditioned video generation method, named STIV. Our framework integrates image condition into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) through frame replacement, while incorporating text conditioning via a joint image-text conditional classifier-free guidance. This design enables STIV to perform both text-to-video (T2V) and text-image-to-video (TI2V) tasks simultaneously. Additionally, STIV can be easily extended to various applications, such as video prediction, frame interpolation, multi-view generation, and long video generation, etc. With comprehensive ablation studies on T2I, T2V, and TI2V, STIV demonstrate strong performance, despite its simple design. An 8.7B model with 512 resolution achieves 83.1 on VBench T2V, surpassing both leading open and closed-source models like CogVideoX-5B, Pika, Kling, and Gen-3. The same-sized model also achieves a state-of-the-art result of 90.1 on VBench I2V task at 512 resolution. By providing a transparent and extensible recipe for building cutting-edge video generation models, we aim to empower future research and accelerate progress toward more versatile and reliable video generation solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChronoEdit: Towards Temporal Reasoning for Image Editing and World Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04290v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit will be released on the project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/chronoedit</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/chronoedit</p></details> |

However, the extent to which these AI-generated videos simulate the 3D visual world remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Learned 3D Evaluation (L3DE), an objective, quantifiable, and interpretable method for assessing AI-generated videos' ability to simulate the real world in terms of 3D visual qualities and consistencies, without requiring manually labeled defects or quality annotations. Instead of relying on 3D reconstruction, which is prone to failure with in-the-wild videos, L3DE employs a 3D convolutional network, trained on monocular 3D cues of motion, depth, and appearance, to distinguish real from synthetic videos. Confidence scores from L3DE quantify the gap between real and synthetic videos in terms of 3D visual coherence, while a gradient-based visualization pinpoints unrealistic regions, improving interpretability. We validate L3DE through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong alignment with 3D reconstruction quality and human judgments. Our evaluations on leading generative models (e.g., Kling, Sora, and MiniMax) reveal persistent simulation gaps and subtle inconsistencies. Beyond generative video assessment, L3DE extends to broader applications: benchmarking video generation models, serving as a deepfake detector, and enhancing video synthesis by inpainting flagged inconsistencies.

| **[Mixture of Contexts for Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21058v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://primecai.github.io/moc/</p></details> |

However, most video diffusion models are constrained by limited resolution and aspect ratio, which restricts their applicability to scene-level dynamic content synthesis. In this work, we propose $\textbf{DynamicScaler}$, addressing these challenges by enabling spatially scalable and panoramic dynamic scene synthesis that preserves coherence across panoramic scenes of arbitrary size. Specifically, we introduce a Offset Shifting Denoiser, facilitating efficient, synchronous, and coherent denoising panoramic dynamic scenes via a diffusion model with fixed resolution through a seamless rotating Window, which ensures seamless boundary transitions and consistency across the entire panoramic space, accommodating varying resolutions and aspect ratios. Additionally, we employ a Global Motion Guidance mechanism to ensure both local detail fidelity and global motion continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior content and motion quality in panoramic scene-level video generation, offering a training-free, efficient, and scalable solution for immersive dynamic scene creation with constant VRAM consumption regardless of the output video resolution.

| **[Controllable Video Generation with Provable Disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02690v3)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable video generation remains a significant challenge, despite recent advances in generating high-quality and consistent videos. Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Despite the rapid progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation. It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs, mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions, conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, Project Page:https://hyelinnam.github.io/Cameo/</p></details> |

To meet the computational demands of AI tasks, current mobile SoCs are equipped with diverse AI accelerators, including GPUs and Neural Processing Units (NPUs). However, there has not been a comprehensive characterization of these heterogeneous processors, and existing designs typically only leverage a single AI accelerator for LLM inference, leading to suboptimal use of computational resources and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we first summarize key performance characteristics of heterogeneous processors, SoC memory bandwidth, etc. Drawing on these observations, we propose different heterogeneous parallel mechanisms to fully exploit both GPU and NPU computational power and memory bandwidth. We further design a fast synchronization mechanism between heterogeneous processors that leverages the unified memory architecture. By employing these techniques, we present HeteroInfer, the fastest LLM inference engine in mobile devices which supports GPU-NPU heterogeneous execution. Evaluation shows that HeteroInfer delivers a 1.34x to 6.02x end-to-end speedup over state-of-the-art GPU-only and NPU-only LLM engines, while maintaining negligible interference with other applications.</p></details> |  |

They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. (3) RACCooN also plans to imagine new objects in a given video, so users simply prompt the model to receive a detailed video editing plan for complex video editing. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 main; The first two authors contribute equally.

However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://reagan1311.github.io/mask2iv</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we make two contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing the practical usability of autoregressive video models.</p></details> |  |

Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer, which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust ``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information, achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions, offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods fall short when scenes contain poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that demonstrates the transformation process from less favorable to aesthetically enhanced perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users to enhance their composition skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model. Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss, our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://beijia11.github.io/IASA</p></details> |

However, like large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate, producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns. To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring Dynamic Physical Properties from Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02311v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid, and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiModal Action Conditioned Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02287v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control. General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Generate Object Interactions with Physics-Guided Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02284v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however, current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore, KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Forcing++: Towards Minute-Scale High-Quality Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02283v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos. Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to 20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/</p></details> | preprint |
| **[TempoControl: Temporal Attention Guidance for Text-to-Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02226v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications, including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as action and audio-aligned generation.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Multi-marginal temporal Schrödinger Bridge Matching for video generation from unpaired data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01894v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Existing solutions either rely on extensive manual scripting/editing or prioritize single-shot fidelity over cross-scene continuity, limiting their practicality for movie-like content. We introduce VideoGen-of-Thought (VGoT), a step-by-step framework that automates multi-shot video synthesis from a single sentence by systematically addressing three core challenges: (1) Narrative fragmentation: Existing methods lack structured storytelling. We propose dynamic storyline modeling, which turns the user prompt into concise shot drafts and then expands them into detailed specifications across five domains (character dynamics, background continuity, relationship evolution, camera movements, and HDR lighting) with self-validation to ensure logical progress. (2) Visual inconsistency: previous approaches struggle to maintain consistent appearance across shots. Our identity-aware cross-shot propagation builds identity-preserving portrait (IPP) tokens that keep character identity while allowing controlled trait changes (expressions, aging) required by the story. (3) Transition artifacts: Abrupt shot changes disrupt immersion. Our adjacent latent transition mechanisms implement boundary-aware reset strategies that process adjacent shots' features at transition points, enabling seamless visual flow while preserving narrative continuity. Combined in a training-free pipeline, VGoT surpasses strong baselines by 20.4\% in within-shot face consistency and 17.4\% in style consistency, while requiring 10x fewer manual adjustments. VGoT bridges the gap between raw visual synthesis and director-level storytelling for automated multi-shot video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/DuNGEOnmassster/VideoGen-of-Thought.git; Webpage: https://cheliosoops.github.io/VGoT/</p></details> |
| **[AniMaker: Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10540v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.</p></details> |  |

These models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for multi-view consistent editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://coupled-diffusion.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Attention Is All You Need for KV Cache in Diffusion LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14973v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose ${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences, and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput ($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://vila-lab.github.io/elastic-cache-webpage/</p></details> |
| **[RainDiff: End-to-end Precipitation Nowcasting Via Token-wise Attention Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14962v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder, adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion, thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Parallel Samplers for Recurrent-Depth Models and Their Connection to Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14961v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence. Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently, our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal, diffusion language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at https://github.com/seal-rg/recurrent-pretraining</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Action-Guided Diffusion Policy (DP-AG), a unified representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP-AG encodes latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning between perception and action, we introduce a cycle-consistent contrastive loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent perception-action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP-AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP-AG offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE) and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

ConDiSim leverages denoising diffusion probabilistic models to approximate posterior distributions, consisting of a forward process that adds Gaussian noise to parameters, and a reverse process learning to denoise, conditioned on observed data. This approach effectively captures complex dependencies and multi-modalities within posteriors. ConDiSim is evaluated across ten benchmark problems and two real-world test problems, where it demonstrates effective posterior approximation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and stability in model training. ConDiSim offers a robust and extensible framework for simulation-based inference, particularly suitable for parameter inference workflows requiring fast inference methods.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

While prior research has primarily examined demographic and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent historical contexts remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark for evaluating how TTI models depict historical contexts. The benchmark combines HistVis, a dataset of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three state-of-the-art diffusion models from carefully designed prompts covering universal human activities across multiple historical periods, with a reproducible evaluation protocol. We evaluate generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras; (2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible demographic patterns. By providing a reproducible benchmark for historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an initial step toward building more historically accurate TTI models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Surgery: An Efficient Recipe to Linearize Your Video Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24899v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly retraining. We introduce Attention Surgery, an efficient framework for linearizing or hybridizing attention in pretrained VDMs without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models, our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers. Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models, reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.

Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA, an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerated Multi-Modal Motion Planning Using Context-Conditioned Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14615v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical methods in robot motion planning, such as sampling-based and optimization-based methods, often struggle with scalability towards higher-dimensional state spaces and complex environments. Diffusion models, known for their capability to learn complex, high-dimensional and multi-modal data distributions, provide a promising alternative when applied to motion planning problems and have already shown interesting results. However, most of the current approaches train their model for a single environment, limiting their generalization to environments not seen during training. The techniques that do train a model for multiple environments rely on a specific camera to provide the model with the necessary environmental information and therefore always require that sensor. To effectively adapt to diverse scenarios without the need for retraining, this research proposes Context-Aware Motion Planning Diffusion (CAMPD). CAMPD leverages a classifier-free denoising probabilistic diffusion model, conditioned on sensor-agnostic contextual information. An attention mechanism, integrated in the well-known U-Net architecture, conditions the model on an arbitrary number of contextual parameters. CAMPD is evaluated on a 7-DoF robot manipulator and benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches on real-world tasks, showing its ability to generalize to unseen environments and generate high-quality, multi-modal trajectories, at a fraction of the time required by existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted and has not yet been peer reviewed or accepted for publication</p></details> |

This study examined whether six text-to-image models (Janus-Pro-7B VL2 vs. VL3, DALL-E 3 v. April 2024 vs. August 2025, Stable Diffusion v. 1.6 vs. 3.5, SDXL v. April 2024 vs. FLUX.1 Pro, and Midjourney v. 5.1 vs. 7) perpetuate non-rational beliefs regarding autism by comparing images generated in 2024-2025 with controls. 53 prompts aimed at neutrally visualizing concrete objects and abstract concepts related to autism were used against 53 controls (baseline total N=302, follow-up experimental 280 images plus 265 controls). Expert assessment measuring the presence of common autism-related stereotypes employed a framework of 10 deductive codes followed by statistical analysis. Autistic individuals were depicted with striking homogeneity in skin color (white), gender (male), and age (young), often engaged in solitary activities, interacting with objects rather than people, and exhibiting stereotypical emotional expressions such as sadness, anger, or emotional flatness. In contrast, the images of neurotypical individuals were more diverse and lacked such traits. We found significant differences between the models; however, with a moderate effect size, and no differences between baseline and follow-up summary values, with the ratio of stereotypical themes to the number of images similar across all models. The control prompts showed a significantly lower degree of stereotyping with large size effects, confirming the hidden biases of the models. In summary, despite improvements in the technical aspects of image generation, the level of reproduction of potentially harmful autism-related stereotypes remained largely unaffected.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of a publication accepted to Identity-Aware AI 2025 (ECAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[ART-VITON: Measurement-Guided Latent Diffusion for Artifact-Free Virtual Try-On](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25749v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis, preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions. However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation, leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0 demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background, eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Noise Projection: Closing the Prompt-Agnostic Gap Behind Text-to-Image Misalignment in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14526v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection. In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch: during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising. Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training, without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves text-image alignment across diverse prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appen...</summary><p>Appendix will be appended soon</p></details> |

Existing methods often require extensive training or costly self-supervised optimization. In this paper, we present OmnimatteZero, a training-free approach that leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained video diffusion models for omnimatte. It can remove objects from videos, extract individual object layers along with their effects, and composite those objects onto new videos. These are accomplished by adapting zero-shot image inpainting techniques for video object removal, a task they fail to handle effectively out-of-the-box. To overcome this, we introduce temporal and spatial attention guidance modules that steer the diffusion process for accurate object removal and temporally consistent background reconstruction. We further show that self-attention maps capture information about the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's effects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent arithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new video layers to produce new videos. Evaluations show that OmnimatteZero not only achieves superior performance in terms of background reconstruction but also sets a new record for the fastest Omnimatte approach, achieving real-time performance with minimal frame runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH ASIA 2025.

| **[Restoring Noisy Demonstration for Imitation Learning With Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14467v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn a policy from expert demonstrations and has been applied to various applications. By learning from the expert policy, IL methods do not require environmental interactions or reward signals. However, most existing imitation learning algorithms assume perfect expert demonstrations, but expert demonstrations often contain imperfections caused by errors from human experts or sensor/control system inaccuracies. To address the above problems, this work proposes a filter-and-restore framework to best leverage expert demonstrations with inherent noise. Our proposed method first filters clean samples from the demonstrations and then learns conditional diffusion models to recover the noisy ones. We evaluate our proposed framework and existing methods in various domains, including robot arm manipulation, dexterous manipulation, and locomotion. The experiment results show that our proposed framework consistently outperforms existing methods across all the tasks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component and demonstrate the framework's robustness to different noise types and levels. These results confirm the practical applicability of our framework to noisy offline demonstration data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Compositional Phase Diffusion for Long Motion Sequence Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14427v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on motion generation has shown significant progress in generating semantically aligned motion with singular semantics. However, when employing these models to create composite sequences containing multiple semantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the continuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips, resulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these challenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the Semantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module (TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from adjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM operate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the pre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them to learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from variable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating compositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input conditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding and succeeding motion clips. Additionally, motion inbetweening task is made possible by keeping the phase parameter of the input motion sequences fixed throughout the diffusion process, showcasing the potential for extending the proposed framework to accommodate various application scenarios.

Previous arts failed to address both of them, always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band, while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row. Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile, serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 11 figures, to appear at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several trajectory inference techniques towards matching a gradient flow, providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts, where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 11 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[On Equivariance and Fast Sampling in Video Diffusion Models Trained with Warped Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09789v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporally consistent video-to-video generation is critical for applications such as style transfer and upsampling. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of warped noise - a recently proposed technique for training video diffusion models - and show that pairing it with the standard denoising objective implicitly trains models to be equivariant to spatial transformations of the input noise, which we term EquiVDM. This equivariance enables motion in the input noise to align naturally with motion in the generated video, yielding coherent, high-fidelity outputs without the need for specialized modules or auxiliary losses. A further advantage is sampling efficiency: EquiVDM achieves comparable or superior quality in far fewer sampling steps. When distilled into one-step student models, EquiVDM preserves equivariance and delivers stronger motion controllability and fidelity than distilled nonequivariant baselines. Across benchmarks, EquiVDM consistently outperforms prior methods in motion alignment, temporal consistency, and perceptual quality, while substantially lowering sampling cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN for Iris Presentation Attack Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14314v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs) where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this, we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN (MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

| **[Defending Diffusion Models Against Membership Inference Attacks via Higher-Order Langevin Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14225v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence applications have raised new data security concerns. This paper focuses on defending diffusion models against membership inference attacks. This type of attack occurs when the attacker can determine if a certain data point was used to train the model. Although diffusion models are intrinsically more resistant to membership inference attacks than other generative models, they are still susceptible. The defense proposed here utilizes critically-damped higher-order Langevin dynamics, which introduces several auxiliary variables and a joint diffusion process along these variables. The idea is that the presence of auxiliary variables mixes external randomness that helps to corrupt sensitive input data earlier on in the diffusion process. This concept is theoretically investigated and validated on a toy dataset and a speech dataset using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves and the FID metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Nonparametric Data Attribution for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14269v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images. SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation. CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization.

With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.

Existing approaches typically require monocular videos or calibrated multi-view images as inputs, whose applicability could be weakened in real-world scenarios with arbitrary and/or unknown camera poses. In this paper, we aim to generate the set of 3DGS attributes via a diffusion-based framework conditioned on human priors extracted from a single image. Specifically, we begin with carefully integrated human-centric feature extraction procedures to deduce informative conditioning signals. Based on our empirical observations that jointly learning the whole 3DGS attributes is challenging to optimize, we design a multi-stage generation strategy to obtain different types of 3DGS attributes. To facilitate the training process, we investigate constructing proxy ground-truth 3D Gaussian attributes as high-quality attribute-level supervision signals. Through extensive experiments, our HuGDiffusion shows significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRACE: Your Diffusion Model is Secretly an Instance Edge Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07982v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality instance and panoptic segmentation has traditionally relied on dense instance-level annotations such as masks, boxes, or points, which are costly, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Unsupervised and weakly-supervised approaches reduce this burden but remain constrained by semantic backbone constraints and human bias, often producing merged or fragmented outputs. We present TRACE (TRAnsforming diffusion Cues to instance Edges), showing that text-to-image diffusion models secretly function as instance edge annotators. TRACE identifies the Instance Emergence Point (IEP) where object boundaries first appear in self-attention maps, extracts boundaries through Attention Boundary Divergence (ABDiv), and distills them into a lightweight one-step edge decoder. This design removes the need for per-image diffusion inversion, achieving 81x faster inference while producing sharper and more connected boundaries. On the COCO benchmark, TRACE improves unsupervised instance segmentation by +5.1 AP, and in tag-supervised panoptic segmentation it outperforms point-supervised baselines by +1.7 PQ without using any instance-level labels. These results reveal that diffusion models encode hidden instance boundary priors, and that decoding these signals offers a practical and scalable alternative to costly manual annotation.

We introduce ConDA (Contrastive Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DISTAR, a zero-shot text-to-speech framework that operates entirely in a discrete residual vector quantization (RVQ) code space and tightly couples an AR language model with a masked diffusion model, without forced alignment or a duration predictor. Concretely, DISTAR drafts block-level RVQ tokens with an AR language model and then performs parallel masked-diffusion infilling conditioned on the draft to complete the next block, yielding long-form synthesis with blockwise parallelism while mitigating classic AR exposure bias. The discrete code space affords explicit control at inference: DISTAR produces high-quality audio under both greedy and sample-based decoding using classifier-free guidance, supports trade-offs between robustness and diversity, and enables variable bit-rate and controllable computation via RVQ layer pruning at test time. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style consistency, while maintaining rich output diversity.

Existing AR video diffusion models are limited to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control, then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B parameters.

Recently, they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring additional training.

Traditional fingerprinting methods struggle to scale to large, dynamic outdoor environments and require dense, impractical data surveys. To overcome these limitations, our approach learns a direct mapping from raw uplink Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) fingerprints to continuous geographic coordinates. We demonstrate that our DiffLoc framework achieves unprecedented sub-centimeter precision, with our best model (DiffLoc-CT) delivering 0.5 cm fusion accuracy and 1-2 cm single base station (BS) accuracy in a realistic, ray-traced Tokyo urban macro-cell environment. This represents an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing methods, including supervised regression approaches (over 10 m error) and grid-based fusion (3 m error). Our consistency training approach reduces inference time from 200 steps to just 2 steps while maintaining exceptional accuracy even for high-speed users (15-25 m/s) and unseen user trajectories, demonstrating the practical feasibility of our framework for real-time 6G applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing estimation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks and real data.</p></details> |  |

With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and parabolic equations. Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs, providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential equation solvers.</p></details> |  |

The variability of system parameters (e.g., admittances, topology) further contributes to the multiplicity of dispatch setpoints for a given load. Existing deep learning OPF solvers are single-valued and thus fail to capture the variability of system parameters unless fully represented in the feature space, which is prohibitive. To solve this problem, we introduce a diffusion-based OPF solver, termed \textit{DiffOPF}, that treats OPF as a conditional sampling problem. The solver learns the joint distribution of loads and dispatch setpoints from operational history, and returns the marginal dispatch distributions conditioned on loads. Unlike single-valued solvers, DiffOPF enables sampling statistically credible warm starts with favorable cost and constraint satisfaction trade-offs. We explore the sample complexity of DiffOPF to ensure the OPF solution within a prescribed distance from the optimization-based solution, and verify this experimentally on power system benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, training such models typically requires a large dataset of high-dimensional channel measurements, which are very difficult and expensive to obtain. This paper introduces a novel method for generating synthetic wireless channel data using diffusion-based models to produce user-specific channels that accurately reflect real-world wireless environments. Our approach employs a conditional denoising diffusion implicit model (cDDIM) framework, effectively capturing the relationship between user location and multi-antenna channel characteristics. We generate synthetic high fidelity channel samples using user positions as conditional inputs, creating larger augmented datasets to overcome measurement scarcity. The utility of this method is demonstrated through its efficacy in training various downstream tasks such as channel compression and beam alignment. Our diffusion-based augmentation approach achieves over a 1-2 dB gain in NMSE for channel compression, and an 11dB SNR boost in beamforming compared to prior methods, such as noise addition or the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Diffusion-Refined Planner with Reinforcement Learning Priors for Confined-Space Parking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14000v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for parking has increased the need for automated parking planning methods that can operate reliably in confined spaces. In restricted and complex environments, high-precision maneuvers are required to achieve a high success rate in planning, yet existing approaches often rely on explicit action modeling, which faces challenges when accurately modeling the optimal action distribution. In this paper, we propose DRIP, a diffusion-refined planner anchored in reinforcement learning (RL) prior action distribution, in which an RL-pretrained policy provides prior action distributions to regularize the diffusion training process. During the inference phase the denoising process refines these coarse priors into more precise action distributions. By steering the denoising trajectory through the reinforcement learning prior distribution during training, the diffusion model inherits a well-informed initialization, resulting in more accurate action modeling, a higher planning success rate, and reduced inference steps. We evaluate our approach across parking scenarios with varying degrees of spatial constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves planning performance in confined-space parking environments while maintaining strong generalization in common scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/FelixMessi/QDLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Work in Progress</p></details> |

This challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access to model weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code available at: https://github.com/nirgoren/NoisePrints</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Visual Conditioning for Semantic Consistency in Diffusion-Based Story Continuation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13787v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior visuals conflict with the current input.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce \textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in \href{https://github.com/EnVision-Research/UniCalli}{this URL}.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Cyclic Self-Supervised Diffusion for Ultra Low-field to High-field MRI Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13735v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However, synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure correction network enhances local feature restoration through self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR, 0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and anatomically consistent.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention, which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and customization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/mvcustom</p></details> |
| **[Generating healthy counterfactuals with denoising diffusion bridge models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13684v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart. More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) - which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  |

These large-scale datasets are often dominated by common environmental conditions such as "Clear and Day" weather, leading to decreased performance in under-represented conditions like "Rainy and Night". To address this issue, we introduce SynDiff-AD, a novel data augmentation pipeline that leverages diffusion models (DMs) to generate realistic images for such subgroups. SynDiff-AD uses ControlNet-a DM that guides data generation conditioned on semantic maps-along with a novel prompting scheme that generates subgroup-specific, semantically dense prompts. By augmenting datasets with SynDiff-AD, we improve the performance of segmentation models like Mask2Former and SegFormer by up to 1.2% and 2.3% on the Waymo dataset, and up to 1.4% and 0.7% on the DeepDrive dataset, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate that our SynDiff-AD pipeline enhances the driving performance of end-to-end autonomous driving models, like AIM-2D and AIM-BEV, by up to 20% across diverse environmental conditions in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, providing a more robust model. We release our code and pipeline at https://github.com/UTAustin-SwarmLab/SynDiff-AD.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Steerable Conditional Diffusion for Domain Adaptation in PET Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13441v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently enabled state-of-the-art reconstruction of positron emission tomography (PET) images while requiring only image training data. However, domain shift remains a key concern for clinical adoption: priors trained on images from one anatomy, acquisition protocol or pathology may produce artefacts on out-of-distribution data. We propose integrating steerable conditional diffusion (SCD) with our previously-introduced likelihood-scheduled diffusion (PET-LiSch) framework to improve the alignment of the diffusion model's prior to the target subject. At reconstruction time, for each diffusion step, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align the diffusion model prior with the target domain on the fly. Experiments on realistic synthetic 2D brain phantoms demonstrate that our approach suppresses hallucinated artefacts under domain shift, i.e. when our diffusion model is trained on perturbed images and tested on normal anatomy, our approach suppresses the hallucinated structure, outperforming both OSEM and diffusion model baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. These results provide a proof-of-concept that steerable priors can mitigate domain shift in diffusion-based PET reconstruction and motivate future evaluation on real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at IEEE NSS MIC RTSD 2025 (submitted May 2025; accepted July 2025; to be presented Nov 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Latent Refinement Decoding: Enhancing Diffusion-Based Language Models by Refining Belief States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11052v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream, mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding (HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.</p></details> |  |

Most existing imitation learning approaches often treat visuotactile feedback only as an additional observation, leaving applied forces as an uncontrolled consequence of gripper commands. In this work, we present Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM), an imitation learning framework that integrates high-dimensional tactile data to infer tactile-conditioned force signals, which in turn define a matching force-based action space. We collect human demonstrations using a modified version of the handheld Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) gripper that integrates a GelSight Mini visual tactile sensor. For deploying the learned policies, we developed an actuated variant of the UMI gripper with geometry matching our handheld version. During policy rollouts, the proposed FARM diffusion policy jointly predicts robot pose, grip width, and grip force. FARM outperforms several baselines across three tasks with distinct force requirements -- high-force, low-force, and dynamic force adaptation -- demonstrating the advantages of its two key components: leveraging force-grounded, high-dimensional tactile observations and a force-based control space. The codebase and design files are open-sourced and available at https://tactile-farm.github.io .</p></details> |  |
| **[Km-scale dynamical downscaling through conformalized latent diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13301v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling. Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates, incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological fields.</p></details> | 7 pages |

This separation hinders the joint representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing, we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Despite extensive study, existing systems, however, suffer from various limitations: First, the channel measurement rate proves inadequate to estimate high moving speeds. Second, previous acoustic speed estimation exploits Doppler Frequency Shifts (DFS) created by moving targets and relies on microphone arrays, making them only capable of sensing the radial speed within a constrained distance. To overcome these issues, we present ASE, an accurate and robust Acoustic Speed Estimation system on a single commodity microphone. We propose a novel Orthogonal Time-Delayed Multiplexing (OTDM) scheme for acoustic channel estimation at a high rate that was previously infeasible, making it possible to estimate high speeds. We then model the sound propagation from a unique perspective of the acoustic diffusion field, and infer the speed from the acoustic spatial distribution, a completely different way of thinking about speed estimation beyond prior DFS-based approaches. We further develop novel techniques for motion detection and signal enhancement to deliver a robust and practical system. We implement and evaluate ASE through extensive real-world experiments. Our results show that ASE reliably tracks walking speed, independently of target location and direction, with a mean error of 0.13 m/s, a reduction of 2.5x from DFS, and a detection rate of 97.4% for large coverage, e.g., free walking in a 4m x 4m room. We believe ASE pushes acoustic speed estimation beyond the conventional DFS-based paradigm and inspires exciting research in acoustic sensing.

Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Parallel generation makes them efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact, equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems (including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counting Hallucinations in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13080v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets, we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.</p></details> |  |

FramePack compresses input frame contexts with frame-wise importance so that more frames can be encoded within a fixed context length, with more important frames having longer contexts. The frame importance can be measured using time proximity, feature similarity, or hybrid metrics. The packing method allows for inference with thousands of frames and training with relatively large batch sizes. We also present drift prevention methods to address observation bias (error accumulation), including early-established endpoints, adjusted sampling orders, and discrete history representation. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the anti-drifting methods in both single-directional video streaming and bi-directional video generation. Finally, we show that existing video diffusion models can be finetuned with FramePack, and analyze the differences between different packing schedules.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack</p></details> |

Thus, an end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e., industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD) real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions, i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 page appendix</p></details> |

In the text-to-speech (TTS) task, current MLLM-based approaches rely on discrete token representations, which disregard the inherently continuous nature of speech and can lead to loss of fine-grained acoustic information.In this work, we investigate the TTS within the MLLM paradigm using continuous speech representations. We design a dual-head architecture and implement two complementary training strategies for a robust model. (1) A diffusion head generating continuous speech representations is added on the MLLM, which is on frame-level and strictly autoregressive. (2) The original language model head is retained to preserve multitask capability and to control the start and end of speech synthesis. (3) Masked training is employed to address exposure bias in autoregressive decoding. (4) To stabilize optimization, we propose a two-stage scheme where the LM is frozen in the second stage, ensuring the diffusion head learns from a fixed input distribution. Evaluations on LibriSpeech(PC) test-clean show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art autoregressive performance, with a WER of 1.95%, speaker similarity of 0.54, and UTMOS of 4.00. The two-stage training yields a 46% relative WER reduction over the one-stage training baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining autoregressive modeling with continuous-token diffusion, supported by a two-stage training procedure.</p></details> |  |

The central module, ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer, QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g., velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

At its core is a policy improvement objective that avoids the high variance of typical policy gradients and the complexity of backpropagation through time. This stable learning process is critically enabled by our second contribution: a robust distributional critic, which we design through a fusion of distributional RL and clipped double Q-learning. The resulting algorithm is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark of eighteen hard RL tasks, including Humanoid, Dog, and Shadow Hand domains, spanning both dense-reward and goal-conditioned RL scenarios. Beyond standard benchmarks, we also evaluate a biologically motivated predator-prey task to examine the behavioral robustness and generalization capacity of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[DogFit: Domain-guided Fine-tuning for Efficient Transfer Learning of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05685v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning of diffusion models to smaller target domains is challenging, as naively fine-tuning the model often results in poor generalization. Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering controllable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample diversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically requiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided Fine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion transfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional computational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the training loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the fine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation that during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger marginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable fidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength value as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning mechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the guidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies, i.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training stability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target domains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer learning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling TFLOPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review.

However, the conventional process for creating and animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming, requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here, we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model, MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to 360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of generated avatars compared to previous methods.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408 videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page with code: https://zhuang2002.github.io/FlashVSR</p></details> |

We introduce T(R,O) Grasp, a diffusion-based framework that efficiently generates accurate and diverse grasps across multiple robotic hands. At its core is the T(R,O) Graph, a unified representation that models spatial transformations between robotic hands and objects while encoding their geometric properties. A graph diffusion model, coupled with an efficient inverse kinematics solver, supports both unconditioned and conditioned grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of dexterous hands show that T(R,O) Grasp achieves average success rate of 94.83%, inference speed of 0.21s, and throughput of 41 grasps per second on an NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU, substantially outperforming existing baselines. In addition, our approach is robust and generalizable across embodiments while significantly reducing memory consumption. More importantly, the high inference speed enables closed-loop dexterous manipulation, underscoring the potential of T(R,O) Grasp to scale into a foundation model for dexterous grasping.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |

In this work, we propose a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM) from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image reconstruction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics-aware Diffusion Models for Planning and Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00236v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of generating dynamically admissible trajectories for control tasks using diffusion models, particularly in scenarios where the environment is complex and system dynamics are crucial for practical application. We propose a novel framework that integrates system dynamics directly into the diffusion model's denoising process through a sequential prediction and projection mechanism. This mechanism, aligned with the diffusion model's noising schedule, ensures generated trajectories are both consistent with expert demonstrations and adhere to underlying physical constraints. Notably, our approach can generate maximum likelihood trajectories and accurately recover trajectories generated by linear feedback controllers, even when explicit dynamics knowledge is unavailable. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on standard control tasks and a complex non-convex optimal control problem involving waypoint tracking and collision avoidance, demonstrating its potential for efficient trajectory generation in practical applications.

| **[Denoised Diffusion for Object-Focused Image Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08955v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small, occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds, environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios, bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[TreeDiffusion: Hierarchical Generative Clustering for Conditional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16910v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling and clustering are conventionally distinct tasks in machine learning. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been widely explored for their ability to integrate both, providing a framework for generative clustering. However, while VAEs can learn meaningful cluster representations in latent space, they often struggle to generate high-quality samples. This paper addresses this problem by introducing TreeDiffusion, a deep generative model that conditions diffusion models on learned latent hierarchical cluster representations from a VAE to obtain high-quality, cluster-specific generations. Our approach consists of two steps: first, a VAE-based clustering model learns a hierarchical latent representation of the data. Second, a cluster-aware diffusion model generates realistic images conditioned on the learned hierarchical structure. We systematically compare the generative capabilities of our approach with those of alternative conditioning strategies. Empirically, we demonstrate that conditioning diffusion models on hierarchical cluster representations improves the generative performance on real-world datasets compared to other approaches. Moreover, a key strength of our method lies in its ability to generate images that are both representative and specific to each cluster, enabling more detailed visualization of the learned latent structure. Our approach addresses the generative limitations of VAE-based clustering approaches by leveraging their learned structure, thereby advancing the field of generative clustering.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, accepted to ECML PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Go With the Flow: Fast Diffusion for Gaussian Mixture Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09059v6)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schrodinger Bridges (SBs) are diffusion processes that steer, in finite time, a given initial distribution to another final one while minimizing a suitable cost functional. Although various methods for computing SBs have recently been proposed in the literature, most of these approaches require computationally expensive training schemes, even for solving low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an analytic parametrization of a set of feasible policies for steering the distribution of a dynamical system from one Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to another. Instead of relying on standard non-convex optimization techniques, the optimal policy within the set can be approximated as the solution of a low-dimensional linear program whose dimension scales linearly with the number of components in each mixture. The proposed method generalizes naturally to more general classes of dynamical systems, such as controllable linear time-varying systems, enabling efficient solutions to multi-marginal momentum SBs between GMMs, a challenging distribution interpolation problem. We showcase the potential of this approach in low-to-moderate dimensional problems such as image-to-image translation in the latent space of an autoencoder, learning of cellular dynamics using multi-marginal momentum SBs, and various other examples. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/georgeRapa/GMMflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>NIPS ...</summary><p>NIPS 2025 (spotlight)</p></details> |

Unfortunately, predicting ECM remodeling under various chemical and mechanical conditions has proven to be excessively challenging, due in part to its complex regulation by intracellular and extracellular molecular reaction networks that are spatially and temporally dynamic. We introduce ECMSim, which is a highly interactive, real-time, and web application designed to simulate heterogeneous matrix remodeling. The current model simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a large-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis is a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim simulates over 1.3 million equations simultaneously in real time that include more than 125 species and more than 200 edges in each cell in a 100*100 spatial array (10,000 cells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, ECM production, and feedback loops, as well as molecular diffusion. The algorithm is represented by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on demand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The platform includes brush-style cell selection to target a subset of cells with adjustable input molecule concentrations, parameter sliders to adjust parameters on demand, and multiple coupled real-time visualizations of network dynamics at multiple scales. Implementing ECMSim in standard web technologies enables a fully functional application that combines real-time simulation, visual interaction, and model editing. The software enables the investigation of pathological or experimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the testing of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unconditional Human Motion and Shape Generation via Balanced Score-Based Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12537v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2 score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in isolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion for Computing Unsigned Distance Fields from Unoriented Points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12524v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD), for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF. Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces, as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining computationally efficient and stable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlling Intent Expressiveness in Robot Motion with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12370v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legibility of robot motion is critical in human-robot interaction, as it allows humans to quickly infer a robot's intended goal. Although traditional trajectory generation methods typically prioritize efficiency, they often fail to make the robot's intentions clear to humans. Meanwhile, existing approaches to legible motion usually produce only a single "most legible" trajectory, overlooking the need to modulate intent expressiveness in different contexts. In this work, we propose a novel motion generation framework that enables controllable legibility across the full spectrum, from highly legible to highly ambiguous motions. We introduce a modeling approach based on an Information Potential Field to assign continuous legibility scores to trajectories, and build upon it with a two-stage diffusion framework that first generates paths at specified legibility levels and then translates them into executable robot actions. Experiments in both 2D and 3D reaching tasks demonstrate that our approach produces diverse and controllable motions with varying degrees of legibility, while achieving performance comparable to SOTA.

| **[Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization for Memory-efficient RL of Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11683v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance. Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks. Our codes and models are available at \href{https://github.com/THU-KEG/BGPO}{https://github.com/THU-KEG/BGPO}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully mixed virtual element schemes for steady-state poroelastic stress-assisted diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12307v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a fully mixed virtual element method for the numerical approximation of the coupling between stress-altered diffusion and linear elasticity equations with strong symmetry of total poroelastic stress (using the Hellinger--Reissner principle). A novelty of this work is that we introduce a less restrictive assumption on the stress-assisted diffusion coefficient, requiring an analysis of the perturbed diffusion equation using Banach spaces. The solvability of the continuous and discrete problems is established using a suitable modification of the abstract theory for perturbed saddle-point problems in Banach spaces (which is in itself a new result of independent interest). In addition, we establish optimal a priori error estimates. The method and its analysis are robust with respect to the poromechanical parameters. We also include a number of numerical examples that illustrate the properties of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPEED: Scalable, Precise, and Efficient Concept Erasure for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07392v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Erasing concepts from large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has become increasingly crucial due to the growing concerns over copyright infringement, offensive content, and privacy violations. In scalable applications, fine-tuning-based methods are time-consuming to precisely erase multiple target concepts, while real-time editing-based methods often degrade the generation quality of non-target concepts due to conflicting optimization objectives. To address this dilemma, we introduce SPEED, an efficient concept erasure approach that directly edits model parameters. SPEED searches for a null space, a model editing space where parameter updates do not affect non-target concepts, to achieve scalable and precise erasure. To facilitate accurate null space optimization, we incorporate three complementary strategies: Influence-based Prior Filtering (IPF) to selectively retain the most affected non-target concepts, Directed Prior Augmentation (DPA) to enrich the filtered retain set with semantically consistent variations, and Invariant Equality Constraints (IEC) to preserve key invariants during the T2I generation process. Extensive evaluations across multiple concept erasure tasks demonstrate that SPEED consistently outperforms existing methods in non-target preservation while achieving efficient and high-fidelity concept erasure, successfully erasing 100 concepts within only 5 seconds. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/Ouxiang-Li/SPEED.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version has been temporarily withdrawn for procedural review purposes.

This survey delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field. We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[A Gradient Guided Diffusion Framework for Chance Constrained Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12238v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chance constrained programming (CCP) is a powerful framework for addressing optimization problems under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a novel Gradient-Guided Diffusion-based Optimization framework, termed GGDOpt, which tackles CCP through three key innovations. First, GGDOpt accommodates a broad class of CCP problems without requiring the knowledge of the exact distribution of uncertainty-relying solely on a set of samples. Second, to address the nonconvexity of the chance constraints, it reformulates the CCP as a sampling problem over the product of two distributions: an unknown data distribution supported on a nonconvex set and a Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective function, which fully leverages both first- and second-order gradient information. Third, GGDOpt has theoretical convergence guarantees and provides practical error bounds under mild assumptions. By progressively injecting noise during the forward diffusion process to convexify the nonconvex feasible region, GGDOpt enables guided reverse sampling to generate asymptotically optimal solutions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and a waveform design task in wireless communications demonstrate that GGDOpt outperforms existing methods in both solution quality and stability with nearly 80% overhead reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion: Fast Generation with Interpretable Diffusion Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12220v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories. Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image synthesis in generative modeling.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
