| **[Reangle-A-Video: 4D Video Generation as Video-to-Video Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09151v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized multi-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data.

| **[Frame-wise Conditioning Adaptation for Fine-Tuning Diffusion Models in Text-to-Video Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12953v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-video prediction (TVP) is a downstream video generation task that requires a model to produce subsequent video frames given a series of initial video frames and text describing the required motion. In practice TVP methods focus on a particular category of videos depicting manipulations of objects carried out by human beings or robot arms. Previous methods adapt models pre-trained on text-to-image tasks, and thus tend to generate video that lacks the required continuity. A natural progression would be to leverage more recent pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) models. This approach is rendered more challenging by the fact that the most common fine-tuning technique, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), yields undesirable results. In this work, we propose an adaptation-based strategy we label Frame-wise Conditioning Adaptation (FCA). Within the module, we devise a sub-module that produces frame-wise text embeddings from the input text, which acts as an additional text condition to aid generation. We use FCA to fine-tune the T2V model, which incorporates the initial frame(s) as an extra condition. We compare and discuss the more effective strategy for injecting such embeddings into the T2V model. We conduct extensive ablation studies on our design choices with quantitative and qualitative performance analysis. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art for the task of TVP.

| **[Other Vehicle Trajectories Are Also Needed: A Driving World Model Unifies Ego-Other Vehicle Trajectories in Video Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09215v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving World Model named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[AUTV: Creating Underwater Video Datasets with Pixel-wise Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12828v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater video analysis, hampered by the dynamic marine environment and camera motion, remains a challenging task in computer vision. Existing training-free video generation techniques, learning motion dynamics on the frame-by-frame basis, often produce poor results with noticeable motion interruptions and misaligments. To address these issues, we propose AUTV, a framework for synthesizing marine video data with pixel-wise annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by constructing two video datasets, namely UTV, a real-world dataset comprising 2,000 video-text pairs, and SUTV, a synthetic video dataset including 10,000 videos with segmentation masks for marine objects. UTV provides diverse underwater videos with comprehensive annotations including appearance, texture, camera intrinsics, lighting, and animal behavior. SUTV can be used to improve underwater downstream tasks, which are demonstrated in video inpainting and video object segmentation.</p></details> | under review |
| **[A Survey of State of the Art Large Vision Language Models: Alignment, Benchmark, Evaluations and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02189v5)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a transformative technology at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, enabling machines to perceive and reason about the world through both visual and textual modalities. For example, models such as CLIP, Claude, and GPT-4V demonstrate strong reasoning and understanding abilities on visual and textual data and beat classical single modality vision models on zero-shot classification. Despite their rapid advancements in research and growing popularity in applications, a comprehensive survey of existing studies on VLMs is notably lacking, particularly for researchers aiming to leverage VLMs in their specific domains. To this end, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs in the following aspects: model information of the major VLMs developed over the past five years (2019-2024); the main architectures and training methods of these VLMs; summary and categorization of the popular benchmarks and evaluation metrics of VLMs; the applications of VLMs including embodied agents, robotics, and video generation; the challenges and issues faced by current VLMs such as hallucination, fairness, and safety.

| **[Video Super-Resolution: All You Need is a Video Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03355v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a generic video super-resolution algorithm in this paper, based on the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework with an unconditional video generation model in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method has strong capabilities to address video super-resolution challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |
| **[SPC-GS: Gaussian Splatting with Semantic-Prompt Consistency for Indoor Open-World Free-view Synthesis from Sparse Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12535v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting-based indoor open-world free-view synthesis approaches have shown significant performance with dense input images. However, they exhibit poor performance when confronted with sparse inputs, primarily due to the sparse distribution of Gaussian points and insufficient view supervision. To relieve these challenges, we propose SPC-GS, leveraging Scene-layout-based Gaussian Initialization (SGI) and Semantic-Prompt Consistency (SPC) Regularization for open-world free view synthesis with sparse inputs. Specifically, SGI provides a dense, scene-layout-based Gaussian distribution by utilizing view-changed images generated from the video generation model and view-constraint Gaussian points densification. Additionally, SPC mitigates limited view supervision by employing semantic-prompt-based consistency constraints developed by SAM2. This approach leverages available semantics from training views, serving as instructive prompts, to optimize visually overlapping regions in novel views with 2D and 3D consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SPC-GS across Replica and ScanNet benchmarks. Notably, our SPC-GS achieves a 3.06 dB gain in PSNR for reconstruction quality and a 7.3% improvement in mIoU for open-world semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025.

| **[VMBench: A Benchmark for Perception-Aligned Video Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10076v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has advanced rapidly, improving evaluation methods, yet assessing video's motion remains a major challenge. Specifically, there are two key issues: 1) current motion metrics do not fully align with human perceptions; 2) the existing motion prompts are limited. Based on these findings, we introduce VMBench--a comprehensive Video Motion Benchmark that has perception-aligned motion metrics and features the most diverse types of motion. VMBench has several appealing properties: 1) Perception-Driven Motion Evaluation Metrics, we identify five dimensions based on human perception in motion video assessment and develop fine-grained evaluation metrics, providing deeper insights into models' strengths and weaknesses in motion quality. 2) Meta-Guided Motion Prompt Generation, a structured method that extracts meta-information, generates diverse motion prompts with LLMs, and refines them through human-AI validation, resulting in a multi-level prompt library covering six key dynamic scene dimensions. 3) Human-Aligned Validation Mechanism, we provide human preference annotations to validate our benchmarks, with our metrics achieving an average 35.3% improvement in Spearman's correlation over baseline methods. This is the first time that the quality of motion in videos has been evaluated from the perspective of human perception alignment. Additionally, we will soon release VMBench at https://github.com/GD-AIGC/VMBench, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing motion generation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PersonalVideo: High ID-Fidelity Video Customization without Dynamic and Semantic Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17048v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current text-to-video (T2V) generation has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic general videos, but it is still under-explored in identity-specific human video generation with customized ID images. The key challenge lies in maintaining high ID fidelity consistently while preserving the original motion dynamic and semantic following after the identity injection. Current video identity customization methods mainly rely on reconstructing given identity images on text-to-image models, which have a divergent distribution with the T2V model. This process introduces a tuning-inference gap, leading to dynamic and semantic degradation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework, dubbed $\textbf{PersonalVideo}$, that applies a mixture of reward supervision on synthesized videos instead of the simple reconstruction objective on images. Specifically, we first incorporate identity consistency reward to effectively inject the reference's identity without the tuning-inference gap. Then we propose a novel semantic consistency reward to align the semantic distribution of the generated videos with the original T2V model, which preserves its dynamic and semantic following capability during the identity injection. With the non-reconstructive reward training, we further employ simulated prompt augmentation to reduce overfitting by supervising generated results in more semantic scenarios, gaining good robustness even with only a single reference image. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in delivering high identity faithfulness while preserving the inherent video generation qualities of the original T2V model, outshining prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pyramidal Flow Matching for Efficient Video Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05954v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation requires modeling a vast spatiotemporal space, which demands significant computational resources and data usage. To reduce the complexity, the prevailing approaches employ a cascaded architecture to avoid direct training with full resolution latent. Despite reducing computational demands, the separate optimization of each sub-stage hinders knowledge sharing and sacrifices flexibility. This work introduces a unified pyramidal flow matching algorithm. It reinterprets the original denoising trajectory as a series of pyramid stages, where only the final stage operates at the full resolution, thereby enabling more efficient video generative modeling. Through our sophisticated design, the flows of different pyramid stages can be interlinked to maintain continuity. Moreover, we craft autoregressive video generation with a temporal pyramid to compress the full-resolution history. The entire framework can be optimized in an end-to-end manner and with a single unified Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method supports generating high-quality 5-second (up to 10-second) videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS within 20.7k A100 GPU training hours. All code and models are open-sourced at https://pyramid-flow.github.io.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[A Speech-to-Video Synthesis Approach Using Spatio-Temporal Diffusion for Vocal Tract MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12102v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between vocal tract motion during speech and the resulting acoustic signal is crucial for aided clinical assessment and developing personalized treatment and rehabilitation strategies. Toward this goal, we introduce an audio-to-video generation framework for creating Real Time/cine-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (RT-/cine-MRI) visuals of the vocal tract from speech signals. Our framework first preprocesses RT-/cine-MRI sequences and speech samples to achieve temporal alignment, ensuring synchronization between visual and audio data. We then employ a modified stable diffusion model, integrating structural and temporal blocks, to effectively capture movement characteristics and temporal dynamics in the synchronized data. This process enables the generation of MRI sequences from new speech inputs, improving the conversion of audio into visual data. We evaluated our framework on healthy controls and tongue cancer patients by analyzing and comparing the vocal tract movements in synthesized videos. Our framework demonstrated adaptability to new speech inputs and effective generalization. In addition, positive human evaluations confirmed its effectiveness, with realistic and accurate visualizations, suggesting its potential for outpatient therapy and personalized simulation of vocal tract visualizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SteerX: Creating Any Camera-Free 3D and 4D Scenes with Geometric Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12024v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in 3D/4D scene generation emphasizes the importance of physical alignment throughout video generation and scene reconstruction. However, existing methods improve the alignment separately at each stage, making it difficult to manage subtle misalignments arising from another stage. Here, we present SteerX, a zero-shot inference-time steering method that unifies scene reconstruction into the generation process, tilting data distributions toward better geometric alignment. To this end, we introduce two geometric reward functions for 3D/4D scene generation by using pose-free feed-forward scene reconstruction models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SteerX in improving 3D/4D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://byeongjun-park.github.io/SteerX/</p></details> |
| **[WonderVerse: Extendable 3D Scene Generation with Video Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09160v3)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce \textit{WonderVerse}, a simple but effective framework for generating extendable 3D scenes. Unlike existing methods that rely on iterative depth estimation and image inpainting, often leading to geometric distortions and inconsistencies, WonderVerse leverages the powerful world-level priors embedded within video generative foundation models to create highly immersive and geometrically coherent 3D environments. Furthermore, we propose a new technique for controllable 3D scene extension to substantially increase the scale of the generated environments. Besides, we introduce a novel abnormal sequence detection module that utilizes camera trajectory to address geometric inconsistency in the generated videos. Finally, WonderVerse is compatible with various 3D reconstruction methods, allowing both efficient and high-quality generation. Extensive experiments on 3D scene generation demonstrate that our WonderVerse, with an elegant and simple pipeline, delivers extendable and highly-realistic 3D scenes, markedly outperforming existing works that rely on more complex architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Watermarking Using Generative Priors Against Image Editing: From Benchmarking to Advances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18775v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current image watermarking methods are vulnerable to advanced image editing techniques enabled by large-scale text-to-image models. These models can distort embedded watermarks during editing, posing significant challenges to copyright protection. In this work, we introduce W-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of watermarking methods against a wide range of image editing techniques, including image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation. Through extensive evaluations of eleven representative watermarking methods against prevalent editing techniques, we demonstrate that most methods fail to detect watermarks after such edits. To address this limitation, we propose VINE, a watermarking method that significantly enhances robustness against various image editing techniques while maintaining high image quality. Our approach involves two key innovations: (1) we analyze the frequency characteristics of image editing and identify that blurring distortions exhibit similar frequency properties, which allows us to use them as surrogate attacks during training to bolster watermark robustness; (2) we leverage a large-scale pretrained diffusion model SDXL-Turbo, adapting it for the watermarking task to achieve more imperceptible and robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that our method achieves outstanding watermarking performance under various image editing techniques, outperforming existing methods in both image quality and robustness.

| **[ReCamMaster: Camera-Controlled Generative Rendering from A Single Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11647v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera control has been actively studied in text or image conditioned video generation tasks. However, altering camera trajectories of a given video remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation. It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories. The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video conditioning mechanism -- its capability often overlooked in current research. To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5, which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics, covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments tell that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines. Our method also finds promising applications in video stabilization, super-resolution, and outpainting.

| **[HiTVideo: Hierarchical Tokenizers for Enhancing Text-to-Video Generation with Autoregressive Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11513v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generation poses significant challenges due to the inherent complexity of video data, which spans both temporal and spatial dimensions. It introduces additional redundancy, abrupt variations, and a domain gap between language and vision tokens while generation. Addressing these challenges requires an effective video tokenizer that can efficiently encode video data while preserving essential semantic and spatiotemporal information, serving as a critical bridge between text and vision. Inspired by the observation in VQ-VAE-2 and workflows of traditional animation, we propose HiTVideo for text-to-video generation with hierarchical tokenizers. It utilizes a 3D causal VAE with a multi-layer discrete token framework, encoding video content into hierarchically structured codebooks. Higher layers capture semantic information with higher compression, while lower layers focus on fine-grained spatiotemporal details, striking a balance between compression efficiency and reconstruction quality. Our approach efficiently encodes longer video sequences (e.g., 8 seconds, 64 frames), reducing bits per pixel (bpp) by approximately 70\% compared to baseline tokenizers, while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. We explore the trade-offs between compression and reconstruction, while emphasizing the advantages of high-compressed semantic tokens in text-to-video tasks. HiTVideo aims to address the potential limitations of existing video tokenizers in text-to-video generation tasks, striving for higher compression ratios and simplify LLMs modeling under language guidance, offering a scalable and promising framework for advancing text to video generation.

Current datasets, such as Ego4D, often suffer from inconsistent view perspectives and misaligned interactions, leading to reduced video quality and limiting their applicability for precise imitation learning tasks. Towards this end, we introduce TASTE-Rob -- a pioneering large-scale dataset of 100,856 ego-centric hand-object interaction videos. Each video is meticulously aligned with language instructions and recorded from a consistent camera viewpoint to ensure interaction clarity. By fine-tuning a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) on TASTE-Rob, we achieve realistic object interactions, though we observed occasional inconsistencies in hand grasping postures. To enhance realism, we introduce a three-stage pose-refinement pipeline that improves hand posture accuracy in generated videos. Our curated dataset, coupled with the specialized pose-refinement framework, provides notable performance gains in generating high-quality, task-oriented hand-object interaction videos, resulting in achieving superior generalizable robotic manipulation. The TASTE-Rob dataset will be made publicly available upon publication to foster further advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025</p></details> |

The advent of powerful text-to-video diffusion models has opened a promising pathway for music-video (MV) generation by first addressing the music-to-MV description task and subsequently leveraging these models for video generation. In this study, we focus on the MV description generation task and propose a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training data construction and multimodal model fine-tuning. We fine-tune existing pre-trained multimodal models on our newly constructed music-to-MV description dataset based on the Music4All dataset, which integrates both musical and visual information. Our experimental results demonstrate that music representations can be effectively mapped to textual domains, enabling the generation of meaningful MV description directly from music inputs. We also identify key components in the dataset construction pipeline that critically impact the quality of MV description and highlight specific musical attributes that warrant greater focus for improved MV description generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RepL4NLP 2025 @ NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[SAFREE: Training-Free and Adaptive Guard for Safe Text-to-Image And Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12761v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly enhanced their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, but they have also increased the risk of producing unsafe content. Existing unlearning/editing-based methods for safe generation remove harmful concepts from models but face several challenges: (1) They cannot instantly remove harmful concepts without training. (2) Their safe generation capabilities depend on collected training data. (3) They alter model weights, risking degradation in quality for content unrelated to toxic concepts. To address these, we propose SAFREE, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I and T2V, that does not alter the model's weights. Specifically, we detect a subspace corresponding to a set of toxic concepts in the text embedding space and steer prompt embeddings away from this subspace, thereby filtering out harmful content while preserving intended semantics. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving safe concepts, SAFREE incorporates a novel self-validating filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the denoising steps when applying the filtered embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate adaptive re-attention mechanisms within the diffusion latent space to selectively diminish the influence of features related to toxic concepts at the pixel level. In the end, SAFREE ensures coherent safety checking, preserving the fidelity, quality, and safety of the output. SAFREE achieves SOTA performance in suppressing unsafe content in T2I generation compared to training-free baselines and effectively filters targeted concepts while maintaining high-quality images. It also shows competitive results against training-based methods. We extend SAFREE to various T2I backbones and T2V tasks, showcasing its flexibility and generalization. SAFREE provides a robust and adaptable safeguard for ensuring safe visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; The first two authors contributed equally; Project page: https://safree-safe-t2i-t2v.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Tora: Trajectory-oriented Diffusion Transformer for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21705v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in producing high-quality video content. Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor (TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser (MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D motion compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tora excels in achieving high motion fidelity compared to the foundational DiT model, while also accurately simulating the complex movements of the physical world.

| **[FlashVideo: Flowing Fidelity to Detail for Efficient High-Resolution Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05179v3)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DiT diffusion models have achieved great success in text-to-video generation, leveraging their scalability in model capacity and data scale. High content and motion fidelity aligned with text prompts, however, often require large model parameters and a substantial number of function evaluations (NFEs). Realistic and visually appealing details are typically reflected in high resolution outputs, further amplifying computational demands especially for single stage DiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two stage framework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs across stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage, prompt fidelity is prioritized through a low resolution generation process utilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational efficiency. The second stage establishes flow matching between low and high resolutions, effectively generating fine details with minimal NFEs. Quantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves state-of-the-art high resolution video generation with superior computational efficiency. Additionally, the two-stage design enables users to preview the initial output and accordingly adjust the prompt before committing to full-resolution generation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs and wait times as well as enhancing commercial viability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Model...</summary><p>Model and Weight: https://github.com/FoundationVision/FlashVideo</p></details> |
| **[ClassDiffusion: More Aligned Personalization Tuning with Explicit Class Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17532v3)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-image customization works have proven successful in generating images of given concepts by fine-tuning diffusion models on a few examples. However, tuning-based methods inherently tend to overfit the concepts, resulting in failure to create the concept under multiple conditions (*e.g.*, headphone is missing when generating "a `dog wearing a headphone"). Interestingly, we notice that the base model before fine-tuning exhibits the capability to compose the base concept with other elements (*e.g.*, "a dog wearing a headphone"), implying that the compositional ability only disappears after personalization tuning. We observe a semantic shift in the customized concept after fine-tuning, indicating that the personalized concept is not aligned with the original concept, and further show through theoretical analyses that this semantic shift leads to increased difficulty in sampling the joint conditional probability distribution, resulting in the loss of the compositional ability. Inspired by this finding, we present **ClassDiffusion**, a technique that leverages a **semantic preservation loss** to explicitly regulate the concept space when learning a new concept. Although simple, this approach effectively prevents semantic drift during the fine-tuning process of the target concepts.

However, these models often struggle with basic image transformations. This paper investigates the image-level understanding of VLMs, specifically CLIP by OpenAI and SigLIP by Google. Our findings reveal that these models lack comprehension of multiple image-level augmentations. To facilitate this study, we created an augmented version of the Flickr8k dataset, pairing each image with a detailed description of the applied transformation. We further explore how this deficiency impacts downstream tasks, particularly in image editing, and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art Image2Image models on simple transformations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 15 images |

Given the scarcity of available datasets with motion attribute annotations, existing methods struggle to generalize well in this task. In our work, the text input allows us to tap into the power of modern-day diffusion models to generate plausible motion samples for the right object category and part. In turn, the input 3D object provides image prompting to personalize the generated video to that very object we wish to articulate. Our method starts with a few-shot finetuning for category-specific motion generation, a key first step to compensate for the lack of articulation awareness by current diffusion models. For this, we finetune a pre-trained multi-view image generation model for controllable multi-view video generation, using a small collection of video samples obtained for the target object category. This is followed by motion video personalization that is realized by multi-view rendered images of the target 3D object. At last, we transfer the personalized video motion to the target 3D object via differentiable rendering to optimize part motion parameters by a score distillation sampling loss. Experimental results on PartNet-Sapien and ACD datasets show that our method is capable of generating realistic motion videos and predicting 3D motion parameters in a more accurate and generalizable way, compared to prior works in the few-shot setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 16 pages</p></details> |

Existing models, however, lack control of camera pose that serves as a cinematic language to express deeper narrative nuances. To alleviate this issue, we introduce CameraCtrl, enabling accurate camera pose control for video diffusion models. Our approach explores effective camera trajectory parameterization along with a plug-and-play camera pose control module that is trained on top of a video diffusion model, leaving other modules of the base model untouched. Moreover, a comprehensive study on the effect of various training datasets is conducted, suggesting that videos with diverse camera distributions and similar appearance to the base model indeed enhance controllability and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CameraCtrl in achieving precise camera control with different video generation models, marking a step forward in the pursuit of dynamic and customized video storytelling from textual and camera pose inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hehao13.github.io/projects-CameraCtrl/ Code: https://github.com/hehao13/CameraCtrl</p></details> |

Previous camera-conditioned video generative models suffer from diminished video dynamics and limited range of viewpoints when generating videos with large camera movement. We take an approach that progressively expands the generation of dynamic scenes -- first enhancing dynamic content within individual video clip, then extending this capability to create seamless explorations across broad viewpoint ranges. Specifically, we construct a dataset featuring a large degree of dynamics with camera parameter annotations for training while designing a lightweight camera injection module and training scheme to preserve dynamics of the pretrained models. Building on these improved single-clip techniques, we enable extended scene exploration by allowing users to iteratively specify camera trajectories for generating coherent video sequences. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that CameraCtrl Ii enables camera-controlled dynamic scene synthesis with substantially wider spatial exploration than previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hehao13.github.io/Projects-CameraCtrl-II/</p></details> |
| **[Long Context Tuning for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10589v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation can produce realistic, minute-long single-shot videos with scalable diffusion transformers. However, real-world narrative videos require multi-shot scenes with visual and dynamic consistency across shots. In this work, we introduce Long Context Tuning (LCT), a training paradigm that expands the context window of pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models to learn scene-level consistency directly from data. Our method expands full attention mechanisms from individual shots to encompass all shots within a scene, incorporating interleaved 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy, enabling both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. Models with bidirectional attention after LCT can further be fine-tuned with context-causal attention, facilitating auto-regressive generation with efficient KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate single-shot models after LCT can produce coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibit emerging capabilities, including compositional generation and interactive shot extension, paving the way for more practical visual content creation.

By introducing a block-wise autoregressive unit, ACDiT offers a flexible interpolation between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion, bypassing the limitations of discrete tokenization. The generation of each block is formulated as a conditional diffusion process, conditioned on prior blocks. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) on standard diffusion transformer during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We show that ACDiT performs best among all autoregressive baselines under similar model scales on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefiting from autoregressive modeling, pretrained ACDiT can be transferred in visual understanding tasks despite being trained with the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. We hope that ACDiT offers a novel perspective on visual autoregressive generation and unlocks new avenues for unified models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CINEMA: Coherent Multi-Subject Video Generation via MLLM-Based Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10391v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of deep generative models, particularly diffusion models. While existing methods excel in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or single images, personalized multi-subject video generation remains a largely unexplored challenge. This task involves synthesizing videos that incorporate multiple distinct subjects, each defined by separate reference images, while ensuring temporal and spatial consistency. Current approaches primarily rely on mapping subject images to keywords in text prompts, which introduces ambiguity and limits their ability to model subject relationships effectively. In this paper, we propose CINEMA, a novel framework for coherent multi-subject video generation by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach eliminates the need for explicit correspondences between subject images and text entities, mitigating ambiguity and reducing annotation effort. By leveraging MLLM to interpret subject relationships, our method facilitates scalability, enabling the use of large and diverse datasets for training. Furthermore, our framework can be conditioned on varying numbers of subjects, offering greater flexibility in personalized content creation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves subject consistency, and overall video coherence, paving the way for advanced applications in storytelling, interactive media, and personalized video generation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce the first application of a pretrained transformer-based video generative model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and generates highly dynamic, realistic videos for portrait animation, effectively addressing these challenges. The adoption of a new video backbone model makes previous U-Net-based methods for identity maintenance, audio conditioning, and video extrapolation inapplicable. To address this limitation, we design an identity reference network consisting of a causal 3D VAE combined with a stacked series of transformer layers, ensuring consistent facial identity across video sequences. Additionally, we investigate various speech audio conditioning and motion frame mechanisms to enable the generation of continuous video driven by speech audio. Our method is validated through experiments on benchmark and newly proposed wild datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods in generating realistic portraits characterized by diverse orientations within dynamic and immersive scenes. Further visualizations and the source code are available at: https://fudan-generative-vision.github.io/hallo3/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Latent Motion for Portrait Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10096v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in portrait video generation have been noteworthy. However, existing methods rely heavily on human priors and pre-trained generation models, which may introduce unrealistic motion and lead to inefficient inference. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Latent Motion (SeMo), a compact and expressive motion representation. Leveraging this representation, our approach achieve both high-quality visual results and efficient inference. SeMo follows an effective three-step framework: Abstraction, Reasoning, and Generation. First, in the Abstraction step, we use a carefully designed Mask Motion Encoder to compress the subject's motion state into a compact and abstract latent motion (1D token). Second, in the Reasoning step, long-term modeling and efficient reasoning are performed in this latent space to generate motion sequences. Finally, in the Generation step, the motion dynamics serve as conditional information to guide the generation model in synthesizing realistic transitions from reference frames to target frames. Thanks to the compact and descriptive nature of Semantic Latent Motion, our method enables real-time video generation with highly realistic motion. User studies demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models with an 81% win rate in realism. Extensive experiments further highlight its strong compression capability, reconstruction quality, and generative potential. Moreover, its fully self-supervised nature suggests promising applications in broader video generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[UVE: Are MLLMs Unified Evaluators for AI-Generated Videos?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09949v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of video generative models (VGMs), it is essential to develop reliable and comprehensive automatic metrics for AI-generated videos (AIGVs). Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 16 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.

| **[VideoMerge: Towards Training-free Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09926v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video generation remains a challenging and compelling topic in computer vision. Diffusion based models, among the various approaches to video generation, have achieved state of the art quality with their iterative denoising procedures. However, the intrinsic complexity of the video domain renders the training of such diffusion models exceedingly expensive in terms of both data curation and computational resources. Moreover, these models typically operate on a fixed noise tensor that represents the video, resulting in predetermined spatial and temporal dimensions. Although several high quality open-source pretrained video diffusion models, jointly trained on images and videos of varying lengths and resolutions, are available, it is generally not recommended to specify a video length at inference that was not included in the training set. Consequently, these models are not readily adaptable to the direct generation of longer videos by merely increasing the specified video length. In addition to feasibility challenges, long-video generation also encounters quality issues. The domain of long videos is inherently more complex than that of short videos: extended durations introduce greater variability and necessitate long-range temporal consistency, thereby increasing the overall difficulty of the task. We propose VideoMerge, a training-free method that can be seamlessly adapted to merge short videos generated by pretrained text-to-video diffusion model. Our approach preserves the model's original expressiveness and consistency while allowing for extended duration and dynamic variation as specified by the user. By leveraging the strengths of pretrained models, our method addresses challenges related to smoothness, consistency, and dynamic content through orthogonal strategies that operate collaboratively to achieve superior quality.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in image and video synthesis using diffusion models, producing high-quality stereo videos remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of maintaining consistent temporal and spatial coherence between left and right views. We introduce StereoCrafter-Zero, a novel framework for zero-shot stereo video generation that leverages video diffusion priors without requiring paired training data. Our key innovations include a noisy restart strategy to initialize stereo-aware latent representations and an iterative refinement process that progressively harmonizes the latent space, addressing issues like temporal flickering and view inconsistencies. In addition, we propose the use of dissolved depth maps to streamline latent space operations by reducing high-frequency depth information. Our comprehensive evaluations, including quantitative metrics and user studies, demonstrate that StereoCrafter-Zero produces high-quality stereo videos with enhanced depth consistency and temporal smoothness, even when depth estimations are imperfect. Our framework is robust and adaptable across various diffusion models, setting a new benchmark for zero-shot stereo video generation and enabling more immersive visual experiences. Our code is in https://github.com/shijianjian/StereoCrafter-Zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Diffusability of Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14831v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for generating high-quality images and videos, utilizing compressed latent representations to reduce the computational burden of the diffusion process. While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K 256x256 and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 17x256x256.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 22 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

While prior works use large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rewards, these approaches are largely limited to simple tasks with well-defined rewards, such as pick-and-place. This limitation arises because LLMs struggle to interpret complex scenes compressed into text or code due to their restricted input modality, while VLM-based rewards, though better at visual perception, remain limited by their less expressive output modality. To address these challenges, we leverage the imagination capability of general-purpose video generation models. Given an initial simulation frame and a textual task description, the video generation model produces a video demonstrating task completion with correct semantics. We then extract rich supervisory signals from the generated video, including 6D object pose sequences, 2D segmentations, and estimated depth, to facilitate task learning in simulation. Our approach significantly improves supervision quality for complex embodied tasks, enabling large-scale training in simulators.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines the precision of a computer graphics pipeline, enabling accurate control over elements such as camera movement, object rotation, and character animation, with the visual fidelity of generative AI to produce high-quality videos from coarsely rendered inputs. To support animations with any initial start point and extended sequences, we adopt a two-stage generation process guided by 3D geometry: 1) 3D-Guided Keyframe Generation, where a customized image diffusion model refines rendered keyframes to ensure consistency and quality, and 2) 3D-Guided Video Interpolation, a training-free approach that generates smooth, high-quality video frames between keyframes using bidirectional guidance. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our framework in producing controllable, high-quality animations from single input images by harmonizing 3D geometry with generative models.

This work studies the process of post-training these models for accurate world modeling through the lens of the simple, yet fundamental, physics task of modeling object freefall. We show state-of-the-art video generation models struggle with this basic task, despite their visually impressive outputs. To remedy this problem, we find that fine-tuning on a relatively small amount of simulated videos is effective in inducing the dropping behavior in the model, and we can further improve results through a novel reward modeling procedure we introduce. Our study also reveals key limitations of post-training in generalization and distribution modeling. Additionally, we release a benchmark for this task that may serve as a useful diagnostic tool for tracking physical accuracy in large-scale video generative model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion Sampling via Exploiting Local Transition Coherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09675v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in generating high-quality images and videos from textual descriptions. However, the lengthy sampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in practical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical relationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity between them, which often only works with specific network structures. To address this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the transition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the outputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on the network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel training-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified relationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent steps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure, LTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to almost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with them. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up sampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining competitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of 1.67-fold in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55-fold in video generation models. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable 10-fold speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than 16FPS.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce MaskFlow, a unified video generation framework that combines discrete representations with flow-matching to enable efficient generation of high-quality long videos. By leveraging a frame-level masking strategy during training, MaskFlow conditions on previously generated unmasked frames to generate videos with lengths ten times beyond that of the training sequences. MaskFlow does so very efficiently by enabling the use of fast Masked Generative Model (MGM)-style sampling and can be deployed in both fully autoregressive as well as full-sequence generation modes. We validate the quality of our method on the FaceForensics (FFS) and Deepmind Lab (DMLab) datasets and report Frechet Video Distance (FVD) competitive with state-of-the-art approaches.

However, theoretical analyses of these models remain scant. In this work, we develop theoretical underpinnings for these models and use our insights to improve the performance of existing models. We first develop Meta-ARVDM, a unified framework of ARVDMs that subsumes most existing methods. Using Meta-ARVDM, we analyze the KL-divergence between the videos generated by Meta-ARVDM and the true videos. Our analysis uncovers two important phenomena inherent to ARVDM -- error accumulation and memory bottleneck. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility result, we show that the memory bottleneck phenomenon cannot be avoided. To mitigate the memory bottleneck, we design various network structures to explicitly use more past frames. We also achieve a significantly improved trade-off between the mitigation of the memory bottleneck and the inference efficiency by compressing the frames. Experimental results on DMLab and Minecraft validate the efficacy of our methods. Our experiments also demonstrate a Pareto-frontier between the error accumulation and memory bottleneck across different methods.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, recent advancements have focused on video generation, which has gained significant attention due to the impressive success of diffusion models. However, these models require substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a world model leveraging object-centric representation space using slot attention, guided by language instructions. Our model perceives the current state as an object-centric representation and predicts future states in this representation space conditioned on natural language instructions. This approach results in a more compact and computationally efficient model compared to diffusion-based generative alternatives. Furthermore, it flexibly predicts future states based on language instructions, and offers a significant advantage in manipulation tasks where object recognition is crucial. In this paper, we demonstrate that our latent predictive world model surpasses generative world models in visuo-linguo-motor control tasks, achieving superior sample and computation efficiency. We also investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method and explore various strategies for predicting actions using object-centric representations.</p></details> |  |

Incorporating learnable task embeddings brings multiple dense prediction tasks into a single model, enhancing flexibility and further boosting performance. We further propose a large-scale dense prediction video dataset~\datasetname, addressing the issue that existing datasets do not concurrently contain captions, videos, segmentation, or depth maps. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of our method, surpassing the state-of-the-art in terms of video quality, consistency, and motion smoothness.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

However, current video editing methods still suffer from several challenges. Inversion-based methods, though training-free and flexible, are time-consuming during inference, struggle with fine-grained editing instructions, and produce artifacts and jitter. On the other hand, end-to-end methods, which rely on edited video pairs for training, offer faster inference speeds but often produce poor editing results due to a lack of high-quality training video pairs. In this paper, to close the gap in end-to-end methods, we introduce Se\~norita-2M, a high-quality video editing dataset. Se\~norita-2M consists of approximately 2 millions of video editing pairs. It is built by crafting four high-quality, specialized video editing models, each crafted and trained by our team to achieve state-of-the-art editing results. We also propose a filtering pipeline to eliminate poorly edited video pairs. Furthermore, we explore common video editing architectures to identify the most effective structure based on current pre-trained generative model. Extensive experiments show that our dataset can help to yield remarkably high-quality video editing results. More details are available at https://senorita-2m-dataset.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neighboring Autoregressive Modeling for Efficient Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10696v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual autoregressive models typically adhere to a raster-order ``next-token prediction" paradigm, which overlooks the spatial and temporal locality inherent in visual content. Specifically, visual tokens exhibit significantly stronger correlations with their spatially or temporally adjacent tokens compared to those that are distant. In this paper, we propose Neighboring Autoregressive Modeling (NAR), a novel paradigm that formulates autoregressive visual generation as a progressive outpainting procedure, following a near-to-far ``next-neighbor prediction" mechanism. Starting from an initial token, the remaining tokens are decoded in ascending order of their Manhattan distance from the initial token in the spatial-temporal space, progressively expanding the boundary of the decoded region. To enable parallel prediction of multiple adjacent tokens in the spatial-temporal space, we introduce a set of dimension-oriented decoding heads, each predicting the next token along a mutually orthogonal dimension. During inference, all tokens adjacent to the decoded tokens are processed in parallel, substantially reducing the model forward steps for generation. Experiments on ImageNet$256\times 256$ and UCF101 demonstrate that NAR achieves 2.4$\times$ and 8.6$\times$ higher throughput respectively, while obtaining superior FID/FVD scores for both image and video generation tasks compared to the PAR-4X approach. When evaluating on text-to-image generation benchmark GenEval, NAR with 0.8B parameters outperforms Chameleon-7B while using merely 0.4 of the training data.

By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{COVER} (\textbf{\underline{CO}}unterfactual \textbf{\underline{V}}id\textbf{\underline{E}}o \textbf{\underline{R}}easoning), a multidimensional multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across the abstract-concrete and perception-cognition dimensions. Beyond prior multimodal benchmarks, COVER decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions, enabling fine-grained reasoning analysis. Experiments on commercial and open-source models reveal a strong correlation between sub-question accuracy and counterfactual reasoning performance, highlighting the role of structured inference in video understanding. Furthermore, our results suggest a key insight: enhancing the reasoning capability of models is essential for improving the robustness of video understanding.

Unlike existing approaches that rely on priors from multi-view image and video generation models, our method is based on native 3D mesh generation models. Naively applying 3D mesh generation models to generate a mesh for each frame in a 4D task can lead to issues such as incorrect mesh poses, misalignment of mesh appearance, and inconsistencies in mesh geometry and texture maps. To address these problems, we propose a structured workflow that includes camera search and mesh reposing, condition embedding optimization for mesh appearance refinement, pairwise mesh registration for topology consistency, and global texture map optimization for texture consistency. Our method outputs high-quality 4D animated assets that are compatible with mainstream graphics and game software. Experimental results across a variety of animation types and motion amplitudes demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method.

| **[REGEN: Learning Compact Video Embedding with (Re-)Generative Decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08665v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel perspective on learning video embedders for generative modeling: rather than requiring an exact reproduction of an input video, an effective embedder should focus on synthesizing visually plausible reconstructions. This relaxed criterion enables substantial improvements in compression ratios without compromising the quality of downstream generative models. Specifically, we propose replacing the conventional encoder-decoder video embedder with an encoder-generator framework that employs a diffusion transformer (DiT) to synthesize missing details from a compact latent space. Therein, we develop a dedicated latent conditioning module to condition the DiT decoder on the encoded video latent embedding. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach enables superior encoding-decoding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the compression ratio increases. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we report results from our video embedders achieving a temporal compression ratio of up to 32x (8x higher than leading video embedders) and validate the robustness of this ultra-compact latent space for text-to-video generation, providing a significant efficiency boost in latent diffusion model training and inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning-Free Multi-Event Long Video Generation via Synchronized Coupled Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08605v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in text-to-video diffusion models enable high-quality short video generation from a single prompt, generating real-world long videos in a single pass remains challenging due to limited data and high computational costs. To address this, several works propose tuning-free approaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation, specifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content changes. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions between adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of semantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose Synchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that synchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range consistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two complementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling, which ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence, respectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns denoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended content changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS synchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise, ensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive experiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video generation, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence, outperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page with visuals: https://syncos2025.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://sites.google.com/view/vta-ldm</p></details> |

However, the leading video generation models remain closed-source, resulting in a notable performance gap between industry capabilities and those available to the public. In this report, we introduce HunyuanVideo, an innovative open-source video foundation model that demonstrates performance in video generation comparable to, or even surpassing, that of leading closed-source models. HunyuanVideo encompasses a comprehensive framework that integrates several key elements, including data curation, advanced architectural design, progressive model scaling and training, and an efficient infrastructure tailored for large-scale model training and inference. As a result, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13 billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. We conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to ensure high visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced filming techniques. According to evaluations by professionals, HunyuanVideo outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6, and three top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code for the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source communities.

However, current T2V models struggle to grasp abstract physical principles and generate videos that adhere to physical laws. This challenge arises primarily from a lack of clear guidance on physical information due to a significant gap between abstract physical principles and generation models. To this end, we introduce the World Simulator Assistant (WISA), an effective framework for decomposing and incorporating physical principles into T2V models. Specifically, WISA decomposes physical principles into textual physical descriptions, qualitative physical categories, and quantitative physical properties. To effectively embed these physical attributes into the generation process, WISA incorporates several key designs, including Mixture-of-Physical-Experts Attention (MoPA) and a Physical Classifier, enhancing the model's physics awareness. Furthermore, most existing datasets feature videos where physical phenomena are either weakly represented or entangled with multiple co-occurring processes, limiting their suitability as dedicated resources for learning explicit physical principles. We propose a novel video dataset, WISA-32K, collected based on qualitative physical categories. It consists of 32,000 videos, representing 17 physical laws across three domains of physics: dynamics, thermodynamics, and optics. Experimental results demonstrate that WISA can effectively enhance the compatibility of T2V models with real-world physical laws, achieving a considerable improvement on the VideoPhy benchmark. The visual exhibitions of WISA and WISA-32K are available in the https://360cvgroup.github.io/WISA/.</p></details> |  |

Further pursuing the unification of generation and editing tasks has yielded significant progress in the domain of image content creation. However, due to the intrinsic demands for consistency across both temporal and spatial dynamics, achieving a unified approach for video synthesis remains challenging. We introduce VACE, which enables users to perform Video tasks within an All-in-one framework for Creation and Editing. These tasks include reference-to-video generation, video-to-video editing, and masked video-to-video editing. Specifically, we effectively integrate the requirements of various tasks by organizing video task inputs, such as editing, reference, and masking, into a unified interface referred to as the Video Condition Unit (VCU). Furthermore, by utilizing a Context Adapter structure, we inject different task concepts into the model using formalized representations of temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing it to handle arbitrary video synthesis tasks flexibly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the unified model of VACE achieves performance on par with task-specific models across various subtasks. Simultaneously, it enables diverse applications through versatile task combinations.

We treat the dense prediction task of matting as video generation, leveraging the text-to-video alignment prior of video diffusion models to generate alpha mattes that are temporally coherent and closely related to the corresponding semantic instances. Moreover, we propose a new Latent-Constructive loss to further distinguish different instances, enabling more controllable interactive matting. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale video referring matting dataset with 10,000 videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that concurrently contains captions, videos, and instance-level alpha mattes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Hansxsourse/VRMDiff.</p></details> |  |

We present four key contributions to address the challenges of spatiotemporal video processing. First, we introduce the 3D Mobile Inverted Vector-Quantization Variational Autoencoder (3D-MBQ-VAE), which combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with masked token modeling to enhance spatiotemporal video compression. The model achieves superior temporal consistency and state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality by employing a novel training strategy with full frame masking. Second, we present MotionAura, a text-to-video generation framework that utilizes vector-quantized diffusion models to discretize the latent space and capture complex motion dynamics, producing temporally coherent videos aligned with text prompts. Third, we propose a spectral transformer-based denoising network that processes video data in the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform. This method effectively captures global context and long-range dependencies for high-quality video generation and denoising. Lastly, we introduce a downstream task of Sketch Guided Video Inpainting. This task leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our models achieve SOTA performance on a range of benchmarks. Our work offers robust frameworks for spatiotemporal modeling and user-driven video content manipulation.

This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of T2V-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-to-video outputs remain challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed T2VEval-Bench, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset for text-to-video quality evaluation, which contains 148 textual prompts and 1,783 videos generated by 13 T2V models. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we scored each video on four dimensions in the subjective experiment, which are overall impression, text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Based on T2VEval-Bench, we developed T2VEval, a multi-branch fusion scheme for T2V quality evaluation. T2VEval assesses videos across three branches: text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large language model. Additionally, we implemented a divide-and-conquer training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present ObjectMover, a generative model that can perform object movement in highly challenging scenes. Our key insight is that we model this task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and fine-tune a video generation model to leverage its knowledge of consistent object generation across video frames. We show that with this approach, our model is able to adjust to complex real-world scenarios, handling extreme lighting harmonization and object effect movement. As large-scale data for object movement are unavailable, we construct a data generation pipeline using a modern game engine to synthesize high-quality data pairs. We further propose a multi-task learning strategy that enables training on real-world video data to improve the model generalization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ObjectMover achieves outstanding results and adapts well to real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://xinyu-andy.github.io/ObjMover</p></details> |

Unlike previous approaches that process flattened local visual patches via direct discretization or adaptive query tokenization, SweetTok proposes a decoupling framework, compressing visual inputs through distinct spatial and temporal queries via \textbf{D}ecoupled \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (DQAE). This design allows SweetTok to efficiently compress video token count while achieving superior fidelity by capturing essential information across spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, we design a \textbf{M}otion-enhanced \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{C}odebook (MLC) tailored for spatial and temporal compression to address the differences in semantic representation between appearance and motion information. SweetTok significantly improves video reconstruction results by \textbf{42.8\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 dataset. With a better token compression strategy, it also boosts downstream video generation results by \textbf{15.1\%} w.r.t gFVD. Additionally, the compressed decoupled tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes LightMotion, a light and tuning-free method for simulating camera motion in video generation. Operating in the latent space, it eliminates additional fine-tuning, inpainting, and depth estimation, making it more streamlined than existing methods. The endeavors of this paper comprise: (i) The latent space permutation operation effectively simulates various camera motions like panning, zooming, and rotation. (ii) The latent space resampling strategy combines background-aware sampling and cross-frame alignment to accurately fill new perspectives while maintaining coherence across frames. (iii) Our in-depth analysis shows that the permutation and resampling cause an SNR shift in latent space, leading to poor-quality generation. To address this, we propose latent space correction, which reintroduces noise during denoising to mitigate SNR shift and enhance video generation quality. Exhaustive experiments show that our LightMotion outperforms existing methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | 18 pages in total |

While existing methods can personalize subject appearances and motions, they still struggle with complex relational video customization, where precise relational modeling and high generalization across subject categories are essential. The primary challenge arises from the intricate spatial arrangements, layout variations, and nuanced temporal dynamics inherent in relations; consequently, current models tend to overemphasize irrelevant visual details rather than capturing meaningful interactions. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRelation, a novel approach that personalizes relations through a small set of exemplar videos, leveraging two key components: Relational Decoupling Learning and Relational Dynamics Enhancement. First, in Relational Decoupling Learning, we disentangle relations from subject appearances using relation LoRA triplet and hybrid mask training strategy, ensuring better generalization across diverse relationships. Furthermore, we determine the optimal design of relation LoRA triplet by analyzing the distinct roles of the query, key, and value features within MM-DiT's attention mechanism, making DreamRelation the first relational video generation framework with explainable components. Second, in Relational Dynamics Enhancement, we introduce space-time relational contrastive loss, which prioritizes relational dynamics while minimizing the reliance on detailed subject appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamRelation outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relational video customization. Code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dreamrelation.github.io</p></details> |

Effective traversal of the latent space learned by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has been the basis for recent breakthroughs in image editing. However, the applicability of such advancements to the video domain has been hindered by the difficulty of representing and controlling videos in the latent space of GANs. In particular, videos are composed of content (i.e., appearance) and complex motion components that require a special mechanism to disentangle and control. To achieve this, VidStyleODE encodes the video content in a pre-trained StyleGAN $\mathcal{W}_+$ space and benefits from a latent ODE component to summarize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the input video. Our novel continuous video generation process then combines the two to generate high-quality and temporally consistent videos with varying frame rates.

Existing methods primarily use asynchronous auto-regressive models or synchronous diffusion models to address this challenge. However, asynchronous auto-regressive models often suffer from inconsistencies between training and inference, leading to issues such as error accumulation, while synchronous diffusion models are limited by their reliance on rigid sequence length. To address these issues, we introduce Auto-Regressive Diffusion (AR-Diffusion), a novel model that combines the strengths of auto-regressive and diffusion models for flexible, asynchronous video generation. Specifically, our approach leverages diffusion to gradually corrupt video frames in both training and inference, reducing the discrepancy between these phases. Inspired by auto-regressive generation, we incorporate a non-decreasing constraint on the corruption timesteps of individual frames, ensuring that earlier frames remain clearer than subsequent ones. This setup, together with temporal causal attention, enables flexible generation of videos with varying lengths while preserving temporal coherence. In addition, we design two specialized timestep schedulers: the FoPP scheduler for balanced timestep sampling during training, and the AD scheduler for flexible timestep differences during inference, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves competitive and state-of-the-art results across four challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) planning. MovieAgent offers two key advantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated movie/long-video generation. Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent can generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent narrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and stable audio throughout the film. 2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical CoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings, and cinematography, significantly reducing human effort. By employing multiple LLM agents to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter, storyboard artist, and location manager, MovieAgent streamlines the production pipeline.

In this paper, we explore the task of learning to animate images to portray delicate human actions using a small number of videos -- 16 or fewer -- which is highly valuable for real-world applications like video and movie production. Learning generalizable motion patterns that smoothly transition from user-provided reference images in a few-shot setting is highly challenging. We propose FLASH (Few-shot Learning to Animate and Steer Humans), which learns generalizable motion patterns by forcing the model to reconstruct a video using the motion features and cross-frame correspondences of another video with the same motion but different appearance. This encourages transferable motion learning and mitigates overfitting to limited training data. Additionally, FLASH extends the decoder with additional layers to propagate details from the reference image to generated frames, improving transition smoothness. Human judges overwhelmingly favor FLASH, with 65.78\% of 488 responses prefer FLASH over baselines.

| **[Motion Dreamer: Boundary Conditional Motion Reasoning for Physically Coherent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00547v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation have shown promise for generating future scenarios, critical for planning and control in autonomous driving and embodied intelligence. However, real-world applications demand more than visually plausible predictions; they require reasoning about object motions based on explicitly defined boundary conditions, such as initial scene image and partial object motion. We term this capability Boundary Conditional Motion Reasoning. Current approaches either neglect explicit user-defined motion constraints, producing physically inconsistent motions, or conversely demand complete motion inputs, which are rarely available in practice. Here we introduce Motion Dreamer, a two-stage framework that explicitly separates motion reasoning from visual synthesis, addressing these limitations. Our approach introduces instance flow, a sparse-to-dense motion representation enabling effective integration of partial user-defined motions, and the motion inpainting strategy to robustly enable reasoning motions of other objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Motion Dreamer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior motion plausibility and visual realism, thus bridging the gap towards practical boundary conditional motion reasoning.

| **[E2ED^2:Direct Mapping from Noise to Data for Enhanced Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21044v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have established themselves as the de facto primary paradigm in visual generative modeling, revolutionizing the field through remarkable success across various diverse applications ranging from high-quality image synthesis to temporal aware video generation. Despite these advancements, three fundamental limitations persist, including 1) discrepancy between training and inference processes, 2) progressive information leakage throughout the noise corruption procedures, and 3) inherent constraints preventing effective integration of modern optimization criteria like perceptual and adversarial loss. To mitigate these critical challenges, we in this paper present a novel end-to-end learning paradigm that establishes direct optimization from the final generated samples to initial noises. Our proposed End-to-End Differentiable Diffusion, dubbed E2ED^2, introduces several key improvements: it eliminates the sequential training-sampling mismatch and intermediate information leakage via conceptualizing training as a direct transformation from isotropic Gaussian noise to the target data distribution. Additionally, such training framework enables seamless incorporation of adversarial and perceptual losses into the core optimization objective. Comprehensive evaluation across standard benchmarks including COCO30K and HW30K reveals that our method achieves substantial performance gains in terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP score, even with fewer sampling steps (less than 4). Our findings highlight that the end-to-end mechanism might pave the way for more robust and efficient solutions, \emph{i.e.,} combining diffusion stability with GAN-like discriminative optimization in an end-to-end manner.</p></details> | Technical report |

However, their adherence to physical commonsense across real-world actions remains unclear (e.g., playing tennis, backflip). Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations such as limited size, lack of human evaluation, sim-to-real gaps, and absence of fine-grained physical rule analysis. To address this, we introduce VideoPhy-2, an action-centric dataset for evaluating physical commonsense in generated videos. We curate 200 diverse actions and detailed prompts for video synthesis from modern generative models. We perform human evaluation that assesses semantic adherence, physical commonsense, and grounding of physical rules in the generated videos. Our findings reveal major shortcomings, with even the best model achieving only 22% joint performance (i.e., high semantic and physical commonsense adherence) on the hard subset of VideoPhy-2. We find that the models particularly struggle with conservation laws like mass and momentum. Finally, we also train VideoPhy-AutoEval, an automatic evaluator for fast, reliable assessment on our dataset. Overall, VideoPhy-2 serves as a rigorous benchmark, exposing critical gaps in video generative models and guiding future research in physically-grounded video generation.

However, they are still hard to meet requirements of applications due to unsatisfied generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose to align video foundation models with human preferences from the perspective of post-training in this paper. Consequently, we introduce an Iterative Preference Optimization strategy to enhance generated video quality by incorporating human feedback. Specifically, IPO exploits a critic model to justify video generations for pairwise ranking as in Direct Preference Optimization or point-wise scoring as in Kahneman-Tversky Optimization. Given this, IPO optimizes video foundation models with guidance of signals from preference feedback, which helps improve generated video quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. In addition, IPO incorporates the critic model with the multi-modality large language model, which enables it to automatically assign preference labels without need of retraining or relabeling. In this way, IPO can efficiently perform multi-round preference optimization in an iterative manner, without the need of tediously manual labeling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IPO can effectively improve the video generation quality of a pretrained model and help a model with only 2B parameters surpass the one with 5B parameters. Besides, IPO achieves new state-of-the-art performance on VBench benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[TR-DQ: Time-Rotation Diffusion Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06564v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been widely adopted in image and video generation. However, their complex network architecture leads to high inference overhead for its generation process. Existing diffusion quantization methods primarily focus on the quantization of the model structure while ignoring the impact of time-steps variation during sampling. At the same time, most current approaches fail to account for significant activations that cannot be eliminated, resulting in substantial performance degradation after quantization. To address these issues, we propose Time-Rotation Diffusion Quantization (TR-DQ), a novel quantization method incorporating time-step and rotation-based optimization. TR-DQ first divides the sampling process based on time-steps and applies a rotation matrix to smooth activations and weights dynamically. For different time-steps, a dedicated hyperparameter is introduced for adaptive timing modeling, which enables dynamic quantization across different time steps. Additionally, we also explore the compression potential of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG-wise) to establish a foundation for subsequent work. TR-DQ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on image generation and video generation tasks and a 1.38-1.89x speedup and 1.97-2.58x memory reduction in inference compared to existing quantization methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the enhanced capabilities of DiTs come with significant drawbacks, including increased computational and memory costs, which hinder their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Current acceleration techniques, such as quantization and cache mechanism, offer limited speedup and are often applied in isolation, failing to fully address the complexities of DiT architectures. In this paper, we propose QuantCache, a novel training-free inference acceleration framework that jointly optimizes hierarchical latent caching, adaptive importance-guided quantization, and structural redundancy-aware pruning. QuantCache achieves an end-to-end latency speedup of 6.72$\times$ on Open-Sora with minimal loss in generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, setting a new standard for efficient DiT inference.

| **[Generative Video Bi-flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06364v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel generative video model by robustly learning temporal change as a neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) flow with a bilinear objective of combining two aspects: The first is to map from the past into future video frames directly. Previous work has mapped the noise to new frames, a more computationally expensive process. Unfortunately, starting from the previous frame, instead of noise, is more prone to drifting errors. Hence, second, we additionally learn how to remove the accumulated errors as the joint objective by adding noise during training. We demonstrate unconditional video generation in a streaming manner for various video datasets, all at competitive quality compared to a baseline conditional diffusion but with higher speed, i.e., fewer ODE solver steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text2Story: Advancing Video Storytelling with Text Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06310v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating coherent long-form video sequences from discrete input using only text prompts is a critical task in content creation. While diffusion-based models excel at short video synthesis, long-form storytelling from text remains largely unexplored and a challenge due to challenges pertaining to temporal coherency, preserving semantic meaning and action continuity across the video. We introduce a novel storytelling approach to enable seamless video generation with natural action transitions and structured narratives. We present a bidirectional time-weighted latent blending strategy to ensure temporal consistency between segments of the long-form video being generated. Further, our method extends the Black-Scholes algorithm from prompt mixing for image generation to video generation, enabling controlled motion evolution through structured text conditioning. To further enhance motion continuity, we propose a semantic action representation framework to encode high-level action semantics into the blending process, dynamically adjusting transitions based on action similarity, ensuring smooth yet adaptable motion changes. Latent space blending maintains spatial coherence between objects in a scene, while time-weighted blending enforces bidirectional constraints for temporal consistency. This integrative approach prevents abrupt transitions while ensuring fluid storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, achieving temporally consistent and visually compelling video narratives without any additional training. Our approach bridges the gap between short clips and extended video to establish a new paradigm in GenAI-driven video synthesis from text.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Rethinking Video Tokenization: A Conditioned Diffusion-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03708v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video tokenizers typically use the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture for video compression and reconstruction. However, to achieve good performance, its training process often relies on complex multi-stage training tricks that go beyond basic reconstruction loss and KL regularization. Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise tuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate higher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel Conditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based decoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses spatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder reconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these latents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate videos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt sampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a basic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS perceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a single-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\times$ inference speedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent video generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The source code and pretrained weights will be released shortly, so please stay tuned for updates!</p></details> |  |
| **[The Best of Both Worlds: Integrating Language Models and Diffusion Models for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04606v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have been driven by two competing paradigms: autoregressive language models and diffusion models. However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a $\sim$14,000$\times$ compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Kling, and Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field.

| **[Self-Guidance: Boosting Flow and Diffusion Generation on Their Own](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05827v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proper guidance strategies are essential to achieve high-quality generation results without retraining diffusion and flow-based text-to-image models. Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, potentially limiting their applications. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which improves the image quality by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. SG only relies on the sampling probabilities of its own diffusion model at different noise levels with no need of any guidance-specific training. This makes it flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms, maximizing its potential to achieve competitive performances in many generative tasks. We conduct experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, Self-Guidance surpasses existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. Moreover, we find that SG has a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing its ability of eliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We will release our code along with this paper.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[VACT: A Video Automatic Causal Testing System and a Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06163v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of text-conditioned Video Generation Models (VGMs), the quality of generated videos has significantly improved, bringing these models closer to functioning as ``*world simulators*'' and making real-world-level video generation more accessible and cost-effective. However, the generated videos often contain factual inaccuracies and lack understanding of fundamental physical laws. While some previous studies have highlighted this issue in limited domains through manual analysis, a comprehensive solution has not yet been established, primarily due to the absence of a generalized, automated approach for modeling and assessing the causal reasoning of these models across diverse scenarios. To address this gap, we propose VACT: an **automated** framework for modeling, evaluating, and measuring the causal understanding of VGMs in real-world scenarios. By combining causal analysis techniques with a carefully designed large language model assistant, our system can assess the causal behavior of models in various contexts without human annotation, which offers strong generalization and scalability. Additionally, we introduce multi-level causal evaluation metrics to provide a detailed analysis of the causal performance of VGMs. As a demonstration, we use our framework to benchmark several prevailing VGMs, offering insight into their causal reasoning capabilities. Our work lays the foundation for systematically addressing the causal understanding deficiencies in VGMs and contributes to advancing their reliability and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods have limitations: 3D diffusion models are limited by dataset scarcity and the absence of strong pre-trained priors, while 2D diffusion-based approaches struggle with geometric consistency. We propose a method that leverages 2D diffusion models' implicit 3D reasoning ability while ensuring 3D consistency via Gaussian-splatting-based geometric distillation. Specifically, the proposed Gaussian Splatting Decoder enforces 3D consistency by transforming SV3D latent outputs into an explicit 3D representation. Unlike SV3D, which only relies on implicit 2D representations for video generation, Gaussian Splatting explicitly encodes spatial and appearance attributes, enabling multi-view consistency through geometric constraints. These constraints correct view inconsistencies, ensuring robust geometric consistency. As a result, our approach simultaneously generates high-quality, multi-view-consistent images and accurate 3D models, providing a scalable solution for single-image-based 3D generation and bridging the gap between 2D Diffusion diversity and 3D structural coherence. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art multi-view consistency and strong generalization across diverse datasets. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

To achieve greater control over generated results, researchers introduce additional architectures, such as ControlNet, Adapters and ReferenceNet, to integrate conditioning controls. However, current controllable generation methods often require substantial additional computational resources, especially for video generation, and face challenges in training or exhibit weak control. In this paper, we propose ControlNeXt: a powerful and efficient method for controllable image and video generation. We first design a more straightforward and efficient architecture, replacing heavy additional branches with minimal additional cost compared to the base model. Such a concise structure also allows our method to seamlessly integrate with other LoRA weights, enabling style alteration without the need for additional training. As for training, we reduce up to 90% of learnable parameters compared to the alternatives. Furthermore, we propose another method called Cross Normalization (CN) as a replacement for Zero-Convolution' to achieve fast and stable training convergence. We have conducted various experiments with different base models across images and videos, demonstrating the robustness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>contr...</summary><p>controllable generation</p></details> |

Recent generative approaches, boosted by large-scale pre-trained video generation models, show promise in handling intricate scenes. However, they frequently produce unstable motion and content inconsistencies due to the absence of explicit motion trajectory constraints. To address these challenges, we propose Motion-aware Generative frame interpolation (MoG) that synergizes intermediate flow guidance with generative capacities to enhance interpolation fidelity. Our key insight is to simultaneously enforce motion smoothness through flow constraints while adaptively correcting flow estimation errors through generative refinement. Specifically, we first introduce a dual guidance injection that propagates condition information using intermediate flow at both latent and feature levels, aligning the generated motion with flow-derived motion trajectories. Meanwhile, we implemented two critical designs, encoder-only guidance injection and selective parameter fine-tuning, which enable dynamic artifact correction in the complex motion regions. Extensive experiments on both real-world and animation benchmarks demonstrate that MoG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of video quality and visual fidelity. Our work bridges the gap between flow-based stability and generative flexibility, offering a versatile solution for frame interpolation across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06053v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation.

Generating such sequences with precise temporal control is infeasible with existing video generators that rely on a single paragraph of text as input. When tasked with generating multiple events described using a single prompt, such methods often ignore some of the events or fail to arrange them in the correct order. To address this limitation, we present MinT, a multi-event video generator with temporal control. Our key insight is to bind each event to a specific period in the generated video, which allows the model to focus on one event at a time. To enable time-aware interactions between event captions and video tokens, we design a time-based positional encoding method, dubbed ReRoPE. This encoding helps to guide the cross-attention operation. By fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion transformer on temporally grounded data, our approach produces coherent videos with smoothly connected events. For the first time in the literature, our model offers control over the timing of events in generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MinT outperforms existing commercial and open-source models by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

It supports varied facial poses, including back-facing views, and animates single or multiple characters with input masks for precise speaker designation in multi-character scenes. Our approach tackles key challenges with three innovations: (1) 3D full-attention mechanisms with a sliding window denoising strategy, enabling infinite video generation with temporal coherence and visual quality across diverse character styles; (2) a two-stage curriculum learning scheme, integrating audio for lip sync, text for expressive dynamics, and reference images for identity preservation, enabling flexible multi-modal control over long sequences; and (3) region-specific masks with adaptive loss functions to balance global textual control and local audio guidance, supporting speaker-specific animations.

Understanding this dual role enabled us to control query feature injection (Q injection) and demonstrate two applications: (1) a zero-shot motion transfer method that is 20 times more efficient than existing approaches, and (2) a training-free technique for consistent multi-shot video generation, where characters maintain identity across multiple video shots while Q injection enhances motion fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>(1) P...</summary><p>(1) Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/MotionByQueries/ (2) The methods and results in section 5, "Consistent multi-shot video generation", are based on the arXiv version 1 (v1) of this work.

Various benchmarks are introduced for better evaluating the MLLMs. Nevertheless, current video benchmarks are still inefficient for evaluating video models during iterative development due to the high cost of constructing datasets and the difficulty in isolating specific skills. In this paper, we propose VideoNIAH (Video Needle In A Haystack), a benchmark construction framework through synthetic video generation. VideoNIAH decouples video content from their query-responses by inserting unrelated visual 'needles' into original videos. The framework automates the generation of query-response pairs using predefined rules, minimizing manual labor. The queries focus on specific aspects of video understanding, enabling more skill-specific evaluations. The separation between video content and the queries also allow for increased video variety and evaluations across different lengths. Utilizing VideoNIAH, we compile a video benchmark VNBench, which includes tasks such as retrieval, ordering, and counting to evaluate three key aspects of video understanding: temporal perception, chronological ordering, and spatio-temporal coherence. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both proprietary and open-source models, uncovering significant differences in their video understanding capabilities across various tasks. Additionally, we perform an in-depth analysis of the test results and model configurations. Based on these findings, we provide some advice for improving video MLLM training, offering valuable insights to guide future research and model development.

To alleviate these issues, we propose DreamForge, an advanced diffusion-based autoregressive video generation model tailored for 3D-controllable long-term generation. To enhance the lane and foreground generation, we introduce perspective guidance and integrate object-wise position encoding to incorporate local 3D correlation and improve foreground object modeling. We also propose motion-aware temporal attention to capture motion cues and appearance changes in videos. By leveraging motion frames and an autoregressive generation paradigm,we can autoregressively generate long videos (over 200 frames) using a model trained in short sequences, achieving superior quality compared to the baseline in 16-frame video evaluations.

However, challenges remain in improving story attractiveness, enriching storytelling expressiveness, and developing open-source evaluation benchmarks and frameworks. Therefore, we propose and opensource MM-StoryAgent, which creates immersive narrated video storybooks with refined plots, role-consistent images, and multi-channel audio. MM-StoryAgent designs a multi-agent framework that employs LLMs and diverse expert tools (generative models and APIs) across several modalities to produce expressive storytelling videos. The framework enhances story attractiveness through a multi-stage writing pipeline. In addition, it improves the immersive storytelling experience by integrating sound effects with visual, music and narrative assets. MM-StoryAgent offers a flexible, open-source platform for further development, where generative modules can be substituted.

A key approach is training reward models to guide preference optimization. However, existing models are often task-specific, limiting their adaptability across diverse visual applications. We also argue that jointly learning to assess multiple tasks may foster a synergistic effect, where improved image understanding enhances image generation assessment, and refined image evaluation benefits video assessment through better frame analysis. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward, the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation assessment, enabling both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, which can be employed for vision model preference alignment. Specifically, (1) we first develop UnifiedReward on our constructed large-scale human preference dataset, including both image and video generation/understanding tasks.

| **[Raccoon: Multi-stage Diffusion Training with Coarse-to-Fine Curating Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21314v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generation has demonstrated promising progress with the advent of diffusion models, yet existing approaches are limited by dataset quality and computational resources. To address these limitations, this paper presents a comprehensive approach that advances both data curation and model design. We introduce CFC-VIDS-1M, a high-quality video dataset constructed through a systematic coarse-to-fine curation pipeline. The pipeline first evaluates video quality across multiple dimensions, followed by a fine-grained stage that leverages vision-language models to enhance text-video alignment and semantic richness. Building upon the curated dataset's emphasis on visual quality and temporal coherence, we develop RACCOON, a transformer-based architecture with decoupled spatial-temporal attention mechanisms. The model is trained through a progressive four-stage strategy designed to efficiently handle the complexities of video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our integrated approach of high-quality data curation and efficient training strategy generates visually appealing and temporally coherent videos while maintaining computational efficiency. We will release our dataset, code, and models.</p></details> |  |

A Closer Look at Controllable Human Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04666v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality benchmarks are crucial for driving progress in machine learning research. However, despite the growing interest in video generation, there is no comprehensive dataset to evaluate human generation. Humans can perform a wide variety of actions and interactions, but existing datasets, like TikTok and TED-Talks, lack the diversity and complexity to fully capture the capabilities of video generation models. We close this gap by introducing `What Are You Doing?' (WYD): a new benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of controllable image-to-video generation of humans. WYD consists of 1{,}544 captioned videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 56 fine-grained categories. These allow us to systematically measure performance across 9 aspects of human generation, including actions, interactions and motion. We also propose and validate automatic metrics that leverage our annotations and better capture human evaluations. Equipped with our dataset and metrics, we perform in-depth analyses of seven state-of-the-art models in controllable image-to-video generation, showing how WYD provides novel insights about the capabilities of these models. We release our data and code to drive forward progress in human video generation modeling at https://github.com/google-deepmind/wyd-benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Traditional latent diffusion pipelines rely on large Variational Autoencoder decoders that can slow down generation and consume considerable GPU memory. We propose custom-trained decoders using lightweight Vision Transformer and Taming Transformer architectures. Experiments show up to 15% overall speed-ups for image generation on COCO2017 and up to 20 times faster decoding in the sub-module, with additional gains on UCF-101 for video tasks. Memory requirements are moderately reduced, and while there is a small drop in perceptual quality compared to the default decoder, the improvements in speed and scalability are crucial for large-scale inference scenarios such as generating 100K images. Our work is further contextualized by advances in efficient video generation, including dual masking strategies, illustrating a broader effort to improve the scalability and efficiency of generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, generating long-duration, surround-view consistent driving videos remains a significant challenge. To address this, we present UniMLVG, a unified framework designed to generate extended street multi-perspective videos under precise control. By integrating single- and multi-view driving videos into the training data, our approach updates a DiT-based diffusion model equipped with cross-frame and cross-view modules across three stages with multi training objectives, substantially boosting the diversity and quality of generated visual content. Importantly, we propose an innovative explicit viewpoint modeling approach for multi-view video generation to effectively improve motion transition consistency. Capable of handling various input reference formats (e.g., text, images, or video), our UniMLVG generates high-quality multi-view videos according to the corresponding condition constraints such as 3D bounding boxes or frame-level text descriptions. Compared to the best models with similar capabilities, our framework achieves improvements of 48.2% in FID and 35.2% in FVD.</p></details> |  |

Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video. Results are best viewed in videos. Check out our webpage! https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/GEN3C/</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2025.

The synthesized videos are evaluated on mainly two aspects, lip-speech synchronization and image fidelity. Recent studies demonstrate that GAN-based and diffusion-based models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on this task, with diffusion-based models achieving superior image fidelity but experiencing lower synchronization compared to their GAN-based counterparts. To this end, we propose SyncDiff, a simple yet effective approach to improve diffusion-based models using a temporal pose frame with information bottleneck and facial-informative audio features extracted from AVHuBERT, as conditioning input into the diffusion process. We evaluate SyncDiff on two canonical talking head datasets, LRS2 and LRS3 for direct comparison with other SOTA models. Experiments on LRS2/LRS3 datasets show that SyncDiff achieves a synchronization score 27.7%/62.3% relatively higher than previous diffusion-based methods, while preserving their high-fidelity characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Tuning Discrete Diffusion Models via Reward Optimization with Applications to DNA and Protein Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13643v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the strong empirical performance of diffusion models on discrete sequences across domains from natural language to biological sequence generation. For example, in the protein inverse folding task, conditional diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating natural-like sequences that fold back into the original structure. However, practical design tasks often require not only modeling a conditional distribution but also optimizing specific task objectives. For instance, we may prefer protein sequences with high stability. To address this, we consider the scenario where we have pre-trained discrete diffusion models that can generate natural-like sequences, as well as reward models that map sequences to task objectives. We then formulate the reward maximization problem within discrete diffusion models, analogous to reinforcement learning (RL), while minimizing the KL divergence against pretrained diffusion models to preserve naturalness. To solve this RL problem, we propose a novel algorithm, DRAKES, that enables direct backpropagation of rewards through entire trajectories generated by diffusion models, by making the originally non-differentiable trajectories differentiable using the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our theoretical analysis indicates that our approach can generate sequences that are both natural-like and yield high rewards. While similar tasks have been recently explored in diffusion models for continuous domains, our work addresses unique algorithmic and theoretical challenges specific to discrete diffusion models, which arise from their foundation in continuous-time Markov chains rather than Brownian motion. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRAKES in generating DNA and protein sequences that optimize enhancer activity and protein stability, respectively, important tasks for gene therapies and protein-based therapeutics.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[One-Step Residual Shifting Diffusion for Image Super-Resolution via Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13358v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models for super-resolution (SR) produce high-quality visual results but require expensive computational costs. Despite the development of several methods to accelerate diffusion-based SR models, some (e.g., SinSR) fail to produce realistic perceptual details, while others (e.g., OSEDiff) may hallucinate non-existent structures. To overcome these issues, we present RSD, a new distillation method for ResShift, one of the top diffusion-based SR models. Our method is based on training the student network to produce such images that a new fake ResShift model trained on them will coincide with the teacher model. RSD achieves single-step restoration and outperforms the teacher by a large margin. We show that our distillation method can surpass the other distillation-based method for ResShift - SinSR - making it on par with state-of-the-art diffusion-based SR distillation methods. Compared to SR methods based on pre-trained text-to-image models, RSD produces competitive perceptual quality, provides images with better alignment to degraded input images, and requires fewer parameters and GPU memory. We provide experimental results on various real-world and synthetic datasets, including RealSR, RealSet65, DRealSR, ImageNet, and DIV2K.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Gaussian Splatting: Generating 3D Scenes with Video Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13272v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing consistent and photorealistic 3D scenes is an open problem in computer vision. Video diffusion models generate impressive videos but cannot directly synthesize 3D representations, i.e., lack 3D consistency in the generated sequences. In addition, directly training generative 3D models is challenging due to a lack of 3D training data at scale. In this work, we present Generative Gaussian Splatting (GGS) -- a novel approach that integrates a 3D representation with a pre-trained latent video diffusion model. Specifically, our model synthesizes a feature field parameterized via 3D Gaussian primitives. The feature field is then either rendered to feature maps and decoded into multi-view images, or directly upsampled into a 3D radiance field. We evaluate our approach on two common benchmark datasets for scene synthesis, RealEstate10K and ScanNet+, and find that our proposed GGS model significantly improves both the 3D consistency of the generated multi-view images, and the quality of the generated 3D scenes over all relevant baselines. Compared to a similar model without 3D representation, GGS improves FID on the generated 3D scenes by ~20% on both RealEstate10K and ScanNet+.

Previous systems have primarily focused on the weak correlation between audio and gestures, leading to physically unnatural outcomes that degrade the user experience. To address this problem, we introduce HoleGest, a novel neural network framework based on decoupled diffusion and motion priors for the automatic generation of high-quality, expressive co-speech gestures. Our system leverages large-scale human motion datasets to learn a robust prior with low audio dependency and high motion reliance, enabling stable global motion and detailed finger movements. To improve the generation efficiency of diffusion-based models, we integrate implicit joint constraints with explicit geometric and conditional constraints, capturing complex motion distributions between large strides. This integration significantly enhances generation speed while maintaining high-quality motion. Furthermore, we design a shared embedding space for gesture-transcription text alignment, enabling the generation of semantically correct gesture actions. Extensive experiments and user feedback demonstrate the effectiveness and potential applications of our model, with our method achieving a level of realism close to the ground truth, providing an immersive user experience. Our code, model, and demo are are available at https://cyk990422.github.io/HoloGest.github.io/.</p></details> | Accepted by 3DV 2025 |

However, their applications are constrained by the limited availability of data and the reluctance of medical centers to share it due to patient privacy concerns. Generative models present a promising solution by creating synthetic data as a substitute for real patient data. However, medical images are typically high-dimensional, and current state-of-the-art methods are often impractical for computational resource-constrained healthcare environments. These models rely on data sub-sampling, raising doubts about their feasibility and real-world applicability. Furthermore, many of these models are evaluated on quantitative metrics that alone can be misleading in assessing the image quality and clinical meaningfulness of the generated images. To address this, we introduce MedLoRD, a generative diffusion model designed for computational resource-constrained environments. MedLoRD is capable of generating high-dimensional medical volumes with resolutions up to 512$\times$512$\times$256, utilizing GPUs with only 24GB VRAM, which are commonly found in standard desktop workstations. MedLoRD is evaluated across multiple modalities, including Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography and Lung Computed Tomography datasets. Extensive evaluations through radiological evaluation, relative regional volume analysis, adherence to conditional masks, and downstream tasks show that MedLoRD generates high-fidelity images closely adhering to segmentation mask conditions, surpassing the capabilities of current state-of-the-art generative models for medical image synthesis in computational resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence Functions for Scalable Data Attribution in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13850v4)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have led to significant advancements in generative modelling. Yet their widespread adoption poses challenges regarding data attribution and interpretability. In this paper, we aim to help address such challenges in diffusion models by developing an influence functions framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dita: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15959v5)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent vision-language-action models trained on diverse robot datasets exhibit promising generalization capabilities with limited in-domain data, their reliance on compact action heads to predict discretized or continuous actions constrains adaptability to heterogeneous action spaces. We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning.

| **[TFDM: Time-Variant Frequency-Based Point Cloud Diffusion with Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13004v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models currently demonstrate impressive performance over various generative tasks. Recent work on image diffusion highlights the strong capabilities of Mamba (state space models) due to its efficient handling of long-range dependencies and sequential data modeling. Unfortunately, joint consideration of state space models with 3D point cloud generation remains limited. To harness the powerful capabilities of the Mamba model for 3D point cloud generation, we propose a novel diffusion framework containing dual latent Mamba block (DM-Block) and a time-variant frequency encoder (TF-Encoder). The DM-Block apply a space-filling curve to reorder points into sequences suitable for Mamba state-space modeling, while operating in a latent space to mitigate the computational overhead that arises from direct 3D data processing. Meanwhile, the TF-Encoder takes advantage of the ability of the diffusion model to refine fine details in later recovery stages by prioritizing key points within the U-Net architecture. This frequency-based mechanism ensures enhanced detail quality in the final stages of generation. Experimental results on the ShapeNet-v2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance (ShapeNet-v2: 0.14\% on 1-NNA-Abs50 EMD and 57.90\% on COV EMD) on certain metrics for specific categories while reducing computational parameters and inference time by up to 10$\times$ and 9$\times$, respectively.

| **[Unlock Pose Diversity: Accurate and Efficient Implicit Keypoint-based Spatiotemporal Diffusion for Audio-driven Talking Portrait](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12963v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven single-image talking portrait generation plays a crucial role in virtual reality, digital human creation, and filmmaking. Existing approaches are generally categorized into keypoint-based and image-based methods. Keypoint-based methods effectively preserve character identity but struggle to capture fine facial details due to the fixed points limitation of the 3D Morphable Model. Moreover, traditional generative networks face challenges in establishing causality between audio and keypoints on limited datasets, resulting in low pose diversity. In contrast, image-based approaches produce high-quality portraits with diverse details using the diffusion network but incur identity distortion and expensive computational costs. In this work, we propose KDTalker, the first framework to combine unsupervised implicit 3D keypoint with a spatiotemporal diffusion model. Leveraging unsupervised implicit 3D keypoints, KDTalker adapts facial information densities, allowing the diffusion process to model diverse head poses and capture fine facial details flexibly. The custom-designed spatiotemporal attention mechanism ensures accurate lip synchronization, producing temporally consistent, high-quality animations while enhancing computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that KDTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance regarding lip synchronization accuracy, head pose diversity, and execution efficiency.Our codes are available at https://github.com/chaolongy/KDTalker.</p></details> |  |
| **[HybridVLA: Collaborative Diffusion and Autoregression in a Unified Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10631v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models, enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing autoregressive VLA methods leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they disrupt the continuity of actions. Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on VLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single large language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the generation gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the diffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe, we find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these two predictions, leading to more robust control. In experiments, HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods across various simulation and real-world tasks, including both single-arm and dual-arm robots, while demonstrating stable manipulation in previously unseen configurations.</p></details> |  |

Current methods fall short in reliably identifying unauthorized image use, as they struggle to generalize across varied generation tasks and fail when the training dataset includes images from multiple sources with few identifiable (watermarked or poisoned) samples. In this paper, we present novel evidence that diffusion-generated images faithfully preserve the statistical properties of their training data, particularly reflected in their spectral features. Leveraging this insight, we introduce \emph{CoprGuard}, a robust frequency domain watermarking framework to safeguard against unauthorized image usage in diffusion model training and fine-tuning. CoprGuard demonstrates remarkable effectiveness against a wide range of models, from naive diffusion models to sophisticated text-to-image models, and is robust even when watermarked images comprise a mere 1\% of the training dataset.

To enable more flexible image manipulation and editing, recent research has expanded from single image generation to transparent layer generation and multi-layer compositions. However, existing approaches often fail to provide a thorough exploration of multi-layer structures, leading to inconsistent inter-layer interactions, such as occlusion relationships, spatial layout, and shadowing. In this paper, we introduce DreamLayer, a novel framework that enables coherent text-driven generation of multiple image layers, by explicitly modeling the relationship between transparent foreground and background layers. DreamLayer incorporates three key components, i.e., Context-Aware Cross-Attention (CACA) for global-local information exchange, Layer-Shared Self-Attention (LSSA) for establishing robust inter-layer connections, and Information Retained Harmonization (IRH) for refining fusion details at the latent level. By leveraging a coherent full-image context, DreamLayer builds inter-layer connections through attention mechanisms and applies a harmonization step to achieve seamless layer fusion. To facilitate research in multi-layer generation, we construct a high-quality, diverse multi-layer dataset including 400k samples. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that DreamLayer generates more coherent and well-aligned layers, with broad applicability, including latent-space image editing and image-to-layer decomposition.</p></details> | Under submission |

To address these challenges, we propose a single-view RGB-D-based depth completion framework, TransDiff, that leverages the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models(DDPM) to achieve material-agnostic object grasping in desktop. Specifically, we leverage features extracted from RGB images, including semantic segmentation, edge maps, and normal maps, to condition the depth map generation process. Our method learns an iterative denoising process that transforms a random depth distribution into a depth map, guided by initially refined depth information, ensuring more accurate depth estimation in scenarios involving transparent objects. Additionally, we propose a novel training method to better align the noisy depth and RGB image features, which are used as conditions to refine depth estimation step by step. Finally, we utilized an improved inference process to accelerate the denoising procedure. Through comprehensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks with acceptable inference time.

Two fundamental limitations hinder current approaches: (1) the lack of a comprehensive suction grasp dataset tailored for parcel manipulation tasks, and (2) insufficient adaptability to diverse object characteristics including size variations, geometric complexity, and textural diversity. To address these challenges, we present Parcel-Suction-Dataset, a large-scale synthetic dataset containing 25 thousand cluttered scenes with 410 million precision-annotated suction grasp poses. This dataset is generated through our novel geometric sampling algorithm that enables efficient generation of optimal suction grasps incorporating both physical constraints and material properties. We further propose Diffusion-Suction, an innovative framework that reformulates suction grasp prediction as a conditional generation task through denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our method iteratively refines random noise into suction grasp score maps through visual-conditioned guidance from point cloud observations, effectively learning spatial point-wise affordances from our synthetic dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the simple yet efficient Diffusion-Suction achieves new state-of-the-art performance compared to previous models on both Parcel-Suction-Dataset and the public SuctionNet-1Billion benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Angiographic images can effectively assist in the diagnosis of vascular diseases. However, contrast agents may bring extra radiation exposure which is harmful to patients with health risks. To mitigate these concerns, in this paper, we aim to automatically generate angiography from non-angiographic inputs, by leveraging and enhancing the inherent physical properties of vascular structures. Previous methods relying on 2D slice-based angiography synthesis struggle with maintaining continuity in 3D vascular structures and exhibit limited effectiveness across different imaging modalities. We propose VasTSD, a 3D vascular tree-state space diffusion model to synthesize angiography from 3D non-angiographic volumes, with a novel state space serialization approach that dynamically constructs vascular tree topologies, integrating these with a diffusion-based generative model to ensure the generation of anatomically continuous vasculature in 3D volumes. A pre-trained vision embedder is employed to construct vascular state space representations, enabling consistent modeling of vascular structures across multiple modalities. Extensive experiments on various angiographic datasets demonstrate the superiority of VasTSD over prior works, achieving enhanced continuity of blood vessels in synthesized angiographic synthesis for multiple modalities and anatomical regions.</p></details> |  |

In order to improve the performance of this model, we develop a novel decoder module: Spiking Modulate De coder (SMD), which replaces the traditional Decoder module within the Transformer architecture. Additionally, we explored the substitution of DDPM with Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) in our frame work. We conducted experiments across four robotic manipulation tasks and performed ablation studies on the modulate block.

By combining diffusion models with BC, diffusion policiy has been proposed, enabling robots to quickly learn manipulation tasks with high success rates. However, integrating diffusion policy with high-capacity Transformer presents challenges, traditional Transformer architectures struggle to effectively integrate guiding conditions, resulting in poor performance in manipulation tasks when using Transformer-based models. In this paper, we investigate key architectural designs of Transformers and improve the traditional Transformer architecture by proposing the Modulated Transformer Diffusion Policy (MTDP) model for diffusion policy. The core of this model is the Modulated Attention module we proposed, which more effectively integrates the guiding conditions with the main input, improving the generative model's output quality and, consequently, increasing the robot's task success rate. In six experimental tasks, MTDP outperformed existing Transformer model architectures, particularly in the Toolhang experiment, where the success rate increased by 12\%. To verify the generality of Modulated Attention, we applied it to the UNet architecture to construct Modulated UNet Diffusion Policy model (MUDP), which also achieved higher success rates than existing UNet architectures across all six experiments. The Diffusion Policy uses Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) as the diffusion model. Building on this, we also explored Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) as the diffusion model, constructing the MTDP-I and MUDP-I model, which nearly doubled the generation speed while maintaining performance.</p></details> |  |

Typically for 2D games, illustrators begin by designing the main character image, which serves as the foundation for all subsequent animations. To create a smooth motion sequence, these subsequent animations involve drawing the character in different poses and actions, such as running, jumping, or attacking. This process requires significant manual effort from illustrators, as they must meticulously ensure consistency in design, proportions, and style across multiple motion frames. Each frame is drawn individually, making this a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Generative models, such as diffusion models, have the potential to revolutionize this process by automating the creation of sprite sheets. Diffusion models, known for their ability to generate diverse images, can be adapted to create character animations. By leveraging the capabilities of diffusion models, we can significantly reduce the manual workload for illustrators, accelerate the animation creation process, and open up new creative possibilities in game development.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://chenganhsieh.github.io/spritesheet-diffusion/</p></details> |

Building on this, various methods further fine-tune the pre-trained T2I model for specific tasks. However, this requires separate model architectures, training designs, and multiple parameter sets to handle different tasks. In this paper, we introduce UniVG, a generalist diffusion model capable of supporting a diverse range of image generation tasks with a single set of weights. UniVG treats multi-modal inputs as unified conditions to enable various downstream applications, ranging from T2I generation, inpainting, instruction-based editing, identity-preserving generation, and layout-guided generation, to depth estimation and referring segmentation. Through comprehensive empirical studies on data mixing and multi-task training, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs. For example, we show that T2I generation and other tasks, such as instruction-based editing, can coexist without performance trade-offs, while auxiliary tasks like depth estimation and referring segmentation enhance image editing. Notably, our model can even outperform some task-specific models on their respective benchmarks, marking a significant step towards a unified image generation model.</p></details> |  |

However, consistent generation of high-quality images remains challenging partly due to the lack of conditioning mechanisms for perceptual quality. In this work, we propose methods to integrate image quality assessment (IQA) models into diffusion-based generators, enabling quality-aware image generation. We show that diffusion models can learn complex qualitative relationships from both IQA models' outputs and internal activations. First, we experiment with gradient-based guidance to optimize image quality directly and show this method has limited generalizability. To address this, we introduce IQA-Adapter, a novel framework that conditions generation on target quality levels by learning the implicit relationship between images and quality scores. When conditioned on high target quality, IQA-Adapter can shift the distribution of generated images towards a higher-quality subdomain, and, inversely, it can be used as a degradation model, generating progressively more distorted images when provided with a lower-quality signal. Under high-quality condition, IQA-Adapter achieves up to a 10% improvement across multiple objective metrics, as confirmed by a user preference study, while preserving generative diversity and content. Furthermore, we extend IQA-Adapter to a reference-based conditioning scenario, utilizing the rich activation space of IQA models to transfer highly specific, content-agnostic qualitative features between images.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub repo: https://github.com/X1716/IQA-Adapter</p></details> |
| **[How compositional generalization and creativity improve as diffusion models are trained](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12089v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural data is often organized as a hierarchical composition of features. How many samples do generative models need in order to learn the composition rules, so as to produce a combinatorially large number of novel data? What signal in the data is exploited to learn those rules? We investigate these questions in the context of diffusion models both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we consider simple probabilistic context-free grammars - tree-like graphical models used to represent the hierarchical and compositional structure of data such as language and images. We demonstrate that diffusion models learn the grammar's composition rules with the sample complexity required for clustering features with statistically similar context, a process similar to the word2vec algorithm. However, this clustering emerges hierarchically: higher-level features associated with longer contexts require more data to be identified. This mechanism leads to a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the said context size. As a result, diffusion models trained on an intermediate dataset size generate data coherent up to a certain scale, but that lacks global coherence. We test these predictions in different domains, and find remarkable agreement: both generated texts and images achieve progressively larger coherence lengths as the training time or dataset size grows. We discuss connections between the hierarchical clustering mechanism we introduce here and the renormalization group in physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A3D: Does Diffusion Dream about 3D Alignment?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15020v4)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the problem of text-driven 3D generation from a geometry alignment perspective. Given a set of text prompts, we aim to generate a collection of objects with semantically corresponding parts aligned across them. Recent methods based on Score Distillation have succeeded in distilling the knowledge from 2D diffusion models to high-quality representations of the 3D objects. These methods handle multiple text queries separately, and therefore the resulting objects have a high variability in object pose and structure. However, in some applications, such as 3D asset design, it may be desirable to obtain a set of objects aligned with each other. In order to achieve the alignment of the corresponding parts of the generated objects, we propose to embed these objects into a common latent space and optimize the continuous transitions between these objects. We enforce two kinds of properties of these transitions: smoothness of the transition and plausibility of the intermediate objects along the transition. We demonstrate that both of these properties are essential for good alignment. We provide several practical scenarios that benefit from alignment between the objects, including 3D editing and object hybridization, and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. https://voyleg.github.io/a3d/</p></details> |  |

Our method utilizes multi-modal models to identify material types and initialize material parameters through image queries, while simultaneously inferring 3D Gaussian splats for detailed scene representation. We further refine these material parameters using video diffusion with a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and optical flow guidance rather than render loss or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. This integrated framework enables accurate prediction and realistic simulation of dynamic interactions in real-world scenarios, advancing both accuracy and flexibility in physics-based simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

This paper presents a cognition-decision framework that integrates individual variability and commonalities in driver behavior to quantify risk cognition and model dynamic decision-making. First, a risk sensitivity model based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution is developed to characterize individual differences in risk cognition. Then, a cognitive decision-making model based on the drift diffusion model (DDM) is introduced to capture common decision-making mechanisms in high-risk environments. The DDM dynamically adjusts decision thresholds by integrating initial bias, drift rate, and boundary parameters, adapting to variations in speed, relative distance, and risk sensitivity to reflect diverse driving styles and risk preferences. By simulating high-risk scenarios with lateral, longitudinal, and multidimensional risk sources in a driving simulator, the proposed model accurately predicts cognitive responses and decision behaviors during emergency maneuvers. Specifically, by incorporating driver-specific risk sensitivity, the model enables dynamic adjustments of key DDM parameters, allowing for personalized decision-making representations in diverse scenarios. Comparative analysis with IDM, Gipps, and MOBIL demonstrates that DDM more precisely captures human cognitive processes and adaptive decision-making in high-risk scenarios. These findings provide a theoretical basis for modeling human driving behavior and offer critical insights for enhancing AV-human interaction in real-world traffic environments.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Traditionally, tiles have been constructed manually, a method that poses significant limitations in scalability and flexibility. Recent research has attempted to automate this process using generative models. However, current approaches primarily focus on tiling textures and manipulating models for single-image generation, without inherently supporting the creation of multiple interconnected tiles across diverse domains. This paper presents Tiled Diffusion, a novel approach that extends the capabilities of diffusion models to accommodate the generation of cohesive tiling patterns across various domains of image synthesis that require tiling. Our method supports a wide range of tiling scenarios, from self-tiling to complex many-to-many connections, enabling seamless integration of multiple images. Tiled Diffusion automates the tiling process, eliminating the need for manual intervention and enhancing creative possibilities in various applications, such as seamlessly tiling of existing images, tiled texture creation, and 360$^\circ$ synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our website for more information and the code: https://madaror.github.io/tiled-diffusion.github.io/</p></details> |

Recent training-free approaches, while exhibit higher computational efficiency than training-based methods, struggle with identity preservation, applicability, and compatibility with diffusion transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we uncover the untapped potential of DiT, where simply replacing denoising tokens with those of a reference subject achieves zero-shot subject reconstruction. This simple yet effective feature injection technique unlocks diverse scenarios, from personalization to image editing. Building upon this observation, we propose \textbf{Personalize Anything}, a training-free framework that achieves personalized image generation in DiT through: 1) timestep-adaptive token replacement that enforces subject consistency via early-stage injection and enhances flexibility through late-stage regularization, and 2) patch perturbation strategies to boost structural diversity. Our method seamlessly supports layout-guided generation, multi-subject personalization, and mask-controlled editing. Evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation and versatility. Our work establishes new insights into DiTs while delivering a practical paradigm for efficient personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://fenghora.github.io/Personalize-Anything-Page/</p></details> |

Although existing methods have shown great performance in generating entire graphs for graph-level learning tasks, no graph diffusion models have been developed to generate synthetic graph structures, that is, synthetic nodes and associated edges within a given graph, for node-level learning tasks. Inspired by the research in the computer vision literature using synthetic data for enhanced performance, we propose Diffusion on Graph (DoG), which generates synthetic graph structures to boost the performance of GNNs. The synthetic graph structures generated by DoG are combined with the original graph to form an augmented graph for the training of node-level learning tasks, such as node classification and graph contrastive learning (GCL). To improve the efficiency of the generation process, a Bi-Level Neighbor Map Decoder (BLND) is introduced in DoG. To mitigate the adverse effect of the noise introduced by the synthetic graph structures, a low-rank regularization method is proposed for the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) on the augmented graphs. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets for semi-supervised node classification and graph contrastive learning have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of DoG with low-rank regularization.

However, since these models are data-driven, they inherit biases from the training datasets, frequently leading to disproportionate group representations that exacerbate societal inequities. Traditionally, efforts to debiase these models have relied on predefined sensitive attributes, classifiers trained on such attributes, or large language models to steer outputs toward fairness. However, these approaches face notable drawbacks: predefined attributes do not adequately capture complex and continuous variations among groups. To address these issues, we introduce the Debiasing Diffusion Model (DDM), which leverages an indicator to learn latent representations during training, promoting fairness through balanced representations without requiring predefined sensitive attributes. This approach not only demonstrates its effectiveness in scenarios previously addressed by conventional techniques but also enhances fairness without relying on predefined sensitive attributes as conditions. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of prior bias mitigation techniques in diffusion-based models, elaborate on the architecture of the DDM, and validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments.</p></details> |  |

Our method necessitates no training, fine-tuning, text conditioning, or hyperparameter adjustments, yet it consistently reconstructs low-light images with superior fidelity. Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion prior, learned from training on a large collection of natural images, and the features present in the model itself to guide the inference, in contrast to existing methods that depend on customized constraints. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms SOTA methods on established datasets, while qualitative analyses indicate enhanced color accuracy and the rectification of subtle chromatic deviations. Furthermore, additional experiments reveal that our method, without any modifications, achieves SOTA-comparable performance in the auto white balance (AWB) task.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method, termed PLADIS, which boosts pre-trained models (U-Net/Transformer) by leveraging sparse attention. Specifically, we extrapolate query-key correlations using softmax and its sparse counterpart in the cross-attention layer during inference, without requiring extra training or NFEs. By leveraging the noise robustness of sparse attention, our PLADIS unleashes the latent potential of text-to-image diffusion models, enabling them to excel in areas where they once struggled with newfound effectiveness.

Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing GravMAD with more flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. Evaluations on real-world robotic tasks further show that GravMAD can reason about real-world tasks, associate them with relevant visual information, and generalize to novel tasks. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation.

Existing methods primarily focus on minimizing distortion between the transmitted image and the reconstructed version at the receiver, often overlooking perceptual quality. This can lead to severe perceptual degradation when transmitting images under extreme conditions, such as low bandwidth compression ratios (BCRs) and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this work, we propose SING, a novel two-stage JSCC framework that formulates the recovery of high-quality source images from corrupted reconstructions as an inverse problem. Depending on the availability of information about the DeepJSCC encoder/decoder and the channel at the receiver, SING can either approximate the stochastic degradation as a linear transformation, or leverage invertible neural networks (INNs) for precise modeling. Both approaches enable the seamless integration of diffusion models into the reconstruction process, enhancing perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate that SING outperforms DeepJSCC and other approaches, delivering superior perceptual quality even under extremely challenging conditions, including scenarios with significant distribution mismatches between the training and test data.</p></details> |  |

In Visible-Infrared person Re-IDentification (VI-ReID) tasks, collecting and annotating large-scale images of each individual under various cameras and modalities is tedious, time-expensive, costly and must comply with data protection laws, posing a severe challenge in meeting dataset requirements. Current research investigates the generation of synthetic data as an efficient and privacy-ensuring alternative to collecting real data in the field. However, a specific data synthesis technique tailored for VI-ReID models has yet to be explored. In this paper, we present a novel data generation framework, dubbed Diffusion-based VI-ReID data Expansion (DiVE), that automatically obtain massive RGB-IR paired images with identity preserving by decoupling identity and modality to improve the performance of VI-ReID models. Specifically, identity representation is acquired from a set of samples sharing the same ID, whereas the modality of images is learned by fine-tuning the Stable Diffusion (SD) on modality-specific data. DiVE extend the text-driven image synthesis to identity-preserving RGB-IR multimodal image synthesis. This approach significantly reduces data collection and annotation costs by directly incorporating synthetic data into ReID model training. Experiments have demonstrated that VI-ReID models trained on synthetic data produced by DiVE consistently exhibit notable enhancements. In particular, the state-of-the-art method, CAJ, trained with synthetic images, achieves an improvement of about $9\%$ in mAP over the baseline on the LLCM dataset.

However, current DPs are often based on a single visual modality (e.g., RGB or point cloud), limiting their accuracy and generalization potential. Although training a generalized DP capable of handling heterogeneous multimodal data would enhance performance, it entails substantial computational and data-related costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel policy composition method: by leveraging multiple pre-trained DPs based on individual visual modalities, we can combine their distributional scores to form a more expressive Modality-Composable Diffusion Policy (MCDP), without the need for additional training. Through extensive empirical experiments on the RoboTwin dataset, we demonstrate the potential of MCDP to improve both adaptability and performance. This exploration aims to provide valuable insights into the flexible composition of existing DPs, facilitating the development of generalizable cross-modality, cross-domain, and even cross-embodiment policies.

GGM deploys a discrete Markov chain called the heat bath dynamics (or the Glauber dynamics) to denoise a sequence of noisy tokens to a sample from a joint distribution of discrete tokens. Our novel conceptual framework provides an exact reduction of the task of learning the denoising Markov chain to solving a class of binary classification tasks. More specifically, the model learns to classify a given token in a noisy sequence as signal or noise. In contrast, prior works on discrete diffusion models either solve regression problems to learn importance ratios, or minimize loss functions given by variational approximations. We apply GGM to language modeling and image generation, where images are discretized using image tokenizers like VQGANs. We show that it outperforms existing discrete diffusion models in language generation, and demonstrates strong performance for image generation without using dataset-specific image tokenizers. We also show that our model is capable of performing well in zero-shot control settings like text and image infilling.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

In this work, we propose a co-learning framework that jointly optimizes a single-step diffusion-based upsampler and a learnable downsampler, enhanced by two discriminators and a cyclic distillation strategy. Our learnable downsampler is designed to better capture realistic degradation patterns while preserving structural details in the LR domain, which is crucial for enhancing SR performance. By leveraging a diffusion-based approach, our model generates diverse LR-HR pairs during training, enabling robust learning across varying degradations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both general real-world and domain-specific face SR tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Our approach not only improves efficiency with a single inference step but also ensures high-quality image reconstruction, bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world SR scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherently iterative nature of diffusion-based inverse algorithms often requires hundreds to thousands of steps, with performance degradation occurring under fewer steps which limits their practical applicability. While high-order diffusion ODE solvers have been extensively explored for efficient diffusion sampling without observations, their application to inverse problems remains underexplored due to the diverse forms of inverse algorithms and their need for repeated trajectory correction based on observations. To address this gap, we first introduce a canonical form that decomposes existing diffusion-based inverse algorithms into three modules to unify their analysis. Inspired by the linear subspace search strategy in the design of high-order diffusion ODE solvers, we propose the Learnable Linear Extrapolation (LLE) method, a lightweight approach that universally enhances the performance of any diffusion-based inverse algorithm that fits the proposed canonical form.

| **[TextDiff: Mask-Guided Residual Diffusion Models for Scene Text Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06743v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of scene text image super-resolution is to reconstruct high-resolution text-line images from unrecognizable low-resolution inputs. The existing methods relying on the optimization of pixel-level loss tend to yield text edges that exhibit a notable degree of blurring, thereby exerting a substantial impact on both the readability and recognizability of the text. To address these issues, we propose TextDiff, the first diffusion-based framework tailored for scene text image super-resolution. It contains two modules: the Text Enhancement Module (TEM) and the Mask-Guided Residual Diffusion Module (MRD). The TEM generates an initial deblurred text image and a mask that encodes the spatial location of the text. The MRD is responsible for effectively sharpening the text edge by modeling the residuals between the ground-truth images and the initial deblurred images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TextDiff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on public benchmark datasets and can improve the readability of scene text images. Moreover, our proposed MRD module is plug-and-play that effectively sharpens the text edges produced by SOTA methods. This enhancement not only improves the readability and recognizability of the results generated by SOTA methods but also does not require any additional joint training.

To address these issues, we propose MExD, an Expert-Infused Diffusion Model that combines the strengths of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with a diffusion model for enhanced classification. MExD balances patch feature distribution through a novel MoE-based aggregator that selectively emphasizes relevant information, effectively filtering noise, addressing data imbalance, and extracting essential features. These features are then integrated via a diffusion-based generative process to directly yield the class distribution for the WSI. Moving beyond conventional discriminative approaches, MExD represents the first generative strategy in WSI classification, capturing fine-grained details for robust and precise results. Our MExD is validated on three widely-used benchmarks-Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and BRACS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in both binary and multi-class tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[Localized Concept Erasure for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using Training-Free Gated Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12356v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning based concept erasing has demonstrated promising results in preventing generation of harmful contents from text-to-image diffusion models by removing target concepts while preserving remaining concepts. To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[MDiff-FMT: Morphology-aware Diffusion Model for Fluorescence Molecular Tomography with Small-scale Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06757v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) is a sensitive optical imaging technology widely used in biomedical research. However, the ill-posedness of the inverse problem poses a huge challenge to FMT reconstruction. Although end-to-end deep learning algorithms have been widely used to address this critical issue, they still suffer from high data dependency and poor morphological restoration. In this paper, we report for the first time a morphology-aware diffusion model, MDiff-FMT, based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to achieve high-fidelity morphological reconstruction for FMT. First, we use the noise addition of DDPM to simulate the process of the gradual degradation of morphological features, and achieve fine-grained reconstruction of morphological features through a stepwise probabilistic sampling mechanism, avoiding problems such as loss of structure details that may occur in end-to-end deep learning methods. Additionally, we introduce the conditional fluorescence image as structural prior information to sample a high-fidelity reconstructed image from the noisy images. Numerous numerical and real phantom experimental results show that the proposed MDiff-FMT achieves SOTA results in morphological reconstruction of FMT without relying on large-scale datasets.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Lan-o3dp, a language-guided object-centric diffusion policy framework that can adapt to unseen situations such as cluttered scenes, shifting camera views, and ambiguous similar objects while offering training-free collision avoidance and achieving a high success rate with few demonstrations. We train a diffusion model conditioned on 3D point clouds of task-relevant objects to predict the robot's end-effector trajectories, enabling it to complete the tasks. During inference, we incorporate cost optimization into denoising steps to guide the generated trajectory to be collision-free. We leverage open-set segmentation to obtain the 3D point clouds of related objects. We use a large language model to identify the target objects and possible obstacles by interpreting the user's natural language instructions. To effectively guide the conditional diffusion model using a time-independent cost function, we proposed a novel guided generation mechanism based on the estimated clean trajectories. In the simulation, we showed that diffusion policy based on the object-centric 3D representation achieves a much higher success rate (68.7%) compared to baselines with simple 2D (39.3%) and 3D scene (43.6%) representations across 21 challenging RLBench tasks with only 40 demonstrations. In real-world experiments, we extensively evaluated the generalization in various unseen situations and validated the effectiveness of the proposed zero-shot cost-guided collision avoidance.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Reflect-DiT: Inference-Time Scaling for Text-to-Image Diffusion Transformers via In-Context Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12271v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The predominant approach to advancing text-to-image generation has been training-time scaling, where larger models are trained on more data using greater computational resources. While effective, this approach is computationally expensive, leading to growing interest in inference-time scaling to improve performance. Currently, inference-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models is largely limited to best-of-N sampling, where multiple images are generated per prompt and a selection model chooses the best output. Inspired by the recent success of reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 in the language domain, we introduce an alternative to naive best-of-N sampling by equipping text-to-image Diffusion Transformers with in-context reflection capabilities. We propose Reflect-DiT, a method that enables Diffusion Transformers to refine their generations using in-context examples of previously generated images alongside textual feedback describing necessary improvements. Instead of passively relying on random sampling and hoping for a better result in a future generation, Reflect-DiT explicitly tailors its generations to address specific aspects requiring enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that Reflect-DiT improves performance on the GenEval benchmark (+0.19) using SANA-1.0-1.6B as a base model. Additionally, it achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 0.81 on GenEval while generating only 20 samples per prompt, surpassing the previous best score of 0.80, which was obtained using a significantly larger model (SANA-1.5-4.8B) with 2048 samples under the best-of-N approach.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[ITVTON: Virtual Try-On Diffusion Transformer Based on Integrated Image and Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16757v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on task, grounded in persons and garments, has produced notable advancements in the domain of diffusion models. Numerous approaches use replicated backbones or additional image encoders to extract garment features, leading to higher computational cost and a more complex network structure. In this work, we introduce ITVTON, which utilizes the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as a generator to enhance image quality. ITVTON also improves garment-person interaction by stitching garment and person images along the spatial channel, and integrates textual descriptions from both the garment and person images to further enhance the realism of the generated visuals. This network structure is efficient, and to further reduce computational cost, we constrain training to attention parameters within a single Diffusion Transformer (Single-DiT) block. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITVTON outperforms baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, thereby establishing a new benchmark for virtual try-on tasks.Additionally, 10,257 image pairs were selected from IGPair to demonstrate that ITVTON performs effectively in realistic scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Modal Diffusion for Biomechanical Dynamical Systems Through Local Manifold Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12214v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a mutually aligned diffusion framework for cross-modal biomechanical motion generation, guided by a dynamical systems perspective. By treating each modality, e.g., observed joint angles ($X$) and ground reaction forces ($Y$), as complementary observations of a shared underlying locomotor dynamical system, our method aligns latent representations at each diffusion step, so that one modality can help denoise and disambiguate the other. Our alignment approach is motivated by the fact that local time windows of $X$ and $Y$ represent the same phase of an underlying dynamical system, thereby benefiting from a shared latent manifold. We introduce a simple local latent manifold alignment (LLMA) strategy that incorporates first-order and second-order alignment within the latent space for robust cross-modal biomechanical generation without bells and whistles. Through experiments on multimodal human biomechanics data, we show that aligning local latent dynamics across modalities improves generation fidelity and yields better representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAY Diffusion: Styled Layout Diffusion Model for Diverse Layout-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12213v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In layout-to-image (L2I) synthesis, controlled complex scenes are generated from coarse information like bounding boxes. Such a task is exciting to many downstream applications because the input layouts offer strong guidance to the generation process while remaining easily reconfigurable by humans. In this paper, we proposed STyled LAYout Diffusion (STAY Diffusion), a diffusion-based model that produces photo-realistic images and provides fine-grained control of stylized objects in scenes. Our approach learns a global condition for each layout, and a self-supervised semantic map for weight modulation using a novel Edge-Aware Normalization (EA Norm). A new Styled-Mask Attention (SM Attention) is also introduced to cross-condition the global condition and image feature for capturing the objects' relationships. These measures provide consistent guidance through the model, enabling more accurate and controllable image generation. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that our STAY Diffusion presents high-quality images while surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods in generation diversity, accuracy, and controllability.</p></details> | Accepted by WACV2025 |
| **[D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a score function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes the deformation from the previous round with this denoising process, allows \textit{anytime} refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI, approximately three times faster in a 3D holonomic case with 16 robots. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffAD: A Unified Diffusion Modeling Approach for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12170v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has rapidly emerged as a promising approach toward achieving full autonomy. However, existing E2E-AD systems typically adopt a traditional multi-task framework, addressing perception, prediction, and planning tasks through separate task-specific heads. Despite being trained in a fully differentiable manner, they still encounter issues with task coordination, and the system complexity remains high. In this work, we introduce DiffAD, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that redefines autonomous driving as a conditional image generation task. By rasterizing heterogeneous targets onto a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) and modeling their latent distribution, DiffAD unifies various driving objectives and jointly optimizes all driving tasks in a single framework, significantly reducing system complexity and harmonizing task coordination. The reverse process iteratively refines the generated BEV image, resulting in more robust and realistic driving behaviors. Closed-loop evaluations in Carla demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, achieving a new state-of-the-art Success Rate and Driving Score. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[DiffGAP: A Lightweight Diffusion Module in Contrastive Space for Bridging Cross-Model Gap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12131v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works in cross-modal understanding and generation, notably through models like CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) and CAVP (Contrastive Audio-Visual Pretraining), have significantly enhanced the alignment of text, video, and audio embeddings via a single contrastive loss. However, these methods often overlook the bidirectional interactions and inherent noises present in each modality, which can crucially impact the quality and efficacy of cross-modal integration. To address this limitation, we introduce DiffGAP, a novel approach incorporating a lightweight generative module within the contrastive space. Specifically, our DiffGAP employs a bidirectional diffusion process tailored to bridge the cross-modal gap more effectively. This involves a denoising process on text and video embeddings conditioned on audio embeddings and vice versa, thus facilitating a more nuanced and robust cross-modal interaction. Our experimental results on VGGSound and AudioCaps datasets demonstrate that DiffGAP significantly improves performance in video/text-audio generation and retrieval tasks, confirming its effectiveness in enhancing cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Speech-to-Video Synthesis Approach Using Spatio-Temporal Diffusion for Vocal Tract MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12102v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between vocal tract motion during speech and the resulting acoustic signal is crucial for aided clinical assessment and developing personalized treatment and rehabilitation strategies. Toward this goal, we introduce an audio-to-video generation framework for creating Real Time/cine-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (RT-/cine-MRI) visuals of the vocal tract from speech signals. Our framework first preprocesses RT-/cine-MRI sequences and speech samples to achieve temporal alignment, ensuring synchronization between visual and audio data. We then employ a modified stable diffusion model, integrating structural and temporal blocks, to effectively capture movement characteristics and temporal dynamics in the synchronized data. This process enables the generation of MRI sequences from new speech inputs, improving the conversion of audio into visual data. We evaluated our framework on healthy controls and tongue cancer patients by analyzing and comparing the vocal tract movements in synthesized videos. Our framework demonstrated adaptability to new speech inputs and effective generalization. In addition, positive human evaluations confirmed its effectiveness, with realistic and accurate visualizations, suggesting its potential for outpatient therapy and personalized simulation of vocal tract visualizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[TACO: Taming Diffusion for in-the-wild Video Amodal Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12049v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can infer complete shapes and appearances of objects from limited visual cues, relying on extensive prior knowledge of the physical world. However, completing partially observable objects while ensuring consistency across video frames remains challenging for existing models, especially for unstructured, in-the-wild videos. This paper tackles the task of Video Amodal Completion (VAC), which aims to generate the complete object consistently throughout the video given a visual prompt specifying the object of interest. Leveraging the rich, consistent manifolds learned by pre-trained video diffusion models, we propose a conditional diffusion model, TACO, that repurposes these manifolds for VAC. To enable its effective and robust generalization to challenging in-the-wild scenarios, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset with multiple difficulty levels by systematically imposing occlusions onto un-occluded videos. Building on this, we devise a progressive fine-tuning paradigm that starts with simpler recovery tasks and gradually advances to more complex ones. We demonstrate TACO's versatility on a wide range of in-the-wild videos from Internet, as well as on diverse, unseen datasets commonly used in autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and scene understanding. Moreover, we show that TACO can be effectively applied to various downstream tasks like object reconstruction and pose estimation, highlighting its potential to facilitate physical world understanding and reasoning.

We propose the Quadtree Diffusion Model (QDM), a region-adaptive diffusion framework that leverages a quadtree structure to selectively enhance detail-rich regions while reducing computations in homogeneous areas. By guiding the diffusion with a quadtree derived from the low-quality input, QDM identifies key regions-represented by leaf nodes-where fine detail is essential and applies minimal refinement elsewhere. This mask-guided, two-stream architecture adaptively balances quality and efficiency, producing high-fidelity outputs with low computational redundancy. Experiments demonstrate QDM's effectiveness in high-resolution SR tasks across diverse image types, particularly in medical imaging (e.g., CT scans), where large homogeneous regions are prevalent. Furthermore, QDM outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art SR methods on standard benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs, highlighting its efficiency and suitability for resource-limited environments.

However, existing privacy evaluations often rely on heuristic metrics or weak membership inference attacks (MIA), leaving privacy risks inadequately assessed. In this work, we conduct a rigorous MIA study on diffusion-based tabular synthesis, revealing that state-of-the-art attacks designed for image models fail in this setting. We identify noise initialization as a key factor influencing attack efficacy and propose a machine-learning-driven approach that leverages loss features across different noises and time steps. Our method, implemented with a lightweight MLP, effectively learns membership signals, eliminating the need for manual optimization. Experimental results from the MIDST Challenge @ SaTML 2025 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, securing first place across all tracks.

| **[Diffusion Dynamics Models with Generative State Estimation for Cloth Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11999v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating deformable objects like cloth is challenging due to their complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate state estimation and dynamics modeling. Prior work has struggled with robust cloth state estimation, while dynamics models, primarily based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are limited by their locality. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Building on this insight, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing the full cloth state from sparse RGB-D observations conditioned on a canonical cloth mesh and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves high-fidelity state reconstruction while reducing long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to GNN-based approaches. Integrated with model-predictive control (MPC), our framework successfully executes cloth folding on a real robotic system, demonstrating the potential of generative models for manipulation tasks with partial observability and complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We present MoDM, a novel caching-based serving system for diffusion models that dynamically balances latency and quality through a mixture of diffusion models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on model-specific internal features, MoDM caches final images, allowing seamless retrieval and reuse across multiple diffusion model families. This design enables adaptive serving by dynamically balancing latency and image quality: using smaller models for cache-hit requests to reduce latency while reserving larger models for cache-miss requests to maintain quality. Small model image quality is preserved using retrieved cached images. We design a global monitor that optimally allocates GPU resources and balances inference workload, ensuring high throughput while meeting service-level objectives under varying request rates. Our evaluations show that MoDM significantly reduces average serving time by 2.5x while retaining image quality, making it a practical solution for scalable and resource-efficient model deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, enabling precise control of continuous attributes, especially multiple attributes simultaneously, in a new domain (e.g., numeric values like eye openness or car width) with text-only guidance remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Attribute (Att) Adapter, a novel plug-and-play module designed to enable fine-grained, multi-attributes control in pretrained diffusion models. Our approach learns a single control adapter from a set of sample images that can be unpaired and contain multiple visual attributes. The Att-Adapter leverages the decoupled cross attention module to naturally harmonize the multiple domain attributes with text conditioning. We further introduce Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to the Att-Adapter to mitigate overfitting, matching the diverse nature of the visual world. Evaluations on two public datasets show that Att-Adapter outperforms all LoRA-based baselines in controlling continuous attributes. Additionally, our method enables a broader control range and also improves disentanglement across multiple attributes, surpassing StyleGAN-based techniques. Notably, Att-Adapter is flexible, requiring no paired synthetic data for training, and is easily scalable to multiple attributes within a single model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Upcycling Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Multi-Task Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11905v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image synthesis has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years. Many attempts have been made to adopt text-to-image models to support multiple tasks. However, existing approaches typically require resource-intensive re-training or additional parameters to accommodate for the new tasks, which makes the model inefficient for on-device deployment. We propose Multi-Task Upcycling (MTU), a simple yet effective recipe that extends the capabilities of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to support a variety of image-to-image generation tasks. MTU replaces Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers in the diffusion model with smaller FFNs, referred to as experts, and combines them with a dynamic routing mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, MTU is the first multi-task diffusion modeling approach that seamlessly blends multi-tasking with on-device compatibility, by mitigating the issue of parameter inflation. We show that the performance of MTU is on par with the single-task fine-tuned diffusion models across several tasks including image editing, super-resolution, and inpainting, while maintaining similar latency and computational load (GFLOPs) as the single-task fine-tuned models.</p></details> | Preprint |

While existing kinematics motion generation with diffusion models offer intuitive steering capabilities with inference-time conditioning, they often fail to produce physically viable motions. In contrast, recent diffusion-based control policies have shown promise in generating physically realizable motion sequences, but the lack of kinematics prediction limits their steerability. Diffuse-CLoC addresses these challenges through a key insight: modeling the joint distribution of states and actions within a single diffusion model makes action generation steerable by conditioning it on the predicted states. This approach allows us to leverage established conditioning techniques from kinematic motion generation while producing physically realistic motions. As a result, we achieve planning capabilities without the need for a high-level planner. Our method handles a diverse set of unseen long-horizon downstream tasks through a single pre-trained model, including static and dynamic obstacle avoidance, motion in-betweening, and task-space control. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the traditional hierarchical framework of high-level motion diffusion and low-level tracking.</p></details> |  |

In ligand-based drug design, bioisosteric analogues of known bioactive hits are often identified by virtually screening chemical libraries with shape, electrostatic, and pharmacophore similarity scoring functions. We instead hypothesize that a generative model which learns the joint distribution over 3D molecular structures and their interaction profiles may facilitate 3D interaction-aware chemical design. We specifically design ShEPhERD, an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model which jointly diffuses/denoises 3D molecular graphs and representations of their shapes, electrostatic potential surfaces, and (directional) pharmacophores to/from Gaussian noise. Inspired by traditional ligand discovery, we compose 3D similarity scoring functions to assess ShEPhERD's ability to conditionally generate novel molecules with desired interaction profiles. We demonstrate ShEPhERD's potential for impact via exemplary drug design tasks including natural product ligand hopping, protein-blind bioactive hit diversification, and bioisosteric fragment merging.</p></details> |  |

Conventional approaches, such as real-world test drives, are not only expensive but also lack the flexibility to capture targeted edge cases for thorough evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a controllable latent diffusion that guides the training of diffusion models via reinforcement learning to automatically generate a diverse and controllable set of driving scenarios for virtual testing. Our approach removes the reliance on large-scale real-world data by generating complex scenarios whose properties can be finely tuned to challenge and assess autonomous vehicle systems. Experimental results show that our approach has the lowest collision rate of $0.098$ and lowest off-road rate of $0.096$, demonstrating superiority over existing baselines. The proposed approach significantly improves the realism, stability and controllability of the generated scenarios, enabling more nuanced safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages,2 figures, submitted to IROS conference</p></details> |

We evaluate a range of DiT-based architectures--including PixArt-style and MMDiT variants--and compare them with a standard DiT variant which directly processes concatenated text and noise inputs. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that the performance of standard DiT is comparable with those specialized models, while demonstrating superior parameter-efficiency, especially when scaled up. Leveraging the layer-wise parameter sharing strategy, we achieve a further reduction of 66% in model size compared to an MMDiT architecture, with minimal performance impact. Building on an in-depth analysis of critical components such as text encoders and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), we introduce DiT-Air and DiT-Air-Lite. With supervised and reward fine-tuning, DiT-Air achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval and T2I CompBench, while DiT-Air-Lite remains highly competitive, surpassing most existing models despite its compact size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Few-Call Model Stealing via Active Self-Paced Knowledge Distillation and Diffusion-Based Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00096v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models showcase strong capabilities in image synthesis, being used in many computer vision tasks with great success. To this end, we propose to explore a new use case, namely to copy black-box classification models without having access to the original training data, the architecture, and the weights of the model, i.e. the model is only exposed through an inference API. More specifically, we can only observe the (soft or hard) labels for some image samples passed as input to the model. Furthermore, we consider an additional constraint limiting the number of model calls, mostly focusing our research on few-call model stealing. In order to solve the model extraction task given the applied restrictions, we propose the following framework. As training data, we create a synthetic data set (called proxy data set) by leveraging the ability of diffusion models to generate realistic and diverse images. Given a maximum number of allowed API calls, we pass the respective number of samples through the black-box model to collect labels. Finally, we distill the knowledge of the black-box teacher (attacked model) into a student model (copy of the attacked model), harnessing both labeled and unlabeled data generated by the diffusion model. We employ a novel active self-paced learning framework to make the most of the proxy data during distillation. Our empirical results on three data sets confirm the superiority of our framework over four state-of-the-art methods in the few-call model extraction scenario. We release our code for free non-commercial use at https://github.com/vladhondru25/model-stealing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Artificial Intelligence Review</p></details> |
| **[Bottom-up Iterative Anomalous Diffusion Detector (BI-ADD)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11529v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the segmentation of short molecular trajectories with varying diffusive properties has drawn particular attention of researchers, since it allows studying the dynamics of a particle. In the past decade, machine learning methods have shown highly promising results, also in changepoint detection and segmentation tasks. Here, we introduce a novel iterative method to identify the changepoints in a molecular trajectory, i.e., frames, where the diffusive behavior of a particle changes. A trajectory in our case follows a fractional Brownian motion and we estimate the diffusive properties of the trajectories. The proposed BI-ADD combines unsupervised and supervised learning methods to detect the changepoints. Our approach can be used for the analysis of molecular trajectories at the individual level and also be extended to multiple particle tracking, which is an important challenge in fundamental biology. We validated BI-ADD in various scenarios within the framework of the AnDi2 Challenge 2024 dedicated to single particle tracking. Our method is implemented in Python and is publicly available for research purposes.</p></details> |  |

This paper identifies three trade-offs challenging the diffusion of conventions: (I) the trade-off between the imperatives of social, sequential, and contextual consistency that individuals balance when choosing between conventions; (II) the competition between local and global coordination, depending on whether individuals coordinate their behavior via interactions throughout a social network or external factors transcending the network; and (III) the balance between decision optimality (e.g., collective satisfaction) and decision costs when collectives with conflicting preferences choose a convention. We develop a broadly applicable statistical physics framework for measuring each of these trade-offs, which we then apply to a sign convention in physics. Our method can recover the structure of the underlying coordination game, the networks of social interactions involved, and the processes through which conflicts are resolved in collaborations. We find that the purpose of conventions may exceed coordination, and that individual preferences towards conventions are concurrently shaped by cultural factors and multiple social networks. Additionally, we reveal the role of leadership in the resolution of conflicts. Finally, this work provides a generalization of Lewis' account of conventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards A Correct Usage of Cryptography in Semantic Watermarks for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11404v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic watermarking methods enable the direct integration of watermarks into the generation process of latent diffusion models by only modifying the initial latent noise. One line of approaches building on Gaussian Shading relies on cryptographic primitives to steer the sampling process of the latent noise. However, we identify several issues in the usage of cryptographic techniques in Gaussian Shading, particularly in its proof of lossless performance and key management, causing ambiguity in follow-up works, too. In this work, we therefore revisit the cryptographic primitives for semantic watermarking. We introduce a novel, general proof of lossless performance based on IND\$-CPA security for semantic watermarks. We then discuss the configuration of the cryptographic primitives in semantic watermarks with respect to security, efficiency, and generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, WMark@ICLR</p></details> |
| **[BEVDiffLoc: End-to-End LiDAR Global Localization in BEV View based on Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11372v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localization is one of the core parts of modern robotics. Classic localization methods typically follow the retrieve-then-register paradigm, achieving remarkable success. Recently, the emergence of end-to-end localization approaches has offered distinct advantages, including a streamlined system architecture and the elimination of the need to store extensive map data. Although these methods have demonstrated promising results, current end-to-end localization approaches still face limitations in robustness and accuracy. Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) image is one of the most widely adopted data representations in autonomous driving. It significantly reduces data complexity while preserving spatial structure and scale consistency, making it an ideal representation for localization tasks. However, research on BEV-based end-to-end localization remains notably insufficient. To fill this gap, we propose BEVDiffLoc, a novel framework that formulates LiDAR localization as a conditional generation of poses. Leveraging the properties of BEV, we first introduce a specific data augmentation method to significantly enhance the diversity of input data. Then, the Maximum Feature Aggregation Module and Vision Transformer are employed to learn robust features while maintaining robustness against significant rotational view variations. Finally, we incorporate a diffusion model that iteratively refines the learned features to recover the absolute pose. Extensive experiments on the Oxford Radar RobotCar and NCLT datasets demonstrate that BEVDiffLoc outperforms the baseline methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/BEVDiffLoc.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Diversity and Control in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10637v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilled diffusion models suffer from a critical limitation: reduced sample diversity compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we introduce Diffusion Target (DT) Visualization, an analysis and debugging tool that reveals how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through DT-Visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications.

| **[Data Pruning in Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12523v3)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data pruning is the problem of identifying a core subset that is most beneficial to training and discarding the remainder. While pruning strategies are well studied for discriminative models like those used in classification, little research has gone into their application to generative models. Generative models aim to estimate the underlying distribution of the data, so presumably they should benefit from larger datasets. In this work we aim to shed light on the accuracy of this statement, specifically answer the question of whether data pruning for generative diffusion models could have a positive impact. Contrary to intuition, we show that eliminating redundant or noisy data in large datasets is beneficial particularly when done strategically. We experiment with several pruning methods including recent-state-of-art methods, and evaluate over CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. We demonstrate that a simple clustering method outperforms other sophisticated and computationally demanding methods. We further exhibit how we can leverage clustering to balance skewed datasets in an unsupervised manner to allow fair sampling for underrepresented populations in the data distribution, which is a crucial problem in generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Diffusion Knowledge for Generative Image Compression with Fractal Frequency-Aware Band Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11321v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By optimizing the rate-distortion-realism trade-off, generative image compression approaches produce detailed, realistic images instead of the only sharp-looking reconstructions produced by rate-distortion-optimized models. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based generative image compression method injected with diffusion knowledge, obtaining the capacity to recover more realistic textures in practical scenarios. Efforts are made from three perspectives to navigate the rate-distortion-realism trade-off in the generative image compression task. First, recognizing the strong connection between image texture and frequency-domain characteristics, we design a Fractal Frequency-Aware Band Image Compression (FFAB-IC) network to effectively capture the directional frequency components inherent in natural images. This network integrates commonly used fractal band feature operations within a neural non-linear mapping design, enhancing its ability to retain essential given information and filter out unnecessary details. Then, to improve the visual quality of image reconstruction under limited bandwidth, we integrate diffusion knowledge into the encoder and implement diffusion iterations into the decoder process, thus effectively recovering lost texture details. Finally, to fully leverage the spatial and frequency intensity information, we incorporate frequency- and content-aware regularization terms to regularize the training of the generative image compression network. Extensive experiments in quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, advancing the boundaries of achievable distortion-realism pairs, i.e., our method achieves better distortions at high realism and better realism at low distortion than ever before.</p></details> |  |
| **[CreatiLayout: Siamese Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for Creative Layout-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03859v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been recognized for their ability to generate images that are not only visually appealing but also of high artistic quality. As a result, Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation has been proposed to leverage region-specific positions and descriptions to enable more precise and controllable generation. However, previous methods primarily focus on UNet-based models (e.g., SD1.5 and SDXL), and limited effort has explored Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs), which have demonstrated powerful image generation capabilities. Enabling MM-DiT for layout-to-image generation seems straightforward but is challenging due to the complexity of how layout is introduced, integrated, and balanced among multiple modalities. To this end, we explore various network variants to efficiently incorporate layout guidance into MM-DiT, and ultimately present SiamLayout. To Inherit the advantages of MM-DiT, we use a separate set of network weights to process the layout, treating it as equally important as the image and text modalities. Meanwhile, to alleviate the competition among modalities, we decouple the image-layout interaction into a siamese branch alongside the image-text one and fuse them in the later stage. Moreover, we contribute a large-scale layout dataset, named LayoutSAM, which includes 2.7 million image-text pairs and 10.7 million entities. Each entity is annotated with a bounding box and a detailed description. We further construct the LayoutSAM-Eval benchmark as a comprehensive tool for evaluating the L2I generation quality. Finally, we introduce the Layout Designer, which taps into the potential of large language models in layout planning, transforming them into experts in layout generation and optimization. Our code, model, and dataset will be available at https://creatilayout.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter estimation for partially observed second-order diffusion processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14738v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating parameters of a diffusion process given continuous-time observations of the process via maximum likelihood approaches or, online, via stochastic gradient descent or Kalman filter formulations constitutes a well-established research area. It has also been established previously that these techniques are, in general, not robust to perturbations in the data in the form of temporal correlations of the driving noise. While the subject is relatively well understood and appropriate modifications have been suggested in the context of multi-scale diffusion processes and their reduced model equations, we consider here an alternative but related setting where a diffusion process in positions and velocities is only observed via its positions. In this note, we propose a simple modification to standard stochastic gradient descent and Kalman filter formulations, which eliminates the arising systematic estimation biases. The modification can be extended to standard maximum likelihood approaches and avoids computation of previously proposed correction terms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise Synthesis for Low-Light Image Denoising with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11262v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light photography produces images with low signal-to-noise ratios due to limited photons. In such conditions, common approximations like the Gaussian noise model fall short, and many denoising techniques fail to remove noise effectively. Although deep-learning methods perform well, they require large datasets of paired images that are impractical to acquire. As a remedy, synthesizing realistic low-light noise has gained significant attention. In this paper, we investigate the ability of diffusion models to capture the complex distribution of low-light noise. We show that a naive application of conventional diffusion models is inadequate for this task and propose three key adaptations that enable high-precision noise generation without calibration or post-processing: a two-branch architecture to better model signal-dependent and signal-independent noise, the incorporation of positional information to capture fixed-pattern noise, and a tailored diffusion noise schedule. Consequently, our model enables the generation of large datasets for training low-light denoising networks, leading to state-of-the-art performance. Through comprehensive analysis, including statistical evaluation and noise decomposition, we provide deeper insights into the characteristics of the generated data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decouple-Then-Merge: Finetune Diffusion Models as Multi-Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06664v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are trained by learning a sequence of models that reverse each step of noise corruption. Typically, the model parameters are fully shared across multiple timesteps to enhance training efficiency. However, since the denoising tasks differ at each timestep, the gradients computed at different timesteps may conflict, potentially degrading the overall performance of image generation. To solve this issue, this work proposes a \textbf{De}couple-then-\textbf{Me}rge (\textbf{DeMe}) framework, which begins with a pretrained model and finetunes separate models tailored to specific timesteps. We introduce several improved techniques during the finetuning stage to promote effective knowledge sharing while minimizing training interference across timesteps. Finally, after finetuning, these separate models can be merged into a single model in the parameter space, ensuring efficient and practical inference. Experimental results show significant generation quality improvements upon 6 benchmarks including Stable Diffusion on COCO30K, ImageNet1K, PartiPrompts, and DDPM on LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, and CIFAR10.

| **[Towards Better Alignment: Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning Against Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11240v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation. However, their practical applications are hindered by the misalignment between generated images and corresponding text prompts. To tackle this issue, reinforcement learning (RL) has been considered for diffusion model fine-tuning. Yet, RL's effectiveness is limited by the challenge of sparse reward, where feedback is only available at the end of the generation process. This makes it difficult to identify which actions during the denoising process contribute positively to the final generated image, potentially leading to ineffective or unnecessary denoising policies. To this end, this paper presents a novel RL-based framework that addresses the sparse reward problem when training diffusion models. Our framework, named $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$, employs two strategies: \textbf{B}ackward progressive training and \textbf{B}ranch-based sampling. For one thing, backward progressive training focuses initially on the final timesteps of denoising process and gradually extends the training interval to earlier timesteps, easing the learning difficulty from sparse rewards. For another, we perform branch-based sampling for each training interval. By comparing the samples within the same branch, we can identify how much the policies of the current training interval contribute to the final image, which helps to learn effective policies instead of unnecessary ones. $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ is compatible with existing optimization algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ in improving prompt-image alignment and maintaining diversity in generated images.

A correction to the Riemann solver is introduced, designed to mitigate excessive numerical diffusion while maintaining simplicity and efficiency. The validity of this correction is established through rigorous asymptotic analysis of the governing equations and their discrete counterparts. The proposed correction is implemented within a six-equation model framework with instantaneous relaxation using an HLLC-type solver. Numerical test cases demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of the approach in capturing multiphase flow dynamics across a wide range of Mach numbers.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a multi-stage generative upscaling framework leveraging Diffusion Models to enhance degraded images, transforming inputs as small as $64 \times 64$ pixels into high-fidelity $1024 \times 1024$ outputs. By integrating an image-to-image pipeline, ControlNet conditioning, and LoRA fine-tuning, our approach surpasses traditional upscaling methods in restoring intricate textures and domain-specific elements such as player details and jersey logos. The custom LoRA is trained on a custom football dataset, ensuring adaptability to sports broadcast needs. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional models, with ControlNet refining fine details and LoRA enhancing task-specific elements. These findings highlight the potential of diffusion-based image reconstruction in sports media, paving the way for future applications in automated video enhancement and real-time sports analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriveGEN: Generalized and Robust 3D Detection in Driving via Controllable Text-to-Image Diffusion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11122v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, vision-centric 3D detection aims to identify 3D objects from images. However, high data collection costs and diverse real-world scenarios limit the scale of training data. Once distribution shifts occur between training and test data, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation, known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problems. To address this, controllable Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion offers a potential solution for training data enhancement, which is required to generate diverse OOD scenarios with precise 3D object geometry. Nevertheless, existing controllable T2I approaches are restricted by the limited scale of training data or struggle to preserve all annotated 3D objects. In this paper, we present DriveGEN, a method designed to improve the robustness of 3D detectors in Driving via Training-Free Controllable Text-to-Image Diffusion Generation. Without extra diffusion model training, DriveGEN consistently preserves objects with precise 3D geometry across diverse OOD generations, consisting of 2 stages: 1) Self-Prototype Extraction: We empirically find that self-attention features are semantic-aware but require accurate region selection for 3D objects. Thus, we extract precise object features via layouts to capture 3D object geometry, termed self-prototypes. 2) Prototype-Guided Diffusion: To preserve objects across various OOD scenarios, we perform semantic-aware feature alignment and shallow feature alignment during denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DriveGEN in improving 3D detection.

In materials development, it is costly to try many samples with different parameters in experiments and numerical simulations. The use of data-driven inverse design method can reduce the cost of materials development. This study develops an inverse analysis model that predicts process parameters and microstructures. This method can be used for any material, but in this study it is applied to polymeric material, which is the matrix resin of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics as an example. Matrix resins contain a mixture of dendrites, which are crystalline phases, and amorphous phases even after crystal growth is complete, and it is important to consider the microstructures consisting of the crystalline structure and the remaining amorphous phase to achieve the desired mechanical properties. Typically, the temperature during forming affects the microstructures, which in turn affect the macroscopic mechanical properties. The trained diffusion model can propose not only the processing temperature but also the microstructure when Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are given. The capability of our conditional diffusion model to represent complex dendrites is also noteworthy.</p></details> | 22pages, 22figures |
| **[StyleSSP: Sampling StartPoint Enhancement for Training-free Diffusion-based Method for Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11319v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-free diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable success in style transfer, eliminating the need for extensive training or fine-tuning. However, due to the lack of targeted training for style information extraction and constraints on the content image layout, training-free methods often suffer from layout changes of original content and content leakage from style images. Through a series of experiments, we discovered that an effective startpoint in the sampling stage significantly enhances the style transfer process. Based on this discovery, we propose StyleSSP, which focuses on obtaining a better startpoint to address layout changes of original content and content leakage from style image. StyleSSP comprises two key components: (1) Frequency Manipulation: To improve content preservation, we reduce the low-frequency components of the DDIM latent, allowing the sampling stage to pay more attention to the layout of content images; and (2) Negative Guidance via Inversion: To mitigate the content leakage from style image, we employ negative guidance in the inversion stage to ensure that the startpoint of the sampling stage is distanced from the content of style image. Experiments show that StyleSSP surpasses previous training-free style transfer baselines, particularly in preserving original content and minimizing the content leakage from style image.

Tokenizer training typically follows a standard recipe in which images are compressed and reconstructed subject to a combination of MSE, perceptual, and adversarial losses. Diffusion autoencoders have been proposed in prior work as a way to learn end-to-end perceptually-oriented image compression, but have not yet shown state-of-the-art performance on the competitive task of ImageNet-1K reconstruction. We propose FlowMo, a transformer-based diffusion autoencoder that achieves a new state-of-the-art for image tokenization at multiple compression rates without using convolutions, adversarial losses, spatially-aligned two-dimensional latent codes, or distilling from other tokenizers. Our key insight is that FlowMo training should be broken into a mode-matching pre-training stage and a mode-seeking post-training stage. In addition, we conduct extensive analyses and explore the training of generative models atop the FlowMo tokenizer. Our code and models will be available at http://kylesargent.github.io/flowmo .</p></details> | 18 pages, 13 figures |
