| **[Point Prompting: Counterfactual Tracking with Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11715v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project link: https://point-prompting.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Q-Router: Agentic Video Quality Assessment with Expert Model Routing and Artifact Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08789v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content (AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video, highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems. Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts, showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SANA-Video: Efficient Video Generation with Block Linear Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24695v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration. SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[TalkCuts: A Large-Scale Dataset for Multi-Shot Human Speech Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07249v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers 164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director, orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://talkcuts.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[AdaViewPlanner: Adapting Video Diffusion Models for Viewpoint Planning in 4D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10670v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First, we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[VORTA: Efficient Video Diffusion via Routing Sparse Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18809v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion transformers have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality video generation, but remain computationally expensive due to the quadratic complexity of attention over high-dimensional video sequences. Recent acceleration methods enhance the efficiency by exploiting the local sparsity of attention scores; yet they often struggle with accelerating the long-range computation. To address this problem, we propose VORTA, an acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse attention variants. VORTA achieves an end-to-end speedup $1.76\times$ without loss of quality on VBench. Furthermore, it can seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as model caching and step distillation, reaching up to speedup $14.41\times$ with negligible performance degradation. VORTA demonstrates its efficiency and enhances the practicality of video diffusion transformers in real-world settings. Codes and weights are available at https://github.com/wenhao728/VORTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

| **[A Synthetic Dataset for Manometry Recognition in Robotic Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17468v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition costs in training robust object detection models for complex industrial environments, such as offshore oil platforms. Data collection in these hazardous settings often limits the development of autonomous inspection systems. To mitigate this issue, we propose a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that integrates procedural rendering and AI-driven video generation. The approach uses BlenderProc to produce photorealistic images with domain randomization and NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2 to generate physically consistent video sequences with temporal variation. A YOLO-based detector trained on a composite dataset, combining real and synthetic data, outperformed models trained solely on real images. A 1:1 ratio between real and synthetic samples achieved the highest accuracy. The results demonstrate that synthetic data generation is a viable, cost-effective, and safe strategy for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiCOIN: Multi-Modal COntrollable Video INbetweening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08561v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex, or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we introduce MultiCOIN, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process, resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally, we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic, customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://multicoinx.github.io/multicoin/</p></details> |
| **[Stable Video Infinity: Infinite-Length Video Generation with Error Recycling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting (e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions (e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks, including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying its versatility and state-of-the-art role.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://stable-video-infinity.github.io/homepage/</p></details> |
| **[DenseDPO: Fine-Grained Temporal Preference Optimization for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03517v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been applied as a post-training technique for text-to-video diffusion models. To obtain training data, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated from independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained comparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion clips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce DenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three contributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted copies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar motion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing the motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label preferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and more precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO greatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text alignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that DenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences similar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO trained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight.

| **[The Role of Video Generation in Enhancing Data-Limited Action Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19495v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video action understanding tasks in real-world scenarios always suffer data limitations. In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot action recognition.</p></details> | IJCAI2025 |
| **[Generate Any Scene: Scene Graph Driven Data Synthesis for Visual Generation Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08221v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-vision generation excel in visual fidelity but struggle with compositional generalization and semantic alignment. Existing datasets are noisy and weakly compositional, limiting models' understanding of complex scenes, while scalable solutions for dense, high-quality annotations remain a challenge. We introduce Generate Any Scene, a data engine that systematically enumerates scene graphs representing the combinatorial array of possible visual scenes. Generate Any Scene dynamically constructs scene graphs of varying complexity from a structured taxonomy of objects, attributes, and relations. Given a sampled scene graph, Generate Any Scene translates it into a caption for text-to-image or text-to-video generation; it also translates it into a set of visual question answers that allow automatic evaluation and reward modeling of semantic alignment. Using Generate Any Scene, we first design a self-improving framework where models iteratively enhance their performance using generated data. Stable Diffusion v1.5 achieves an average 4% improvement over baselines and surpassing fine-tuning on CC3M. Second, we also design a distillation algorithm to transfer specific strengths from proprietary models to their open-source counterparts. Using fewer than 800 synthetic captions, we fine-tune Stable Diffusion v1.5 and achieve a 10% increase in TIFA score on compositional and hard concept generation. Third, we create a reward model to align model generation with semantic accuracy at a low cost. Using GRPO algorithm, we fine-tune SimpleAR-0.5B-SFT and surpass CLIP-based methods by +5% on DPG-Bench. Finally, we apply these ideas to the downstream task of content moderation where we train models to identify challenging cases by learning from synthetic data.</p></details> |  |
| **[SkipSR: Faster Super Resolution with Token Skipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08799v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[NovaFlow: Zero-Shot Manipulation via Actionable Flow from Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08568v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms. We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without demonstrations or embodiment-specific training.

| **[VideoCanvas: Unified Video Completion from Arbitrary Spatiotemporal Patches via In-Context Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08555v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision, however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models: the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC) paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control: spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms, establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://onevfall.github.io/project_page/videocanvas</p></details> |
| **[X2Video: Adapting Diffusion Models for Multimodal Controllable Neural Video Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08530v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness, metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry, and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention, which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154 rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions. Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

| **[FlexTraj: Image-to-Video Generation with Flexible Point Trajectory Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08527v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues, enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning, drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible action control and mesh animations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bestzzhang.github.io/FlexTraj</p></details> |
| **[Paper2Video: Automatic Video Generation from Scientific Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05096v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10 minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To address these challenges, we introduce Paper2Video, the first benchmark of 101 research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding, subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward automated and ready-to-use academic video generation.

| **[UniVideo: Unified Understanding, Generation, and Editing for Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08377v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we will release our model and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website https://congwei1230.github.io/UniVideo/</p></details> |
| **[LinVideo: A Post-Training Framework towards O(n) Attention in Efficient Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08318v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released upon acceptance</p></details> |
| **[UniMMVSR: A Unified Multi-Modal Framework for Cascaded Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08143v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with existing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Motion-Controllable Autoregressive Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08131v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control, then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B parameters.

| **[Coefficients-Preserving Sampling for Reinforcement Learning with Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05952v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models, specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method, Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS</p></details> | work in progress |

With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

This task faces persistent challenges, including identity inconsistency, entanglement among multiple reference subjects, and copy-paste artifacts. To address these issues, we introduce MAGREF, a unified and effective framework for any-reference video generation. Our approach incorporates masked guidance and a subject disentanglement mechanism, enabling flexible synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images and textual prompts. Specifically, masked guidance employs a region-aware masking mechanism combined with pixel-wise channel concatenation to preserve appearance features of multiple subjects along the channel dimension. This design preserves identity consistency and maintains the capabilities of the pre-trained backbone, without requiring any architectural changes. To mitigate subject confusion, we introduce a subject disentanglement mechanism which injects the semantic values of each subject derived from the text condition into its corresponding visual region. Additionally, we establish a four-stage data pipeline to construct diverse training pairs, effectively alleviating copy-paste artifacts. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate that MAGREF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for scalable, controllable, and high-fidelity any-reference video synthesis.

In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work, we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation on the fly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ttom-t2v.github.io/</p></details> |

To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to assist in long-sequence video storytelling by efficiently translating ideas into visual narratives. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief idea description, MAViS enables users to rapidly explore diverse visual storytelling and creative directions for sequential video generation by efficiently producing high-quality, complete long-sequence videos. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video Generation Agent</p></details> |

We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to prior works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://video-synthesis-variational.github.io/</p></details> |

Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging. Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement: specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading performance under these constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages (including references), 4 figures.

While humans can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of 300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together, TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation, however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with 45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases: occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements. Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic camera motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views. Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first 4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views. WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation, which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the anchor-wrist view gap.</p></details> |  |

This raises a key question: How do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers. Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation. We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations validate our design choices.

Nevertheless, current methods primarily concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel view synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 conference track</p></details> |

One key challenge in long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1) enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15% to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track different individuals in the captions of long videos.</p></details> |  |

Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework for video modeling in continuous space.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, video generation models are now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments. Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First, while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains, facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.

This often leads to unrealistic or physically implausible movements with inadequate structural coherence. To conquer these challenges, we propose MoSA, which decouples the process of human video generation into two components, i.e., structure generation and appearance generation. MoSA first employs a 3D structure transformer to generate a human motion sequence from the text prompt. The remaining video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of this structural sequence. We achieve fine-grained control over the sparse human structures by introducing Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules with a dense tracking constraint during training. The modeling of human-environment interactions is improved through the proposed contact constraint. Those two components work comprehensively to ensure the structural and appearance fidelity across the generated videos. This paper also contributes a large-scale human video dataset, which features more complex and diverse motions than existing human video datasets. We conduct comprehensive comparisons between MoSA and a variety of approaches, including general video generation models, human video generation models, and human animation models. Experiments demonstrate that MoSA substantially outperforms existing approaches across the majority of evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://hywang2002.github.io/MoSA</p></details> |

Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some measure of the content's goodness. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward at inference time. We then point out that improving perceptual video quality with respect to alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with the evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline: we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into enabling the lookahead estimator and increasing the search budget, rather than expanding the denoising steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2025.

A Multimodal Automated Video Editing Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05661v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut. Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments. We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art in multimodal automated video editing.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer rich physical context from the text prompt. To incorporate this context into the video diffusion model, we use a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to verify intermediate latent variables against the inferred physical rules, guiding the gradient updates of model accordingly. Textual output of LLM is transformed into continuous signals. We then formulate a set of training objectives that jointly ensure physical accuracy and semantic alignment with the input text. Additionally, failure facts of physical phenomena are corrected via attention injection. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

The redundancy of latents in diffusion model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper, we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage, while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range.

Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain, a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically, VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex, multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://eyeline-labs.github.io/VChain Code: https://github.com/Eyeline-Labs/VChain</p></details> |
| **[Character Mixing for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05093v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where characters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve each character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and because mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation (CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative storytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page: https://tingtingliao.github.io/mimix/.</p></details> |  |

From its inception, the field has advanced from adversarial models to diffusion-based models, yielding higher-fidelity, temporally consistent outputs. Yet challenges persist, such as alignment, long-range coherence, and computational efficiency. Addressing this evolving landscape, we present a comprehensive survey of text-to-video generative models, tracing their development from early GANs and VAEs to hybrid Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) architectures, detailing how these models work, what limitations they addressed in their predecessors, and why shifts toward new architectural paradigms were necessary to overcome challenges in quality, coherence, and control. We provide a systematic account of the datasets, which the surveyed text-to-video models were trained and evaluated on, and, to support reproducibility and assess the accessibility of training such models, we detail their training configurations, including their hardware specifications, GPU counts, batch sizes, learning rates, optimizers, epochs, and other key hyperparameters. Further, we outline the evaluation metrics commonly used for evaluating such models and present their performance across standard benchmarks, while also discussing the limitations of these metrics and the emerging shift toward more holistic, perception-aligned evaluation strategies. Finally, drawing from our analysis, we outline the current open challenges and propose a few promising future directions, laying out a perspective for future researchers to explore and build upon in advancing T2V research and applications.</p></details> |  |

Yet, not all mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i) whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like MaskGIT.</p></details> |  |
| **[STIV: Scalable Text and Image Conditioned Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07730v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of video generation has made remarkable advancements, yet there remains a pressing need for a clear, systematic recipe that can guide the development of robust and scalable models. In this work, we present a comprehensive study that systematically explores the interplay of model architectures, training recipes, and data curation strategies, culminating in a simple and scalable text-image-conditioned video generation method, named STIV. Our framework integrates image condition into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) through frame replacement, while incorporating text conditioning via a joint image-text conditional classifier-free guidance. This design enables STIV to perform both text-to-video (T2V) and text-image-to-video (TI2V) tasks simultaneously. Additionally, STIV can be easily extended to various applications, such as video prediction, frame interpolation, multi-view generation, and long video generation, etc. With comprehensive ablation studies on T2I, T2V, and TI2V, STIV demonstrate strong performance, despite its simple design. An 8.7B model with 512 resolution achieves 83.1 on VBench T2V, surpassing both leading open and closed-source models like CogVideoX-5B, Pika, Kling, and Gen-3. The same-sized model also achieves a state-of-the-art result of 90.1 on VBench I2V task at 512 resolution. By providing a transparent and extensible recipe for building cutting-edge video generation models, we aim to empower future research and accelerate progress toward more versatile and reliable video generation solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChronoEdit: Towards Temporal Reasoning for Image Editing and World Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04290v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit will be released on the project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/chronoedit</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/chronoedit</p></details> |

However, the extent to which these AI-generated videos simulate the 3D visual world remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Learned 3D Evaluation (L3DE), an objective, quantifiable, and interpretable method for assessing AI-generated videos' ability to simulate the real world in terms of 3D visual qualities and consistencies, without requiring manually labeled defects or quality annotations. Instead of relying on 3D reconstruction, which is prone to failure with in-the-wild videos, L3DE employs a 3D convolutional network, trained on monocular 3D cues of motion, depth, and appearance, to distinguish real from synthetic videos. Confidence scores from L3DE quantify the gap between real and synthetic videos in terms of 3D visual coherence, while a gradient-based visualization pinpoints unrealistic regions, improving interpretability. We validate L3DE through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong alignment with 3D reconstruction quality and human judgments. Our evaluations on leading generative models (e.g., Kling, Sora, and MiniMax) reveal persistent simulation gaps and subtle inconsistencies. Beyond generative video assessment, L3DE extends to broader applications: benchmarking video generation models, serving as a deepfake detector, and enhancing video synthesis by inpainting flagged inconsistencies.

| **[Mixture of Contexts for Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21058v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://primecai.github.io/moc/</p></details> |
| **[DynamicScaler: Seamless and Scalable Video Generation for Panoramic Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11100v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for immersive AR/VR applications and spatial intelligence has heightened the need to generate high-quality scene-level and 360${\deg}$ panoramic video. However, most video diffusion models are constrained by limited resolution and aspect ratio, which restricts their applicability to scene-level dynamic content synthesis. In this work, we propose $\textbf{DynamicScaler}$, addressing these challenges by enabling spatially scalable and panoramic dynamic scene synthesis that preserves coherence across panoramic scenes of arbitrary size. Specifically, we introduce a Offset Shifting Denoiser, facilitating efficient, synchronous, and coherent denoising panoramic dynamic scenes via a diffusion model with fixed resolution through a seamless rotating Window, which ensures seamless boundary transitions and consistency across the entire panoramic space, accommodating varying resolutions and aspect ratios. Additionally, we employ a Global Motion Guidance mechanism to ensure both local detail fidelity and global motion continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior content and motion quality in panoramic scene-level video generation, offering a training-free, efficient, and scalable solution for immersive dynamic scene creation with constant VRAM consumption regardless of the output video resolution.

| **[Controllable Video Generation with Provable Disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02690v3)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable video generation remains a significant challenge, despite recent advances in generating high-quality and consistent videos. Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Despite the rapid progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation. It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs, mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions, conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, Project Page:https://hyelinnam.github.io/Cameo/</p></details> |

To meet the computational demands of AI tasks, current mobile SoCs are equipped with diverse AI accelerators, including GPUs and Neural Processing Units (NPUs). However, there has not been a comprehensive characterization of these heterogeneous processors, and existing designs typically only leverage a single AI accelerator for LLM inference, leading to suboptimal use of computational resources and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we first summarize key performance characteristics of heterogeneous processors, SoC memory bandwidth, etc. Drawing on these observations, we propose different heterogeneous parallel mechanisms to fully exploit both GPU and NPU computational power and memory bandwidth. We further design a fast synchronization mechanism between heterogeneous processors that leverages the unified memory architecture. By employing these techniques, we present HeteroInfer, the fastest LLM inference engine in mobile devices which supports GPU-NPU heterogeneous execution. Evaluation shows that HeteroInfer delivers a 1.34x to 6.02x end-to-end speedup over state-of-the-art GPU-only and NPU-only LLM engines, while maintaining negligible interference with other applications.</p></details> |  |

They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. (3) RACCooN also plans to imagine new objects in a given video, so users simply prompt the model to receive a detailed video editing plan for complex video editing. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 main; The first two authors contribute equally.

However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://reagan1311.github.io/mask2iv</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we make two contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing the practical usability of autoregressive video models.</p></details> |  |

Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer, which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust ``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information, achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions, offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX.

However, these methods fall short when scenes contain poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that demonstrates the transformation process from less favorable to aesthetically enhanced perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users to enhance their composition skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model. Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss, our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://beijia11.github.io/IASA</p></details> |

Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities, spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate, producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns. To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.</p></details> |  |

More specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid, and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiModal Action Conditioned Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02287v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control. General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our work.</p></details> |  |

Beyond their creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however, current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore, KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on transformer architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos. Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to 20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency.

| **[TempoControl: Temporal Attention Guidance for Text-to-Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02226v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications, including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as action and audio-aligned generation.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Multi-marginal temporal Schrödinger Bridge Matching for video generation from unpaired data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01894v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Existing solutions either rely on extensive manual scripting/editing or prioritize single-shot fidelity over cross-scene continuity, limiting their practicality for movie-like content. We introduce VideoGen-of-Thought (VGoT), a step-by-step framework that automates multi-shot video synthesis from a single sentence by systematically addressing three core challenges: (1) Narrative fragmentation: Existing methods lack structured storytelling. We propose dynamic storyline modeling, which turns the user prompt into concise shot drafts and then expands them into detailed specifications across five domains (character dynamics, background continuity, relationship evolution, camera movements, and HDR lighting) with self-validation to ensure logical progress. (2) Visual inconsistency: previous approaches struggle to maintain consistent appearance across shots. Our identity-aware cross-shot propagation builds identity-preserving portrait (IPP) tokens that keep character identity while allowing controlled trait changes (expressions, aging) required by the story. (3) Transition artifacts: Abrupt shot changes disrupt immersion. Our adjacent latent transition mechanisms implement boundary-aware reset strategies that process adjacent shots' features at transition points, enabling seamless visual flow while preserving narrative continuity. Combined in a training-free pipeline, VGoT surpasses strong baselines by 20.4\% in within-shot face consistency and 17.4\% in style consistency, while requiring 10x fewer manual adjustments. VGoT bridges the gap between raw visual synthesis and director-level storytelling for automated multi-shot video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/DuNGEOnmassster/VideoGen-of-Thought.git; Webpage: https://cheliosoops.github.io/VGoT/</p></details> |
| **[AniMaker: Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10540v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.</p></details> |  |

While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Autoregressive Adversarial Post-Training for Real-Time Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09350v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models' understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects, thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Inspired by this mental process, we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration. Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/JiahaoPlus/EvoWorld</p></details> |

Intuitively, such requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g., code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency; and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced, discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos. Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials.

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrices $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrices $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK^\top$. Third, we propose a two-level accumulation strategy for $\widetilde PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 4.5x on RTX4090, respectively. Moreover, SageAttention2 matches the speed of FlashAttention3(fp8) on the Hopper GPUs, while delivering much higher accuracy.

As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of $O(N^2)$, compared to $O(N)$ for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3.

| **[Arbitrary Generative Video Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00578v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity.

While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension -- whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e., spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s. real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest). By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://deeptracereward.github.io/</p></details> |

However, the power of AE has long been underexplored in terms of network design, compression ratio, and training strategy. In this work, we systematically examine the architecture design choices and optimize the computation distribution to obtain a series of efficient and high-compression video AEs that can decode in real time even on mobile devices. We also propose an omni-training objective to unify the design of plain Autoencoder and image-conditioned I2V VAE, achieving multifunctionality in a single VAE network but with enhanced quality. In addition, we propose a novel latent consistency loss that provides stable improvements in reconstruction quality. Latent consistency loss outperforms prior auxiliary losses including LPIPS, GAN and DWT in terms of both quality improvements and simplicity. H3AE achieves ultra-high compression ratios and real-time decoding speed on GPU and mobile, and outperforms prior arts in terms of reconstruction metrics by a large margin. We finally validate our AE by training a DiT on its latent space and demonstrate fast, high-quality text-to-video generation capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, such models require a significant number of function evaluations (NFEs) during sampling, leading to costly inference. Consequently, quality-preserving fast sampling methods that require fewer NFEs have been an active area of research. However, prior training-free sampling methods fail to simultaneously address two key challenges: the stiffness of the ODE (i.e., the non-straightness of the velocity field) and dependence on the semi-linear structure of the DM ODE (which limits their direct applicability to flow-matching models). In this work, we introduce the Stabilized Taylor Orthogonal Runge--Kutta (STORK) method, addressing both design concerns. We demonstrate that STORK consistently improves the quality of diffusion and flow-matching sampling for image and video generation.

However, existing video generation models still fall short in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming existing open-source and commercial models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Ovi, a unified paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules, Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate, context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips.

However, existing models and benchmarks fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera. Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+ models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture; (iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of realistic motion dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B supports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS settings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

| **[PatchVSR: Breaking Video Diffusion Resolution Limits with Patch-wise Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26025v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR. This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512 resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 13 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |

While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact, motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied planning.

However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting their practical usability. In this paper, we propose Wan-Alpha, a new framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as hair strands. The released model is available on our website: https://donghaotian123.github.io/Wan-Alpha/.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to significantly accelerate video generation and enable practical deployment on mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platforms while preserving critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to achieve approximately 15 frames per second (FPS) generation speed on an iPhone 16 Pro Max, demonstrating the feasibility of efficient, high-quality video generation on mobile devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

We propose a world-model-based policy evaluation environment (WorldGym), an autoregressive, action-conditioned video generation model which serves as a proxy to real world environments. Policies are evaluated via Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model, with a vision-language model providing rewards. We evaluate a set of VLA-based real-robot policies in the world model using only initial frames from real robots, and show that policy success rates within the world model highly correlate with real-world success rates. Moreoever, we show that WorldGym is able to preserve relative policy rankings across different policy versions, sizes, and training checkpoints. Due to requiring only a single start frame as input, the world model further enables efficient evaluation of robot policies' generalization ability on novel tasks and environments. We find that modern VLA-based robot policies still struggle to distinguish object shapes and can become distracted by adversarial facades of objects. While generating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging, WorldGym faithfully emulates robot motions and offers a practical starting point for safe and reproducible policy evaluation before deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-model-eval.github.io</p></details> |

Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains, but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity. Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88 PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$} reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end inference.

Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality.

We show that this connection enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project link: https://point-prompting.github.io</p></details> |
| **[On Convolutions, Intrinsic Dimension, and Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20705v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models, and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support. For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers, adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions. Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025 (expert certification)</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Transformers with Representation Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11690v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty, propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; Project Page: https://rae-dit.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization for Memory-efficient RL of Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11683v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance. Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-DFL: Decision-focused Diffusion Models for Stochastic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11590v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1) complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation), and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space, our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without relying on predefined instrument categories.

Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations} (MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail \textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).</p></details> |  |

To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Error Propagation Mechanisms and Compensation Strategies for Quantized Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12094v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have transformed image synthesis by establishing unprecedented quality and creativity benchmarks. Nevertheless, their large-scale deployment faces challenges due to computationally intensive iterative denoising processes. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an effective pathway for accelerating sampling, the iterative nature of diffusion models causes stepwise quantization errors to accumulate progressively during generation, inevitably compromising output fidelity. To address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that mathematically formulates error propagation in Diffusion Models (DMs), deriving per-step quantization error propagation equations and establishing the first closed-form solution for cumulative error. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate that our compensation strategy effectively mitigates error propagation, significantly enhancing existing PTQ methods. Specifically, it achieves a 1.2 PSNR improvement over SVDQuant on SDXL W4A4, while incurring only an additional $<$ 0.5\% time overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs with Masked Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11462v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the significant benefits of our unified approach.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[ID-Booth: Identity-consistent Face Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07392v6)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. The source code for the ID-Booth framework is publicly available at https://github.com/dariant/ID-Booth.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) 2025, 14 pages</p></details> |

It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation, helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that disentangles a time series into content and style representations via convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.</p></details> |  |

We present Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results. (1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2) Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and 7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond knowledge-retrieval-centric designs.

Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers a $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared to the AR model (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with the latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still delivers a $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unified and Lossless Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality. On GEOM-Drugs, it reduces FCD by 72.6\% over the previous best result, while achieving over 70\% relative average improvements in geometric fidelity. Our code is released at https://github.com/lyc0930/UAE-3D/.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Wang and Zhu (2023) showed that for the Wasserstein metric $\mathcal{W}_2$ and for $d\geq 5$, the convergence rate of $T^{-1/(d-2)}$ is attained by the occupation measure of the path $(X_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$ when $(X_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$ is a Langevin diffusion. We extend their result in several directions. First, we show that the rate of convergence holds for a large class of diffusion paths, whose generators are uniformly elliptic. Second, the regularity of the density $p$ of the stationary measure $\mu$ with respect to the volume measure of $\mathcal{M}$ can be leveraged to obtain faster estimators: when $p$ belongs to a Sobolev space of order $\ell\geq 2$, smoothing the occupation measure by convolution with a kernel yields an estimator whose rate of convergence is of order $T^{-(\ell+1)/(2\ell+d-2)}$. We further show that this rate is the minimax rate of estimation for this problem.</p></details> |  |

CSI prediction, which forecasts future CSI from historical observations, offers a promising solution. Recent deep learning approaches, including recurrent neural networks and Transformers, have achieved notable success but typically learn deterministic mappings, limiting their ability to capture the stochastic and multimodal nature of wireless channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for CSI prediction based on diffusion models, offering a flexible design that supports integration of diverse prediction schemes. We decompose the CSI prediction task into two components: a temporal encoder, which extracts channel dynamics, and a diffusion-based generator, which produces future CSI samples. We investigate two inference schemes-autoregressive and sequence-to-sequence- and explore multiple diffusion backbones, including U-Net and Transformer-based architectures. Furthermore, we examine a diffusion-based approach without an explicit temporal encoder and utilize the DDIM scheduling to reduce model complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our diffusion-based models significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |

Previous arts failed to address both of them, always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band, while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row. Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile, serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion models.

Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and model are available at https://github.com/M-E-AGI-Lab/Muddit</p></details> |

SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Demystifying Numerosity in Diffusion Models -- Limitations and Remedies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11117v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6 featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization across settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoDefend: Cross-Modal Collaborative Defense via Diffusion Purification and Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11096v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex multimodal tasks. In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies. Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of MLLMs in real world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete-Time Diffusion-Like Models for Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18470v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising, which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions. Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants. These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises. The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.</p></details> |  |

However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism, `Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in generation quality across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 17 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |

Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream, mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding (HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment is often limited by significant inference latency, primarily due to the inherently sequential nature of the denoising process. While existing parallelization strategies attempt to accelerate inference by distributing computation across multiple devices, they typically incur high communication overhead, hindering deployment on commercial hardware. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{ParaStep}, a novel parallelization method based on a reuse-then-predict mechanism that parallelizes diffusion inference by exploiting similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike prior approaches that rely on layer-wise or stage-wise communication, ParaStep employs lightweight, step-wise communication, substantially reducing overhead. ParaStep achieves end-to-end speedups of up to \textbf{3.88}$\times$ on SVD, \textbf{2.43}$\times$ on CogVideoX-2b, and \textbf{6.56}$\times$ on AudioLDM2-large, while maintaining generation quality. These results highlight ParaStep as a scalable and communication-efficient solution for accelerating diffusion inference, particularly in bandwidth-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.

While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot, inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion attributes according to target Laban tags.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free). Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors. Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems, including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |

As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. However, the widespread adoption and advancing capabilities of generative image editing tools have amplified malicious tampering risks, while simultaneously posing new challenges to passive tampering detection and watermark robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results demonstrate that TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tampering robustness and localization capability even under distortion, while preserving lossless generation quality and maintaining a watermark capacity of 256 bits.

However, flexible and localized style editing for scene text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and text preservation.</p></details> |  |

However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500, 18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.</p></details> |  |

The proposed coarsening approaches begin by constructing a partitioning of the computational domain into a set of balanced local subdomains, resulting in a standard type of domain decomposition. Given this initial decomposition, general coarsening techniques based on spectral clustering are applied within each subgraph in order to accurately identify the key microscopic features of a given system. The spectral clustering algorithm is based on local generalized eigen-decompositions applied to the signed graph Laplacian. The resulting coarse-fine splittings are combined with two variants of energy-minimizing strategies for constructing coarse bases for diffusion problems. The first is an unconstrained minimization formulation in which local harmonic extensions are applied column-wise to construct multi-vector preserving interpolation in each region, whereas the second approach is a variant of the constrained energy minimization formulations derived in the context of non-local multi-continua upscaling techniques. We apply the resulting upscaling algorithms to a variety of tests coming from the graph Laplacian, including diffusion in the perforated domain, channelized media, highly anisotropic settings, and discrete pore network models to demonstrate the potential and robustness of the proposed coarsening approaches. We show numerically and theoretically that the proposed approaches lead to accurate coarse-scale models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while slightly improving performance over the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://soroushmehraban.github.io/FastHMR/</p></details> |

Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models, essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint. In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance of discrete-state diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Layered Diffusion Brushes (LDB), a novel training-free framework that enables interactive, layer-based editing using standard diffusion models. LDB defines each "layer" as a self-contained set of parameters guiding the generative process, enabling independent, non-destructive, and fine-grained prompt-guided edits, even in overlapping regions. LDB leverages a unique intermediate latent caching approach to reduce each edit to only a few denoising steps, achieving 140~ms per edit on consumer GPUs. An editor implementing LDB, incorporating familiar layer concepts, was evaluated via user study and quantitative metrics. Results demonstrate LDB's superior speed alongside comparable or improved image quality, background preservation, and edit fidelity relative to state-of-the-art methods across various sequential image manipulation tasks. The findings highlight LDB's ability to significantly enhance creative workflows by providing an intuitive and efficient approach to diffusion-based image editing and its potential for expansion into related subdomains, such as video editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.00219</p></details> |
| **[Crisis-Aware Regime-Conditioned Diffusion with CVaR Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10807v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE) denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance. In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/AliAtiah/MARCD</p></details> |

First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA) mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted 2025 EMNLP (MainConference)</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Sampler Stochasticity in Training Diffusion Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10767v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local MAP Sampling for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07343v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on inverse scattering benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-Covering Trajectory Stitching for Diffusion Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00895v3)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by this, we explore the feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First, we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaDA 1.5: Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization for Large Language Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19223v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), such as LLaDA, present a promising paradigm for language modeling, there has been relatively little effort in aligning these models with human preferences via reinforcement learning. The challenge primarily arises from the high variance in Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)-based likelihood estimates required for preference optimization. To address this issue, we propose Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization (VRPO), a framework that formally analyzes the variance of ELBO estimators and derives bounds on both the bias and variance of preference optimization gradients. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce unbiased variance reduction strategies, including optimal Monte Carlo budget allocation and antithetic sampling, that significantly improve the performance of MDM alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VRPO by applying it to LLaDA, and the resulting model, LLaDA 1.5, outperforms its SFT-only predecessor consistently and significantly across mathematical (GSM8K +4.7), code (HumanEval +3.0, MBPP +1.8), and alignment benchmarks (IFEval +4.0, Arena-Hard +4.3). Furthermore, LLaDA 1.5 demonstrates a highly competitive mathematical performance compared to strong language MDMs and ARMs. Project page: https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-1.5-Demo/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Face Security Vision Foundation Model for Deepfake, Diffusion, and Spoofing Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10663v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable facial representations to boost generalization across various face security tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically, we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training, vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent efficiency-performance trade-off.

| **[HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided Versatile Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03122v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision. However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProteinAE: Protein Diffusion Autoencoders for Structure Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10634v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling. Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold, rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives, all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective, substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly outperforms prior latent-based methods.

| **[Injecting Frame-Event Complementary Fusion into Diffusion for Optical Flow in Challenging Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10577v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.</p></details> |  |

Recent acceleration methods enhance the efficiency by exploiting the local sparsity of attention scores; yet they often struggle with accelerating the long-range computation. To address this problem, we propose VORTA, an acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse attention variants. VORTA achieves an end-to-end speedup $1.76\times$ without loss of quality on VBench. Furthermore, it can seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as model caching and step distillation, reaching up to speedup $14.41\times$ with negligible performance degradation.

We present a case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights, we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that, in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale context via efficient post-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHD: Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion for Long-Horizon Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07261v3)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based planners have shown strong performance in short-horizon tasks but often fail in complex, long-horizon settings. We trace the failure to loose coupling between high-level (HL) sub-goal selection and low-level (LL) trajectory generation, which leads to incoherent plans and degraded performance. We propose Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion (CHD), a framework that models HL sub-goals and LL trajectories jointly within a unified diffusion process. A shared classifier passes LL feedback upstream so that sub-goals self-correct while sampling proceeds. This tight HL-LL coupling improves trajectory coherence and enables scalable long-horizon diffusion planning. Experiments across maze navigation, tabletop manipulation, and household environments show that CHD consistently outperforms both flat and hierarchical diffusion baselines.

| **[MonoSE(3)-Diffusion: A Monocular SE(3) Diffusion Framework for Robust Camera-to-Robot Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10434v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses, thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks (DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Graph Generation with Diffusion Models via Inference-Time Tree Search Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10402v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation. TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition, reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods plateau early under limited resources.</p></details> |  |

The numerical stability and, considering the Stokes-type viscosity multipolar of the 2nd-grade, also convergence towards weak solutions are proved in three-dimensional situations, exploiting the convexity of the kinetic energy when written in terms of linear momentum. No (poly)convexity of the stored energy is required and some enhancements (specifically towards damage and diffusion models) are briefly outlined, too.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments. DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

These methods easily collapse when changing the prompt view direction and mainly handle object-centric cases. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage 3D diffusion model, DiffusionGS, for object generation and scene reconstruction from a single view. DiffusionGS directly outputs 3D Gaussian point clouds at each timestep to enforce view consistency and allow the model to generate robustly given prompt views of any directions, beyond object-centric inputs. Plus, to improve the capability and generality of DiffusionGS, we scale up 3D training data by developing a scene-object mixed training strategy. Experiments show that DiffusionGS yields improvements of 2.20 dB/23.25 and 1.34 dB/19.16 in PSNR/FID for objects and scenes than the state-of-the-art methods, without depth estimator.

| **[CURE: Concept Unlearning via Orthogonal Representation Editing in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12677v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Text-to-Image models continue to evolve, so does the risk of generating unsafe, copyrighted, or privacy-violating content. Existing safety interventions - ranging from training data curation and model fine-tuning to inference-time filtering and guidance - often suffer from incomplete concept removal, susceptibility to jail-breaking, computational inefficiency, or collateral damage to unrelated capabilities. In this paper, we introduce CURE, a training-free concept unlearning framework that operates directly in the weight space of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling fast, interpretable, and highly specific suppression of undesired concepts. At the core of our method is the Spectral Eraser, a closed-form, orthogonal projection module that identifies discriminative subspaces using Singular Value Decomposition over token embeddings associated with the concepts to forget and retain. Intuitively, the Spectral Eraser identifies and isolates features unique to the undesired concept while preserving safe attributes. This operator is then applied in a single step update to yield an edited model in which the target concept is effectively unlearned - without retraining, supervision, or iterative optimization. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving unrelated concepts, we further introduce an Expansion Mechanism for spectral regularization which selectively modulates singular vectors based on their relative significance to control the strength of forgetting. All the processes above are in closed-form, guaranteeing extremely efficient erasure in only $2$ seconds. Benchmarking against prior approaches, CURE achieves a more efficient and thorough removal for targeted artistic styles, objects, identities, or explicit content, with minor damage to original generation ability and demonstrates enhanced robustness against red-teaming.</p></details> |  |
| **[OSCAR: One-Step Diffusion Codec Across Multiple Bit-rates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16091v5)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents, where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models are available at https://github.com/jp-guo/OSCAR.</p></details> |  |

One drawback with existing models is that they lack structural cohesion, particularly on harmonic-melodic structure. Furthermore, such existing models are largely "black-box" in nature and are not musically interpretable. This paper addresses these limitations via a novel generative music framework that incorporates concepts of Schenkerian analysis (SchA) in concert with a diffusion modeling framework. This framework, which we call ProGress (Prolongation-enhanced DiGress), adapts state-of-the-art deep models for discrete diffusion (in particular, the DiGress model of Vignac et al., 2023) for interpretable and structured music generation. Concretely, our contributions include 1) novel adaptations of the DiGress model for music generation, 2) a novel SchA-inspired phrase fusion methodology, and 3) a framework allowing users to control various aspects of the generation process to create coherent musical compositions. Results from human experiments suggest superior performance to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This has also raised security concerns on social media, as malicious users can create and disseminate harmful content. Existing approaches typically involve training specific components or entire generative models to embed a watermark in generated images for traceability and responsibility. However, in the fast-evolving era of AI-generated content (AIGC), the rapid iteration and modification of LDMs makes retraining with watermark models costly. To address the problem, we propose MarkPlugger, a generalizable plug-and-play watermark framework without LDM retraining. In particular, to reduce the disturbance of the watermark on the semantics of the generated image, we try to identify a watermark representation that is approaching orthogonal to the semantic in latent space, and apply an additive fusion strategy for the watermark and the semantic. Without modifying any components of the LDMs, we embed diverse watermarks in latent space, adapting to the denoising process. Our experimental findings reveal that our method effectively harmonizes image quality and watermark recovery rate. We also have validated that our method is generalized to multiple official versions and modified variants of LDMs, even without retraining the watermark model. Furthermore, it performs robustly under various attacks of different intensities.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Multimedia 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer for Jointly Simulating User Mobility and Mobile Traffic Pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10158v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User mobility trajectory and mobile traffic data are essential for a wide spectrum of applications including urban planning, network optimization, and emergency management. However, large-scale and fine-grained mobility data remains difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and collection costs, making it essential to simulate realistic mobility and traffic patterns. User trajectories and mobile traffic are fundamentally coupled, reflecting both physical mobility and cyber behavior in urban environments. Despite this strong interdependence, existing studies often model them separately, limiting the ability to capture cross-modal dynamics. Therefore, a unified framework is crucial. In this paper, we propose MSTDiff, a Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer for joint simulation of mobile traffic and user trajectories. First, MSTDiff applies discrete wavelet transforms for multi-resolution traffic decomposition. Second, it uses a hybrid denoising network to process continuous traffic volumes and discrete location sequences. A transition mechanism based on urban knowledge graph embedding similarity is designed to guide semantically informed trajectory generation. Finally, a multi-scale Transformer with cross-attention captures dependencies between trajectories and traffic. Experiments show that MSTDiff surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in traffic and trajectory generation tasks, reducing Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) across key statistical metrics by up to 17.38% for traffic generation, and by an average of 39.53% for trajectory generation.

| **[Robust Learning of Diffusion Models with Extremely Noisy Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10149v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project page https://robustdiffusionpolicy.github.io</p></details> |  |
| **[Waves of Imagination: Unconditional Spectrogram Generation using Diffusion Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10044v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for effective spectrum management and interference mitigation in shared bands, such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), requires robust radar detection algorithms to protect the military transmission from interference due to commercial wireless transmission. These algorithms, in turn, depend on large, diverse, and carefully labeled spectrogram datasets. However, collecting and annotating real-world radio frequency (RF) spectrogram data remains a significant challenge, as radar signals are rare, and their occurrences are infrequent. This challenge makes the creation of balanced datasets difficult, limiting the performance and generalizability of AI models in this domain. To address this critical issue, we propose a diffusion-based generative model for synthesizing realistic and diverse spectrograms of five distinct categories that integrate LTE, 5G, and radar signals within the CBRS band. We conduct a structural and statistical fidelity analysis of the generated spectrograms using widely accepted evaluation metrics Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), to quantify their divergence from the training data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pre-training on the generated spectrograms significantly improves training efficiency on a real-world radar detection task by enabling $51.5\%$ faster convergence.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness, achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K, and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denoising Diffusion as a New Framework for Underwater Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09934v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets, and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

| **[Closing the Data-Efficiency Gap Between Autoregressive and Masked Diffusion LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09885v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training. However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs, evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[TREAD: Token Routing for Efficient Architecture-agnostic Diffusion Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04765v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as the mainstream approach for visual generation. However, these models typically suffer from sample inefficiency and high training costs. Consequently, methods for efficient finetuning, inference and personalization were quickly adopted by the community. However, training these models in the first place remains very costly. While several recent approaches - including masking, distillation, and architectural modifications - have been proposed to improve training efficiency, each of these methods comes with a tradeoff: they achieve enhanced performance at the expense of increased computational cost or vice versa. In contrast, this work aims to improve training efficiency as well as generative performance at the same time through routes that act as a transport mechanism for randomly selected tokens from early layers to deeper layers of the model. Our method is not limited to the common transformer-based model - it can also be applied to state-space models and achieves this without architectural modifications or additional parameters. Finally, we show that TREAD reduces computational cost and simultaneously boosts model performance on the standard ImageNet-256 benchmark in class-conditional synthesis. Both of these benefits multiply to a convergence speedup of 14x at 400K training iterations compared to DiT and 37x compared to the best benchmark performance of DiT at 7M training iterations. Furthermore, we achieve a competitive FID of 2.09 in a guided and 3.93 in an unguided setting, which improves upon the DiT, without architectural changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Diffusion Policy with Classifier-Free Guidance for Temporal Robotic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09786v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal sequential tasks challenge humanoid robots, as existing Diffusion Policy (DP) and Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) methods often lack temporal context, resulting in local optima traps and excessive repetitive actions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Classifier-Free Guidance-Based Diffusion Policy (CFG-DP), a novel framework to enhance DP by integrating Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) with conditional and unconditional models. Specifically, CFG leverages timestep inputs to track task progression and ensure precise cycle termination. It dynamically adjusts action predictions based on task phase, using a guidance factor tuned to balance temporal coherence and action accuracy. Real-world experiments on a humanoid robot demonstrate high success rates and minimal repetitive actions. Furthermore, we assessed the model's ability to terminate actions and examined how different components and parameter adjustments affect its performance. This framework significantly enhances deterministic control and execution reliability for sequential robotic tasks.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is capable of combining temperature information from different molecular simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ProbRes, a Probabilistic Residual search framework based on jump-diffusion that efficiently navigates this space by balancing prior-guided exploration with likelihood-driven exploitation. Our approach integrates structured commonsense priors to construct a semantically coherent search space, adaptively refines predictions using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and employs a stochastic search mechanism to locate high-likelihood activity labels while minimizing exhaustive enumeration efficiently. We systematically evaluate ProbRes across multiple openness levels (L0-L3), demonstrating its adaptability to increasing search space complexity. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets (GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze+, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charades-Ego), we establish a clear taxonomy for open-world recognition, delineating the challenges and methodological advancements necessary for egocentric activity understanding. Our results highlight the importance of structured search strategies, paving the way for scalable and efficient open-world activity recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025. 17 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[On the Interpolation Effect of Score Smoothing in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19499v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in various domains with the ability to generate new data samples that do not exist in the training set. In this work, we study the hypothesis that such creativity arises from an interpolation effect caused by a smoothing of the empirical score function. Focusing on settings where the training set lies uniformly in a one-dimensional subspace, we show theoretically how regularized two-layer ReLU neural networks tend to learn approximately a smoothed version of the empirical score function, and further probe the interplay between score smoothing and the denoising dynamics with analytical solutions and numerical experiments. In particular, we demonstrate how a smoothed score function can lead to the generation of samples that interpolate the training data along their subspace while avoiding full memorization. Moreover, we present experimental evidence that learning score functions with neural networks indeed induces a score smoothing effect, including in simple nonlinear settings and without explicit regularization.</p></details> |  |
| **[TC-LoRA: Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA for Adaptive Diffusion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09561v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic, multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic, parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages; NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on SPACE in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI (SpaVLE)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Surface Reasoning: Unveiling the True Long Chain-of-Thought Capacity of Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09544v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection, reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements, diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.</p></details> | Preprint |

The classes of systems we study are quite general with a focus on convection-dominated and degenerate parabolic problems. Our a posteriori error bounds are valid for a family of discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretizations and various temporal discretizations that include explicit and implicit-explicit time-stepping schemes, popular tools for practical simulations of this class of problem. We prove that our estimators provide reliable upper bounds for the error of the numerical method and present numerical evidence showing that they achieve the same order of convergence as the error. Since one of our main interests is the convection dominant case, we also track the dependence of the estimator on the viscosity coefficient.</p></details> | 33 pages, 13 figures |

A Score-Based Riemannian Metric to Explore the Data Manifold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11128v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated their remarkable ability to capture complex image distributions, but the geometric properties of the learned data manifold remain poorly understood. We address this gap by introducing a score-based Riemannian metric that leverages the Stein score function from diffusion models to characterize the intrinsic geometry of the data manifold without requiring explicit parameterization. Our approach defines a metric tensor in the ambient space that stretches distances perpendicular to the manifold while preserving them along tangential directions, effectively creating a geometry where geodesics naturally follow the manifold's contours. We develop efficient algorithms for computing these geodesics and demonstrate their utility for both interpolation between data points and extrapolation beyond the observed data distribution. Through experiments on synthetic data with known geometry, Rotated MNIST, and complex natural images via Stable Diffusion, we show that our score-based geodesics capture meaningful transformations that respect the underlying data distribution. Our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches on perceptual metrics (LPIPS) and distribution-level metrics (FID, KID), producing smoother, more realistic image transitions. These results reveal the implicit geometric structure learned by diffusion models and provide a principled way to navigate the manifold of natural images through the lens of Riemannian geometry.</p></details> |  |

RGB and depth images are commonly used to capture both the semantic and geometric features of the environment. Developing methods to reliably interpret this data is critical for real-world applications, where noisy measurements are often unavoidable. In this work, we introduce a diffusion-based framework to address the RGB-D semantic segmentation problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that utilizing a Deformable Attention Transformer as the encoder to extract features from depth images effectively captures the characteristics of invalid regions in depth measurements. Our generative framework shows a greater capacity to model the underlying distribution of RGB-D images, achieving robust performance in challenging scenarios with significantly less training time compared to discriminative methods. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves State-of-the-Art performance on both the NYUv2 and SUN-RGBD datasets in general and especially in the most challenging of their image data.

While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF) module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention. To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/DiffMark.</p></details> |  |

However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation.

During inference, actions are sampled from the learned distribution and executed on the robot. However, sampled actions may fail for various reasons, and simply repeating the sampling step until a successful action is obtained can be inefficient. In this work, we propose an enhanced sampling strategy that refines the sampling distribution to avoid previously unsuccessful actions. We demonstrate that by solely utilizing data from successful demonstrations, our method can infer recovery actions without the need for additional exploratory behavior or a high-level controller. Furthermore, we leverage the concept of diffusion model decomposition to break down the primary problem, which may require long-horizon history to manage failures, into multiple smaller, more manageable sub-problems in learning, data collection, and inference, thereby enabling the system to adapt to variable failure counts. Our approach yields a low-level controller that dynamically adjusts its sampling space to improve efficiency when prior samples fall short. We validate our method across several tasks, including door opening with unknown directions, object manipulation, and button-searching scenarios, demonstrating that our approach outperforms traditional baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels, will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.</p></details> |  |

While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

Existing parameter compression methods primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g., FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\% while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for efficient text-to-image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
