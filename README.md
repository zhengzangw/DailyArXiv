| **[Light-X: Generative 4D Video Rendering with Camera and Illumination Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05115v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in illumination control extend image-based methods to video, yet still facing a trade-off between lighting fidelity and temporal consistency. Moving beyond relighting, a key step toward generative modeling of real-world scenes is the joint control of camera trajectory and illumination, since visual dynamics are inherently shaped by both geometry and lighting. To this end, we present Light-X, a video generation framework that enables controllable rendering from monocular videos with both viewpoint and illumination control. 1) We propose a disentangled design that decouples geometry and lighting signals: geometry and motion are captured via dynamic point clouds projected along user-defined camera trajectories, while illumination cues are provided by a relit frame consistently projected into the same geometry. These explicit, fine-grained cues enable effective disentanglement and guide high-quality illumination. 2) To address the lack of paired multi-view and multi-illumination videos, we introduce Light-Syn, a degradation-based pipeline with inverse-mapping that synthesizes training pairs from in-the-wild monocular footage. This strategy yields a dataset covering static, dynamic, and AI-generated scenes, ensuring robust training. Extensive experiments show that Light-X outperforms baseline methods in joint camera-illumination control and surpasses prior video relighting methods under both text- and background-conditioned settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://lightx-ai.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[NeuralRemaster: Phase-Preserving Diffusion for Structure-Aligned Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05106v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard diffusion corrupts data using Gaussian noise whose Fourier coefficients have random magnitudes and random phases. While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion φ-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. φ-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, φ-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, φ-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation. Videos, additional examples, and code are available on our \href{https://yuzeng-at-tri.github.io/ppd-page/}{project page}.</p></details> |  |
| **[TV2TV: A Unified Framework for Interleaved Language and Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05103v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models are rapidly advancing, but can still struggle with complex video outputs that require significant semantic branching or repeated high-level reasoning about what should happen next. In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to "think in words" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generated Human Videos to Physically Plausible Robot Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05094v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models are rapidly improving in their ability to synthesize human actions in novel contexts, holding the potential to serve as high-level planners for contextual robot control. To realize this potential, a key research question remains open: how can a humanoid execute the human actions from generated videos in a zero-shot manner? This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards. As a result, GenMimic can mimic human actions from noisy, generated videos. We curate GenMimicBench, a synthetic human-motion dataset generated using two video generation models across a spectrum of actions and contexts, establishing a benchmark for assessing zero-shot generalization and policy robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements over strong baselines in simulation and confirm coherent, physically stable motion tracking on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot without fine-tuning. This work offers a promising path to realizing the potential of video generation models as high-level policies for robot control.</p></details> | <details><summary>For p...</summary><p>For project website, see https://genmimic.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Deep Forcing: Training-Free Long Video Generation with Deep Sink and Participative Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05081v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in autoregressive video diffusion have enabled real-time frame streaming, yet existing solutions still suffer from temporal repetition, drift, and motion deceleration. We find that naively applying StreamingLLM-style attention sinks to video diffusion leads to fidelity degradation and motion stagnation. To overcome this, we introduce Deep Forcing, which consists of two training-free mechanisms that address this without any fine-tuning. Specifically, 1) Deep Sink dedicates half of the sliding window to persistent sink tokens and re-aligns their temporal RoPE phase to the current timeline, stabilizing global context during long rollouts. 2) Participative Compression performs importance-aware KV cache pruning that preserves only tokens actively participating in recent attention while safely discarding redundant and degraded history, minimizing error accumulation under out-of-distribution length generation. Together, these components enable over 12x extrapolation (e.g. 5s-trained to 60s+ generation) with better imaging quality than LongLive, better aesthetic quality than RollingForcing, almost maintaining overall consistency, and substantial gains in dynamic degree, all while maintaining real-time generation. Our results demonstrate that training-free KV-cache management can match or exceed training-based approaches for autoregressively streaming long-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/DeepForcing/</p></details> |
| **[Object Reconstruction under Occlusion with Generative Priors and Contact-induced Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05079v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object geometry is key information for robot manipulation. Yet, object reconstruction is a challenging task because cameras only capture partial observations of objects, especially when occlusion occurs. In this paper, we leverage two extra sources of information to reduce the ambiguity of vision signals. First, generative models learn priors of the shapes of commonly seen objects, allowing us to make reasonable guesses of the unseen part of geometry. Second, contact information, which can be obtained from videos and physical interactions, provides sparse constraints on the boundary of the geometry. We combine the two sources of information through contact-guided 3D generation. The guidance formulation is inspired by drag-based editing in generative models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our approach improves the reconstruction compared to pure 3D generation and contact-based optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://contactgen3d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[BulletTime: Decoupled Control of Time and Camera Pose for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05076v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging video diffusion models achieve high visual fidelity but fundamentally couple scene dynamics with camera motion, limiting their ability to provide precise spatial and temporal control. We introduce a 4D-controllable video diffusion framework that explicitly decouples scene dynamics from camera pose, enabling fine-grained manipulation of both scene dynamics and camera viewpoint. Our framework takes continuous world-time sequences and camera trajectories as conditioning inputs, injecting them into the video diffusion model through a 4D positional encoding in the attention layer and adaptive normalizations for feature modulation. To train this model, we curate a unique dataset in which temporal and camera variations are independently parameterized; this dataset will be made public. Experiments show that our model achieves robust real-world 4D control across diverse timing patterns and camera trajectories, while preserving high generation quality and outperforming prior work in controllability.

| **[Joint 3D Geometry Reconstruction and Motion Generation for 4D Synthesis from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05044v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating interactive and dynamic 4D scenes from a single static image remains a core challenge. Most existing generate-then-reconstruct and reconstruct-then-generate methods decouple geometry from motion, causing spatiotemporal inconsistencies and poor generalization. To address these, we extend the reconstruct-then-generate framework to jointly perform Motion generation and geometric Reconstruction for 4D Synthesis (MoRe4D). We first introduce TrajScene-60K, a large-scale dataset of 60,000 video samples with dense point trajectories, addressing the scarcity of high-quality 4D scene data. Based on this, we propose a diffusion-based 4D Scene Trajectory Generator (4D-STraG) to jointly generate geometrically consistent and motion-plausible 4D point trajectories. To leverage single-view priors, we design a depth-guided motion normalization strategy and a motion-aware module for effective geometry and dynamics integration. We then propose a 4D View Synthesis Module (4D-ViSM) to render videos with arbitrary camera trajectories from 4D point track representations. Experiments show that MoRe4D generates high-quality 4D scenes with multi-view consistency and rich dynamic details from a single image.

| **[Generative Neural Video Compression via Video Diffusion Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05016v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GNVC-VD, the first DiT-based generative neural video compression framework built upon an advanced video generation foundation model, where spatio-temporal latent compression and sequence-level generative refinement are unified within a single codec. Existing perceptual codecs primarily rely on pre-trained image generative priors to restore high-frequency details, but their frame-wise nature lacks temporal modeling and inevitably leads to perceptual flickering. To address this, GNVC-VD introduces a unified flow-matching latent refinement module that leverages a video diffusion transformer to jointly enhance intra- and inter-frame latents through sequence-level denoising, ensuring consistent spatio-temporal details. Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian noise as in video generation, GNVC-VD initializes refinement from decoded spatio-temporal latents and learns a correction term that adapts the diffusion prior to compression-induced degradation. A conditioning adaptor further injects compression-aware cues into intermediate DiT layers, enabling effective artifact removal while maintaining temporal coherence under extreme bitrate constraints. Extensive experiments show that GNVC-VD surpasses both traditional and learned codecs in perceptual quality and significantly reduces the flickering artifacts that persist in prior generative approaches, even below 0.01 bpp, highlighting the promise of integrating video-native generative priors into neural codecs for next-generation perceptual video compression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring YouTube's Political Communication Networks during the 2024 French Elections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04971v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 2024, France was shaken by the far-right National Rally's victory in the European elections. In response to this unprecedented result, French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly, triggering legislative elections just two weeks later. A whirlwind campaign followed, partly on social media, as is now the norm, and concluded with the victory of a left-wing coalition. This article examines the YouTube activity of two key actors during this period, news media and politicians, and the commenting behavior they generated. We built a dataset of 35 news media channels, 28 politicians and parties channels, 43.5k videos posted from three months before the European elections to one week after the second round of the legislative elections, and 7.4M associated comments. We examined upload activity and engagement across political orientations and used network analysis methods to uncover the structure of their commenting communities. We also identified politicians' appearances on news media channels and assessed their impact on commenting user bases. Our findings show that, among politicians and parties channels, far-right and left-wing ones were significantly more active and received substantially higher engagement (views, likes, and comments) than other groups, with denser and more clustered commenting communities. About 7% of commenters commented across political orientations and were much more active than in-group commenters. News media channels tended to favor politically aligned guests, while centrist politicians were over-represented. Finally, politicians' presence in the videos of a specific news media channel increased the share of commenters who were active on this channel and political channels, regardless of their orientation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, to be published in ICWSM'2026</p></details> |
| **[TongUI: Internet-Scale Trajectories from Multimodal Web Tutorials for Generalized GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12679v4)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents is a promising research direction, which simulates human interaction with computers or mobile phones to perform diverse GUI tasks. However, a major challenge in developing generalized GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications. We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net, which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\% on multiple benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring the significance of our TongUI framework. We will fully open-source the code, the GUI-Net dataset, and the trained models soon.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[Contact-Aware Refinement of Human Pose Pseudo-Ground Truth via Bioimpedance Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04862v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing accurate 3D human pose in the wild would provide valuable data for training pose estimation and motion generation methods. While video-based estimation approaches have become increasingly accurate, they often fail in common scenarios involving self-contact, such as a hand touching the face. In contrast, wearable bioimpedance sensing can cheaply and unobtrusively measure ground-truth skin-to-skin contact. Consequently, we propose a novel framework that combines visual pose estimators with bioimpedance sensing to capture the 3D pose of people by taking self-contact into account. Our method, BioTUCH, initializes the pose using an off-the-shelf estimator and introduces contact-aware pose optimization during measured self-contact: reprojection error and deviations from the input estimate are minimized while enforcing vertex proximity constraints. We validate our approach using a new dataset of synchronized RGB video, bioimpedance measurements, and 3D motion capture. Testing with three input pose estimators, we demonstrate an average of 11.7% improvement in reconstruction accuracy. We also present a miniature wearable bioimpedance sensor that enables efficient large-scale collection of contact-aware training data for improving pose estimation and generation using BioTUCH.

| **[GigaBrain-0: A World Model-Powered Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19430v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain0.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Reward Forcing: Efficient Streaming Video Generation with Rewarded Distribution Matching Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04678v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient streaming video generation is critical for simulating interactive and dynamic worlds. Existing methods distill few-step video diffusion models with sliding window attention, using initial frames as sink tokens to maintain attention performance and reduce error accumulation. However, video frames become overly dependent on these static tokens, resulting in copied initial frames and diminished motion dynamics. To address this, we introduce Reward Forcing, a novel framework with two key designs. First, we propose EMA-Sink, which maintains fixed-size tokens initialized from initial frames and continuously updated by fusing evicted tokens via exponential moving average as they exit the sliding window. Without additional computation cost, EMA-Sink tokens capture both long-term context and recent dynamics, preventing initial frame copying while maintaining long-horizon consistency. Second, to better distill motion dynamics from teacher models, we propose a novel Rewarded Distribution Matching Distillation (Re-DMD). Vanilla distribution matching treats every training sample equally, limiting the model's ability to prioritize dynamic content. Instead, Re-DMD biases the model's output distribution toward high-reward regions by prioritizing samples with greater dynamics rated by a vision-language model. Re-DMD significantly enhances motion quality while preserving data fidelity. We include both quantitative and qualitative experiments to show that Reward Forcing achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while enabling high-quality streaming video generation at 23.1 FPS on a single H100 GPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Live Avatar: Streaming Real-time Audio-Driven Avatar Generation with Infinite Length](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04677v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing diffusion-based video generation methods are fundamentally constrained by sequential computation and long-horizon inconsistency, limiting their practical adoption in real-time, streaming audio-driven avatar synthesis. We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image. Additionally, we leverage Self-Forcing Distribution Matching Distillation to facilitate causal, streamable adaptation of large-scale models without sacrificing visual quality. Live Avatar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reaching 20 FPS end-to-end generation on 5 H800 GPUs, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve practical, real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation at this scale. Our work establishes a new paradigm for deploying advanced diffusion models in industrial long-form video synthesis applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEASON: Mitigating Temporal Hallucination in Video Large Language Models via Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04643v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in video understanding. However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Indoor Radio Mapping Dataset Combining 3D Point Clouds and RSSI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00494v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing number of smart devices supporting bandwidth-intensive and latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time video analytics, smart sensing, Extended Reality (XR), etc., necessitates reliable wireless connectivity in indoor environments. In such environments, accurate design of Radio Environment Maps (REMs) enables adaptive wireless network planning and optimization of Access Point (AP) placement. However, generating realistic REMs remains difficult due to the variability of indoor environments and the limitations of existing modeling approaches, which often rely on simplified layouts or fully synthetic data. These challenges are further amplified by the adoption of next-generation Wi-Fi standards, which operate at higher frequencies and suffer from limited range and wall penetration. To support the efforts in addressing these challenges, we collected a dataset that combines high-resolution 3D LiDAR scans with Wi-Fi RSSI measurements collected across 20 setups in a multi-room indoor environment. The dataset includes two measurement scenarios, the first without human presence in the environment, and the second with human presence, enabling the development and validation of REM estimation models that incorporate physical geometry and environmental dynamics. The described dataset supports research in data-driven wireless modeling and the development of high-capacity indoor communication networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, under review to Nature Scientific Data</p></details> |

With the growing prevalence of deepfake technology, which can manipulate facial features in images and videos, the potential for fraud in online transactions has escalated. Traditional security systems struggle to identify these sophisticated forms of fraud.

This approach significantly improves the robustness of payment systems against AI-driven fraud.

However, existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' ability to identify and correct these video reasoning errors. To bridge this gap, we propose ViRectify, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their fine-grained correction capability. Through an AI-assisted annotation pipeline with human verification, we construct a dataset of over 30K instances spanning dynamic perception, scientific reasoning, and embodied decision-making domains. In ViRectify, we challenge MLLMs to perform step-wise error identification and generate rationales with key video evidence grounding. In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our ViRectify serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on ViRectify, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning. We believe ViRectify provides a new direction for comprehensively evaluating the advanced MLLMs in video reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages, 11 figures |

To address this, recent works have attempted to construct external knowledge bases and corresponding retrieval agumented generation (RAG) systems, yet these incur enormous storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VideoMem, a novel framework that pioneers models long video understanding as a sequential generation task via adaptive memory management. Specifically, VideoMem dynamically updates a global memory buffer, which adaptively retains critical information while discarding redundant content across the video timeline. To efficiently train VLMs for such long-term tasks, VideoMem integrates the Progressive Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO) algorithm, equipped with two core modules: Progressive State Propagation (PSP) adaptively retains valid current states, propagates them to the next rollout step, and gradually narrows the model exploration space. Temporal Cascading Reward (TCR) further alleviates reward sparsity, improving sample utilization and accelerating convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoMem significantly outperforms existing open-source models across diverse benchmarks for ultra-long video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-Humanoid: Robotize Human Videos to Generate Humanoid Videos at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04537v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of embodied AI has unlocked significant potential for intelligent humanoid robots. However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to "robotize" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly "overlay" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million "robotized" humanoid video frames. Quantitative analysis and user studies confirm our method's superiority over existing baselines: 69% of users rated it best for motion consistency, and 62.1% for embodiment correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhyVLLM: Physics-Guided Video Language Model with Motion-Appearance Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04532v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide range of video-language tasks. However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations. The resulting motion-aware representations are projected into the token space of a pretrained LLM, enabling physics reasoning without compromising the model's original multimodal capabilities. To circumvent the need for explicit physical labels, PhyVLLM employs a self-supervised manner to model the continuous evolution of object motion. Experimental results demonstrate that PhyVLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Video LLMs on both physical reasoning and general video understanding tasks, highlighting the advantages of incorporating explicit physical modeling.</p></details> |  |

We approach this problem from a memory perspective, treating video synthesis as a recurrent dynamical process that requires coordinated short- and long-term context. We propose VideoSSM, a Long Video Model that unifies AR diffusion with a hybrid state-space memory. The state-space model (SSM) serves as an evolving global memory of scene dynamics across the entire sequence, while a context window provides local memory for motion cues and fine details. This hybrid design preserves global consistency without frozen, repetitive patterns, supports prompt-adaptive interaction, and scales in linear time with sequence length. Experiments on short- and long-range benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art temporal consistency and motion stability among autoregressive video generator especially at minute-scale horizons, enabling content diversity and interactive prompt-based control, thereby establishing a scalable, memory-aware framework for long video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Face Experts Fusion in Video Generation: Boosting Identity Consistency Across Large Face Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09476v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under large face poses, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT architectures, and the lack of targeted coverage of large face poses in existing open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations. First, we propose Collaborative Face Experts Fusion (CoFE), which dynamically fuses complementary signals from three specialized experts within the DiT backbone: an identity expert that captures cross-pose invariant features, a semantic expert that encodes high-level visual context, and a detail expert that preserves pixel-level attributes such as skin texture and color gradients. Second, we introduce a data curation pipeline comprising three key components: Face Constraints to ensure diverse large-pose coverage, Identity Consistency to maintain stable identity across frames, and Speech Disambiguation to align textual captions with actual speaking behavior. This pipeline yields LaFID-180K, a large-scale dataset of pose-annotated video clips designed for identity-preserving video generation. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in face similarity, FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. \href{https://rain152.github.io/CoFE/}{Project page}.</p></details> | <details><summary>\href...</summary><p>\href{https://rain152.github.io/CoFE/}{Project page}</p></details> |

Existing autoregressive models suffer from content drift, where object identity and scene semantics degrade over time. To address this challenge, we introduce EgoLCD, an end-to-end framework for egocentric long-context video generation that treats long video synthesis as a problem of efficient and stable memory management. EgoLCD combines a Long-Term Sparse KV Cache for stable global context with an attention-based short-term memory, extended by LoRA for local adaptation. A Memory Regulation Loss enforces consistent memory usage, and Structured Narrative Prompting provides explicit temporal guidance. Extensive experiments on the EgoVid-5M benchmark demonstrate that EgoLCD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual quality and temporal consistency, effectively mitigating generative forgetting and representing a significant step toward building scalable world models for embodied AI.

However, existing prompt-based synthesis methods struggle to capture domain-specific data distributions, particularly in data-scarce domains, and often overlook fine-grained relevance diversity. In this paper, we present a Chinese short video dataset with 4-level relevance annotations, filling a critical resource void. Further, we propose a semi-supervised synthetic data pipeline where two collaboratively trained models generate domain-adaptive short video data with controllable relevance labels. Our method enhances relevance-level diversity by synthesizing samples for underrepresented intermediate relevance labels, resulting in a more balanced and semantically rich training data set. Extensive offline experiments show that the embedding model trained on our synthesized data outperforms those using data generated based on prompting or vanilla supervised fine-tuning(SFT). Moreover, we demonstrate that incorporating more diverse fine-grained relevance levels in training data enhances the model's sensitivity to subtle semantic distinctions, highlighting the value of fine-grained relevance supervision in embedding learning. In the search enhanced recommendation pipeline of Douyin's dual-column scenario, through online A/B testing, the proposed model increased click-through rate(CTR) by 1.45%, raised the proportion of Strong Relevance Ratio (SRR) by 4.9%, and improved the Image User Penetration Rate (IUPR) by 0.1054%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Zero-shot, identity-preserving models such as Insert Anything and OminiControl now support applications like virtual try-on without requiring additional fine-tuning. While these models may be fitting for humans and rigid everyday objects, they still have limitations for non-rigid or fine-grained categories. These domains often lack accessible, high-quality data -- especially videos or multi-view observations of the same subject -- making them difficult both to evaluate and to improve upon. Yet, such domains are essential for moving beyond content creation toward applications that demand accuracy and fine detail. Birds are an excellent domain for this task: they exhibit high diversity, require fine-grained cues for identification, and come in a wide variety of poses. We introduce the NABirds Look-Alikes (NABLA) dataset, consisting of 4,759 expert-curated image pairs. Together with 1,073 pairs collected from multi-image observations on iNaturalist and a small set of videos, this forms a benchmark for evaluating identity-preserving generation of birds. We show that state-of-the-art baselines fail to maintain identity on this dataset, and we demonstrate that training on images grouped by species, age, and sex -- used as a proxy for identity -- substantially improves performance on both seen and unseen species.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, DeRA maintains a compact 1D latent space while factorizing video encoding into appearance and motion streams, which are aligned with pretrained vision foundation models to capture the spatial semantics and temporal dynamics in videos separately. To address the gradient conflicts introduced by the heterogeneous supervision, we further propose the Symmetric Alignment-Conflict Projection (SACP) module that proactively reformulates gradients by suppressing the components along conflicting directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeRA outperforms LARP, the previous state-of-the-art video tokenizer by 25% on UCF-101 in terms of rFVD. Moreover, using DeRA for autoregressive video generation, we also achieve new state-of-the-art results on both UCF-101 class-conditional generation and K600 frame prediction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zero4dvid.github.io/</p></details> |

In such settings, an agent must maintain situational awareness of its environment, comprehend the interactions with surrounding entities, and dynamically plan actions informed by past observations, current contexts, and anticipated future events. To facilitate progress in this direction, we introduce StreamEQA, the first benchmark designed for streaming video question answering in embodied scenarios. StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming. Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context. Built upon 156 independent long videos, StreamEQA defines 42 tasks and generates approximately 21K question-answer pairs with precise timestamps through a hybrid pipeline combining automated generation and human refinement. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art video-LLMs reveal that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models still struggle with streaming video understanding in embodied scenarios. We hope StreamEQA will catalyze research on streaming video understanding for embodied applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Policy Evaluation with Video World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11520v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training generalist policies for robotic manipulation has shown great promise, as they enable language-conditioned, multi-task behaviors across diverse scenarios. However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It also requires frequent environment resets and carries safety risks when deploying unproven policies on physical robots. Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation. Our paper examines the effect of dataset diversity, pre-trained weights, and common failure cases for the proposed evaluation pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that across various metrics, including policy ranking and the correlation between actual policy values and predicted policy values, these models offer a promising approach for evaluating policies without requiring real-world interactions.</p></details> |  |

Humans perceive and interact with a fully 3D world, developing spatial awareness that extends beyond text-based understanding. However, most previous works learn from 1D text or 2D visual cues, such as bounding boxes, which inherently lack 3D understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoDTM, an Egocentric Depth- and Text-aware Model, jointly trained through large-scale 3D-aware video pretraining and video-text contrastive learning. EgoDTM incorporates a lightweight 3D-aware decoder to efficiently learn 3D-awareness from pseudo depth maps generated by depth estimation models. To further facilitate 3D-aware video pretraining, we enrich the original brief captions with hand-object visual cues by organically combining several foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate EgoDTM's superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting its superior 3D-aware visual understanding.

Currently, most existing automatic trailer generation methods employ a "selection-then-ranking" paradigm (i.e., first selecting key shots and then ranking them), which suffers from inevitable error propagation and limits the quality of the generated trailers. Beyond this paradigm, we propose a new self-paced and self-corrective masked prediction method called SSMP, which achieves state-of-the-art results in automatic trailer generation via bi-directional contextual modeling and progressive self-correction. In particular, SSMP trains a Transformer encoder that takes the movie shot sequences as prompts and generates corresponding trailer shot sequences accordingly. The model is trained via masked prediction, reconstructing each trailer shot sequence from its randomly masked counterpart. The mask ratio is self-paced, allowing the task difficulty to adapt to the model and thereby improving model performance. When generating a movie trailer, the model fills the shot positions with high confidence at each step and re-masks the remaining positions for the next prediction, forming a progressive self-correction mechanism that is analogous to how human editors work. Both quantitative results and user studies demonstrate the superiority of SSMP in comparison to existing automatic movie trailer generation methods. Demo is available at: https://github.com/Dixin-Lab/SSMP.</p></details> |  |

While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for improving temporal reasoning, existing approaches are often confined to limited task types and data, restricting their generalization across diverse temporal understanding scenarios. To address this challenge, we present TempR1, a temporal-aware multi-task reinforcement learning framework that systematically strengthens MLLMs' temporal comprehension. We curate a multi-task corpus that exposes the model to diverse temporal structures and semantics, and build upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to achieve stable and effective cross-task optimization. Specifically, we categorize temporal tasks into three correspondence types between predicted intervals and ground-truth instances, and design tailored localization rewards for each, enabling TempR1 to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and adapt to different temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempR1 attains state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, its joint optimization over complementary tasks yields a strong synergistic effect, enhancing both generalization and single-task performance, establishing a scalable and principled paradigm for temporal reasoning in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

We present FMA-Net++, a framework for joint video super-resolution and deblurring that explicitly models this coupled effect of motion and dynamically varying exposure. FMA-Net++ adopts a sequence-level architecture built from Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks, enabling parallel, long-range temporal modeling. Within each block, an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer conditions features on per-frame exposure, which in turn drives an exposure-aware Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module to infer motion- and exposure-aware degradation kernels. FMA-Net++ decouples degradation learning from restoration: the former predicts exposure- and motion-aware priors to guide the latter, improving both accuracy and efficiency. To evaluate under realistic capture conditions, we introduce REDS-ME (multi-exposure) and REDS-RE (random-exposure) benchmarks. Trained solely on synthetic data, FMA-Net++ achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal consistency on our new benchmarks and GoPro, outperforming recent methods in both restoration quality and inference speed, and generalizes well to challenging real-world videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 15 figures.

| **[AgentBay: A Hybrid Interaction Sandbox for Seamless Human-AI Intervention in Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04367v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is catalyzing a shift towards autonomous AI Agents capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks. However, these agents remain brittle when faced with real-world exceptions, making Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) supervision essential for mission-critical applications. In this paper, we present AgentBay, a novel sandbox service designed from the ground up for hybrid interaction. AgentBay provides secure, isolated execution environments spanning Windows, Linux, Android, Web Browsers, and Code interpreters. Its core contribution is a unified session accessible via a hybrid control interface: An AI agent can interact programmatically via mainstream interfaces (MCP, Open Source SDK), while a human operator can, at any moment, seamlessly take over full manual control. This seamless intervention is enabled by Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP). Unlike traditional VNC/RDP, ASP is specifically engineered for this hybrid use case, delivering an ultra-low-latency, smoother user experience that remains resilient even in weak network environments. It achieves this by dynamically blending command-based and video-based streaming, adapting its encoding strategy based on network conditions and the current controller (AI or human). Our evaluation demonstrates strong results in security, performance, and task completion rates. In a benchmark of complex tasks, the AgentBay (Agent + Human) model achieved more than 48% success rate improvement. Furthermore, our ASP protocol reduces bandwidth consumption by up to 50% compared to standard RDP, and in end-to-end latency with around 5% reduction, especially under poor network conditions. We posit that AgentBay provides a foundational primitive for building the next generation of reliable, human-supervised autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues. While prior works have explored alleviating hallucinations for static images, jointly mitigating visual object and temporal action hallucinations for dynamic videos remains a challenging and unsolved task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives. Furthermore, we develop a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment to match the regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual and temporal phrases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SANTA outperforms existing methods in alleviating object and action hallucinations, yielding superior performance on the hallucination examination benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026.

Most existing algorithms are often vulnerable to reward hacking, such as quality degradation, over-stylization, or reduced diversity. Our analysis demonstrates that this can be attributed to the inherent limitations of their regularization, which provides unreliable penalties. We introduce Data-regularized Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (DDRL), a novel framework that uses the forward KL divergence to anchor the policy to an off-policy data distribution. Theoretically, DDRL enables robust, unbiased integration of RL with standard diffusion training. Empirically, this translates into a simple yet effective algorithm that combines reward maximization with diffusion loss minimization. With over a million GPU hours of experiments and ten thousand double-blind human evaluations, we demonstrate on high-resolution video generation tasks that DDRL significantly improves rewards while alleviating the reward hacking seen in baselines, achieving the highest human preference and establishing a robust and scalable paradigm for diffusion post-training.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a multi-modal machine learning framework that combines image and galvanic skin response (GSR) data to predict early user trust in AI- or human-generated recommendations in a simulated ADHD mHealth context. Facial video data were processed using OpenCV for frame extraction and transferred learning with a pre-trained transformer model to derive emotional features. Concurrently, GSR signals were decomposed into tonic and phasic components to capture physiological arousal patterns. Two temporal windows were defined for trust prediction: the Early Detection Window (6 to 3 seconds before decision-making) and the Proximal Detection Window (3 to 0 seconds before decision-making). For each window, trust prediction was conducted separately using image-based, GSR-based, and multimodal (image + GSR) features. Each modality was analyzed using machine learning algorithms, and the top-performing unimodal models were integrated through a multimodal stacking ensemble for final prediction. Experimental results showed that combining facial and physiological cues significantly improved prediction performance. The multimodal stacking framework achieved an accuracy of 0.83, F1-score of 0.88, and ROC-AUC of 0.87 in the Early Detection Window, and an accuracy of 0.75, F1-score of 0.82, and ROC-AUC of 0.66 in the Proximal Detection Window. These results demonstrate the potential of bio signals as real-time, objective markers of user trust, enabling adaptive AI systems that dynamically adjust their responses to maintain calibrated trust which is a critical capability in mental health applications where mis-calibrated trust can affect diagnostic and treatment outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version contains errors in content presentation and arrangement, so it is being withdrawn until a corrected version is generated</p></details> |

We present a novel multi-video 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach designed to handle real-world, unsynchronized video sets. Our approach, SyncTrack4D, directly leverages dense 4D track representation of dynamic scene parts as cues for simultaneous cross-video synchronization and 4DGS reconstruction. We first compute dense per-video 4D feature tracks and cross-video track correspondences by Fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport approach. Next, we perform global frame-level temporal alignment to maximize overlapping motion of matched 4D tracks. Finally, we achieve sub-frame synchronization through our multi-video 4D Gaussian splatting built upon a motion-spline scaffold representation. The final output is a synchronized 4DGS representation with dense, explicit 3D trajectories, and temporal offsets for each video. We evaluate our approach on the Panoptic Studio and SyncNeRF Blender, demonstrating sub-frame synchronization accuracy with an average temporal error below 0.26 frames, and high-fidelity 4D reconstruction reaching 26.3 PSNR scores on the Panoptic Studio dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first general 4D Gaussian Splatting approach for unsynchronized video sets, without assuming the existence of predefined scene objects or prior models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-time Stochastic Refinement of GRU-Normalizing Flow for Real-time Video Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04282v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time video motion transfer applications such as immersive gaming and vision-based anomaly detection require accurate yet diverse future predictions to support realistic synthesis and robust downstream decision making under uncertainty. To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively. These results highlight the potential of integrating stochastic dynamics with flow-based sequence models for generative time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we systematically study Newtonian motion-controlled text-to-video generation and evaluation, emphasizing physical precision and motion coherence. We introduce MoReGen, a motion-aware, physics-grounded T2V framework that integrates multi-agent LLMs, physics simulators, and renderers to generate reproducible, physically accurate videos from text prompts in the code domain. To quantitatively assess physical validity, we propose object-trajectory correspondence as a direct evaluation metric and present MoReSet, a benchmark of 1,275 human-annotated videos spanning nine classes of Newtonian phenomena with scene descriptions, spatiotemporal relations, and ground-truth trajectories. Using MoReSet, we conduct experiments on existing T2V models, evaluating their physical validity through both our MoRe metrics and existing physics-based evaluators. Our results reveal that state-of-the-art models struggle to maintain physical validity, while MoReGen establishes a principled direction toward physically coherent video synthesis.</p></details> |  |

A recent approach to tackle this issue is to train a network with pristine face images that have been manipulated with hand-crafted artifacts to extract more generalizable clues. While effective for static images, extending this to the video domain is an open issue. Existing methods model temporal artifacts as frame-to-frame instabilities, overlooking a key vulnerability: the violation of natural motion dependencies between different facial regions. In this paper, we propose a synthetic video generation method that creates training data with subtle kinematic inconsistencies. We train an autoencoder to decompose facial landmark configurations into motion bases. By manipulating these bases, we selectively break the natural correlations in facial movements and introduce these artifacts into pristine videos via face morphing. A network trained on our data learns to spot these sophisticated biomechanical flaws, achieving state-of-the-art generalization results on several popular benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages. However, this field has made slow progress due to the inaccuracy of text conversion, pose generation, and the rendering of poses into real human videos in these stages, resulting in gradually accumulating errors. Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos. SLUL is trained using the newly developed Semantic-Aware Gloss Masking Loss (SAGM Loss).

While recent works such as Marigold and Lotus adapt diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization, their potential for structured outputs remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose SDPose, a fine-tuning framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate robustness under domain shift, we further construct COCO-OOD, a style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD. Extensive ablations highlight the importance of diffusion priors, RGB reconstruction, and multi-scale SD U-Net features for cross-domain generalization, and t-SNE analyses further explain SD's domain-invariant latent structure. We also show that SDPose serves as an effective zero-shot pose annotator for controllable image and video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches address only one of these aspects in isolation, as achieving all three simultaneously is highly challenging-for example, long-term memory mechanisms often degrade real-time performance. In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work. These capabilities establish RELIC as a strong foundation for the next generation of interactive world modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[PSA: Pyramid Sparse Attention for Efficient Video Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04025v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms are the core of foundation models, but their quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for scaling. This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs. Our code and model weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/PSA</p></details> | Tech report |

Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters.

Current methods predominantly focus on generating one modality given another as the condition or integrating either of them with other modalities such as text and audio. Unifying 2D videos and 3D motions for simultaneous optimization and generation remains largely unexplored, presenting significant challenges due to their substantial structural and distributional differences. Inspired by the LLM's ability to unify different modalities, our method models videos and 3D motions as a unified tokens sequence, utilizing separate embedding layers to mitigate distribution gaps. Additionally, we devise a sequence modeling strategy that integrates two distinct tasks within a single framework, proving the effectiveness of unified modeling. Moreover, to efficiently align with visual tokens and preserve 3D spatial information, we design a novel 3D motion tokenizer with a temporal expansion strategy, using a single VQ-VAE to produce quantized motion tokens. It features multiple expert decoders that handle body shapes, translation, global orientation, and body poses for reliable 3D motion reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method simultaneously generates corresponding videos and motions while performing accurate motion capture. This work taps into the capacity of LLMs to fuse diverse data types, paving the way for integrating human-centric information into existing models and potentially enabling multimodal, controllable joint modeling of humans, objects, and scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://carlyx.github.io/UniMo/</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Video Translation and Editing with Frame Spatial-Temporal Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03905v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable success in text-to-image diffusion models has motivated extensive investigation of their potential for video applications. Zero-shot techniques aim to adapt image diffusion models for videos without requiring further model training. Recent methods largely emphasize integrating inter-frame correspondence into attention mechanisms. However, the soft constraint applied to identify the valid features to attend is insufficient, which could lead to temporal inconsistency. In this paper, we present FRESCO, which integrates intra-frame correspondence with inter-frame correspondence to formulate a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This enhancement ensures a consistent transformation of semantically similar content between frames. Our method goes beyond attention guidance to explicitly optimize features, achieving high spatial-temporal consistency with the input video, significantly enhancing the visual coherence of manipulated videos. We verify FRESCO adaptations on two zero-shot tasks of video-to-video translation and text-guided video editing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating high-quality, coherent videos, highlighting a significant advance over current zero-shot methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Sunnycookies/FRESCO-v2, Project: https://williamyang1991.github.io/projects/FRESCOv2/</p></details> |

Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene graphs from video clips, enabling applications in intelligent surveillance and human-machine collaboration. While recent SGA approaches excel at leveraging visual evidence, long-horizon forecasting fundamentally depends on semantic priors and commonsense temporal regularities that are challenging to extract purely from visual features. To explicitly model these semantic dynamics, we propose Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation (LSGA), a linguistic formulation of SGA that performs temporal relational reasoning over sequences of textualized scene graphs, with visual scene-graph detection handled by a modular front-end when operating on video. Building on this formulation, we introduce Object-Oriented Two-Stage Method (OOTSM), a language-based framework that anticipates object-set dynamics and forecasts object-centric relation trajectories with temporal consistency regularization, and we evaluate it on a dedicated benchmark constructed from Action Genome annotations. Extensive experiments show that compact fine-tuned language models with up to 3B parameters consistently outperform strong zero- and one-shot API baselines, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3, under matched textual inputs and context windows. When coupled with off-the-shelf visual scene-graph generators, the resulting multimodal system achieves substantial improvements on video-based SGA, boosting long-horizon mR@50 by up to 21.9\% over strong visual SGA baselines.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience, particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.</p></details> |  |

This leaves broader training scenarios and resources underexplored, limiting the exploration and learning of Vision Language Models (VLMs) through RL. We find video games inherently provide rich visual elements and mechanics that are easy to verify. To fully use the multimodal and verifiable reward in video games, we propose Game-RL, constructing diverse game tasks for RL training to boost VLMs general reasoning ability. To obtain training data, we propose Code2Logic, a novel approach that adapts game code to synthesize game reasoning task data, thus obtaining the GameQA dataset of 30 games and 158 tasks with controllable difficulty gradation. Unexpectedly, RL training solely on GameQA enables multiple VLMs to achieve performance improvements across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating the value of Game-RL for enhancing VLMs' general reasoning. Furthermore, this suggests that video games may serve as valuable scenarios and resources to boost general reasoning abilities.

Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.

While repair-based methods fail to restore complex artifacts and LiDAR-based approaches rely on sparse and incomplete cues, ReCamDriving leverages dense and scene-complete 3DGS renderings for explicit geometric guidance, achieving precise camera-controllable generation. To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCamDriving achieves state-of-the-art camera controllability and structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://recamdriving.github.io/</p></details> |

Among these, motion control - specifying object dynamics and camera trajectories - is essential for composing complex, cinematic scenes, yet existing interfaces remain limited. We introduce LAMP that leverages large language models (LLMs) as motion planners to translate natural language descriptions into explicit 3D trajectories for dynamic objects and (relatively defined) cameras. LAMP defines a motion domain-specific language (DSL), inspired by cinematography conventions. By harnessing program synthesis capabilities of LLMs, LAMP generates structured motion programs from natural language, which are deterministically mapped to 3D trajectories. We construct a large-scale procedural dataset pairing natural text descriptions with corresponding motion programs and 3D trajectories. Experiments demonstrate LAMP's improved performance in motion controllability and alignment with user intent compared to state-of-the-art alternatives establishing the first framework for generating both object and camera motions directly from natural language specifications.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, these models often lack 3D consistency, a fundamental requirement for understanding scene geometry and motion, thereby causing severe spatial misalignment and temporal flickering in complex 3D environments. In this paper, we present Motion4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating 2D priors from foundation models into a unified 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our method features a two-part iterative optimization framework: 1) Sequential optimization, which updates motion and semantic fields in consecutive stages to maintain local consistency, and 2) Global optimization, which jointly refines all attributes for long-term coherence. To enhance motion accuracy, we introduce a 3D confidence map that dynamically adjusts the motion priors, and an adaptive resampling process that inserts new Gaussians into under-represented regions based on per-pixel RGB and semantic errors. Furthermore, we enhance semantic coherence through an iterative refinement process that resolves semantic inconsistencies by alternately optimizing the semantic fields and updating prompts of SAM2. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our Motion4D significantly outperforms both 2D foundation models and existing 3D-based approaches across diverse scene understanding tasks, including point-based tracking, video object segmentation, and novel view synthesis.

Although recent diffusion-based approaches improve upon traditional optical-flow-based methods, they still struggle to cover diverse application scenarios and often fail to produce sharp, temporally consistent frames in fine-grained motion tasks such as audio-visual synchronized interpolation. To address these limitations, we introduce BBF (Beyond Boundary Frames), a context-aware video frame interpolation framework, which could be guided by audio/visual semantics. First, we enhance the input design of the interpolation model so that it can flexibly handle multiple conditional modalities, including text, audio, images, and video. Second, we propose a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism that sequentially injects different conditional signals into a DiT backbone. Finally, to maintain the generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt a progressive multi-stage training paradigm, where the start-end frame difference embedding is used to dynamically adjust both the data sampling and the loss weighting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BBF outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods on both generic interpolation and audio-visual synchronized interpolation tasks, establishing a unified framework for video frame interpolation under coordinated multi-channel conditioning.</p></details> |  |

In DOT-BI, a 'hidden' number is displayed with the same random black-and-white pixel texture as its background. Only the difference in motion and scale between the number and the background makes the number perceptible to humans across frames, while frame-by-frame algorithmic processing yields no meaningful signal. We conducted two preliminary assessments. Firstly, state-of-the-art, video-capable, multimodal models (GPT-5-Thinking and Gemini 2.5 Pro) fail to extract the correct value, even when given explicit instructions about the mechanism. Secondly, in an online survey (n=182), 99.5% (181/182) of participants solved the task, with an average end-to-end completion time of 10.7 seconds; a supervised lab study (n=39) found no negative effects on perceived ease-of-use or completion time relative to a control. We release code to generate tests and 100+ pre-rendered variants to facilitate adoption in surveys and online processes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist.

We present a hybrid moderation framework deployed at production scale that combines supervised classification for known violations with reference-based similarity matching for novel or subtle cases. This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight. In production, the classification pipeline achieves 67% recall at 80% precision, and the similarity pipeline achieves 76% recall at 80% precision. Large-scale A/B tests show a 6-8% reduction in user views of unwanted livestreams}. These results demonstrate a scalable and adaptable approach to multimodal content governance, capable of addressing both explicit violations and emerging adversarial behaviors.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2026 |

While prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data, they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature.

To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0. These results highlight that jointly scaling prompts and visuals is key to fully leveraging scaling laws at inference-time.

Given time-varying text prompts, FloodDiffusion generates text-aligned, seamless motion sequences with real-time latency. Unlike existing methods that rely on chunk-by-chunk or auto-regressive model with diffusion head, we adopt a diffusion forcing framework to model this time-series generation task under time-varying control events. We find that a straightforward implementation of vanilla diffusion forcing (as proposed for video models) fails to model real motion distributions. We demonstrate that to guarantee modeling the output distribution, the vanilla diffusion forcing must be tailored to: (i) train with a bi-directional attention instead of casual attention; (ii) implement a lower triangular time scheduler instead of a random one; (iii) utilize a continues time-varying way to introduce text conditioning. With these improvements, we demonstrate in the first time that the diffusion forcing-based framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the streaming motion generation task, reaching an FID of 0.057 on the HumanML3D benchmark. Models, code, and weights are available. https://shandaai.github.io/FloodDiffusion/</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Recent work integrates Gaussian Splatting (GS) into SLAM to enable dense, photorealistic 3D mapping, yet existing GS-based SLAM methods require per-scene optimization that is slow and consumes an excessive number of Gaussians. We present GS4, the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM system. Compared with prior approaches, GS4 runs 10x faster, uses 10x fewer Gaussians, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across color, depth, semantic mapping and camera tracking. From an RGB-D video stream, GS4 incrementally builds and updates a set of 3D Gaussians using a feed-forward network. First, the Gaussian Prediction Model estimates a sparse set of Gaussian parameters from input frame, which integrates both color and semantic prediction with the same backbone. Then, the Gaussian Refinement Network merges new Gaussians with the existing set while avoiding redundancy. Finally, when significant pose changes are detected, we perform only 1-5 iterations of joint Gaussian-pose optimization to correct drift, remove floaters, and further improve tracking accuracy. Experiments on the real-world ScanNet and ScanNet++ benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance, with strong generalization capability shown through zero-shot transfer to the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

Existing action-centric methods struggle with the flexibility of real procedures, where step order varies depending on object states. In this work, we propose to shift the focus to an object-centric paradigm by regarding actions as mechanisms that drive state transitions. To advance this direction, we introduce Object-IVQA, a long-form instructional video benchmark with 107 videos and 514 open-ended question-answer pairs annotated with temporally grounded evidence. The benchmark evaluates four dimensions of object-centric reasoning, including state evolution, precondition verification, counterfactual reasoning and mistake recognition. We further propose an agent framework that orchestrates object-centric planning, perception, analysis and generation tools, enabling explicit evidence retrieval and multi-hop reasoning across disjoint segments. Experiments show that existing large vision-language models struggle in object-level recognition and reasoning, whereas our framework achieves substantially improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoVideo: Introducing Geometric Regularization into Video Generation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03453v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of high-quality and visually realistic clips using diffusion transformer models. However, most existing approaches operate purely in the 2D pixel space and lack explicit mechanisms for modeling 3D structures, often resulting in temporally inconsistent geometries, implausible motions, and structural artifacts. In this work, we introduce geometric regularization losses into video generation by augmenting latent diffusion models with per-frame depth prediction. We adopted depth as the geometric representation because of the great progress in depth prediction and its compatibility with image-based latent encoders. Specifically, to enforce structural consistency over time, we propose a multi-view geometric loss that aligns the predicted depth maps across frames within a shared 3D coordinate system. Our method bridges the gap between appearance generation and 3D structure modeling, leading to improved spatio-temporal coherence, shape consistency, and physical plausibility. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our approach produces significantly more stable and geometrically consistent results than existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://geovideo.github.io/GeoVideo/</p></details> |

Transformer-based architectures (DiTs) and classifier-free guidance (CFG) are two cornerstones of this success, enabling strong prompt adherence and realistic video quality. Despite their versatility and superior performance, these models require intensive computation. Each video generation requires dozens of iterative steps, and CFG doubles the required compute. This inefficiency hinders broader adoption in downstream applications. We introduce GalaxyDiT, a training-free method to accelerate video generation with guidance alignment and systematic proxy selection for reuse metrics. Through rank-order correlation analysis, our technique identifies the optimal proxy for each video model, across model families and parameter scales, thereby ensuring optimal computational reuse. We achieve $1.87\times$ and $2.37\times$ speedup on Wan2.1-1.3B and Wan2.1-14B with only 0.97% and 0.72% drops on the VBench-2.0 benchmark. At high speedup rates, our approach maintains superior fidelity to the base model, exceeding prior state-of-the-art approaches by 5 to 10 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of LoVoRA. https://cz-5f.github.io/LoVoRA.github.io</p></details> |  |

Investigating Audio-Video Joint Denoising for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02457v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://jianzongwu.github.io/projects/does-hearing-help-seeing/</p></details> |

However, existing research predominantly focuses on coarse spatiotemporal scales and relies on low-resolution satellite data, capturing only macroscopic fire states while fundamentally constraining high-precision localized fire dynamics modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present FireSentry, a provincial-scale multi-modal wildfire dataset characterized by sub-meter spatial and sub-second temporal resolution. Collected using synchronized UAV platforms, FireSentry provides visible and infrared video streams, in-situ environmental measurements, and manually validated fire masks. Building on FireSentry, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing physics-based, data-driven, and generative models, revealing the limitations of existing mask-only approaches. Our analysis proposes FiReDiff, a novel dual-modality paradigm that first predicts future video sequences in the infrared modality, and then precisely segments fire masks in the mask modality based on the generated dynamics. FiReDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, with video quality gains of 39.2% in PSNR, 36.1% in SSIM, 50.0% in LPIPS, 29.4% in FVD, and mask accuracy gains of 3.3% in AUPRC, 59.1% in F1 score, 42.9% in IoU, and 62.5% in MSE when applied to generative models. The FireSentry benchmark dataset and FiReDiff paradigm collectively advance fine-grained wildfire forecasting and dynamic disaster simulation.

Most visual understanding, prediction, and generation operate directly on 2D observations, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose SeeU, a novel approach that learns the continuous 4D dynamics and generate the unseen visual contents. The principle behind SeeU is a new 2D$\to$4D$\to$2D learning framework. SeeU first reconstructs the 4D world from sparse and monocular 2D frames (2D$\to$4D). It then learns the continuous 4D dynamics on a low-rank representation and physical constraints (discrete 4D$\to$continuous 4D). Finally, SeeU rolls the world forward in time, re-projects it back to 2D at sampled times and viewpoints, and generates unseen regions based on spatial-temporal context awareness (4D$\to$2D). By modeling dynamics in 4D, SeeU achieves continuous and physically-consistent novel visual generation, demonstrating strong potentials in multiple tasks including unseen temporal generation, unseen spatial generation, and video editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yuyuanspace.com/SeeU/</p></details> |
| **[Generative Action Tell-Tales: Assessing Human Motion in Synthesized Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01803v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in video generative models, robust metrics for evaluating visual and temporal correctness of complex human actions remain elusive. Critically, existing pure-vision encoders and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are strongly appearance-biased, lack temporal understanding, and thus struggle to discern intricate motion dynamics and anatomical implausibilities in generated videos. We tackle this gap by introducing a novel evaluation metric derived from a learned latent space of real-world human actions. Our method first captures the nuances, constraints, and temporal smoothness of real-world motion by fusing appearance-agnostic human skeletal geometry features with appearance-based features. We posit that this combined feature space provides a robust representation of action plausibility. Given a generated video, our metric quantifies its action quality by measuring the distance between its underlying representations and this learned real-world action distribution. For rigorous validation, we develop a new multi-faceted benchmark specifically designed to probe temporally challenging aspects of human action fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our metric achieves substantial improvement of more than 68% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, performs competitively on established external benchmarks, and has a stronger correlation with human perception. Our in-depth analysis reveals critical limitations in current video generative models and establishes a new standard for advanced research in video generation.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images. Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene. Both shot count and duration are flexibly configurable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and outstanding controllability of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://qinghew.github.io/MultiShotMaster</p></details> |

To this end, we present Video4Spatial, a framework showing that video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context can perform complex spatial tasks. We validate on two tasks: scene navigation - following camera-pose instructions while remaining consistent with 3D geometry of the scene, and object grounding - which requires semantic localization, instruction following, and planning. Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments. Taken together, these results advance video generative models toward general visuospatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://xizaoqu.github.io/video4spatial/</p></details> |

Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project website is https://carlyx.github.io/MAViD/</p></details> |

This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sagipolaczek.github.io/Sync-LoRA/</p></details> |

However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in WACV 2026 - Applications Track</p></details> |

Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices. Our study deepens the understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offers principles for guiding future architectural and algorithmic improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version; 15 pages, 16 figures</p></details> |

Although there are have been numerous methods developed for detecting data contamination in large language models (LLMs), their performance on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) falls short due to the instabilities introduced through multimodal component adaptation and possible distribution shifts across multiple inputs. In this work, we investigate multimodal membership inference and address two issues: first, by identifying distribution shifts in the existing datasets, and second, by releasing an extended baseline pipeline to detect them. We also generalize the perturbation-based membership inference methods to MLLMs and release \textbf{FiMMIA} -- a modular \textbf{F}ramework for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{MIA}.\footnote{The source code and framework have been made publicly available under the MIT license via \href{https://github.com/ai-forever/data_leakage_detect}{link}.The video demonstration is available on \href{https://youtu.be/a9L4-H80aSg}{YouTube}.} Our approach trains a neural network to analyze the target model's behavior on perturbed inputs, capturing distributional differences between members and non-members.

The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 15 figures.

Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.</p></details> |  |

However, existing construction methods either depend on labor-intensive expert reasoning or on fully automated systems lacking expert involvement, creating a tension between scalability and interpretability. We introduce \textbf{XISM}, an interactive system that combines data-driven inference with expert knowledge. XISM generates candidate maps via a top-down procedure and allows users to iteratively refine edges in a visual interface, with real-time metric feedback.

| **[Hear What Matters! Text-conditioned Selective Video-to-Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02650v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Code and demo are available at https://jnwnlee.github.io/selva-demo/.</p></details> |  |
| **[RULER-Bench: Probing Rule-based Reasoning Abilities of Next-level Video Generation Models for Vision Foundation Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02622v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-speech Gesture Video Generation via Motion-Based Graph Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02576v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniPerson: Unified Identity-Preserving Pedestrian Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02554v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.</p></details> |  |

We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

During generation, TempoMaster employs bidirectional attention within each frame-rate level while performing autoregression across frame rates, thus achieving long-range temporal coherence while enabling efficient and parallel synthesis.

Existing end-to-end models often struggle with this temporal hierarchy, offering solutions that lack generalization, incur high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a foundational framework for sports video understanding. In our system, each agent functions as a distinct "cognitive tool" specializing in a specific aspect of analysis. The system's architecture is not confined to a single temporal dimension or task. By leveraging iterative invocation and flexible composition of these agents, our framework can construct adaptive pipelines for both short-term analytic reasoning (e.g., Rally QA) and long-term generative summarization (e.g., match summaries). We demonstrate the adaptability of this framework using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showcasing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization. This work presents a paradigm shift towards a flexible, scalable, and interpretable system for robust, cross-task sports video intelligence.

Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.</p></details> |  |

While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion φ-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. φ-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, φ-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, φ-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation. Videos, additional examples, and code are available on our \href{https://yuzeng-at-tri.github.io/ppd-page/}{project page}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations of Diffusion Models in General State Spaces: A Self-Contained Introduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05092v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion models now occupy a central place in generative modeling, introductory treatments commonly assume Euclidean data and seldom clarify their connection to discrete-state analogues. This article is a self-contained primer on diffusion over general state spaces, unifying continuous domains and discrete/categorical structures under one lens. We develop the discrete-time view (forward noising via Markov kernels and learned reverse dynamics) alongside its continuous-time limits -- stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) on finite alphabets -- and derive the associated Fokker--Planck and master equations. A common variational treatment yields the ELBO that underpins standard training losses. We make explicit how forward corruption choices -- Gaussian processes in continuous spaces and structured categorical transition kernels (uniform, masking/absorbing and more) in discrete spaces -- shape reverse dynamics and the ELBO. The presentation is layered for three audiences: newcomers seeking a self-contained intuitive introduction; diffusion practitioners wanting a global theoretical synthesis; and continuous-diffusion experts looking for an analogy-first path into discrete diffusion. The result is a unified roadmap to modern diffusion methodology across continuous domains and discrete sequences, highlighting a compact set of reusable proofs, identities, and core theoretical principles.</p></details> |  |

| **[Generative Neural Video Compression via Video Diffusion Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05016v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GNVC-VD, the first DiT-based generative neural video compression framework built upon an advanced video generation foundation model, where spatio-temporal latent compression and sequence-level generative refinement are unified within a single codec. Existing perceptual codecs primarily rely on pre-trained image generative priors to restore high-frequency details, but their frame-wise nature lacks temporal modeling and inevitably leads to perceptual flickering. To address this, GNVC-VD introduces a unified flow-matching latent refinement module that leverages a video diffusion transformer to jointly enhance intra- and inter-frame latents through sequence-level denoising, ensuring consistent spatio-temporal details. Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian noise as in video generation, GNVC-VD initializes refinement from decoded spatio-temporal latents and learns a correction term that adapts the diffusion prior to compression-induced degradation. A conditioning adaptor further injects compression-aware cues into intermediate DiT layers, enabling effective artifact removal while maintaining temporal coherence under extreme bitrate constraints. Extensive experiments show that GNVC-VD surpasses both traditional and learned codecs in perceptual quality and significantly reduces the flickering artifacts that persist in prior generative approaches, even below 0.01 bpp, highlighting the promise of integrating video-native generative priors into neural codecs for next-generation perceptual video compression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reflection Removal through Efficient Adaptation of Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05000v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a diffusion-transformer (DiT) framework for single-image reflection removal that leverages the generalization strengths of foundation diffusion models in the restoration setting. Rather than relying on task-specific architectures, we repurpose a pre-trained DiT-based foundation model by conditioning it on reflection-contaminated inputs and guiding it toward clean transmission layers. We systematically analyze existing reflection removal data sources for diversity, scalability, and photorealism. To address the shortage of suitable data, we construct a physically based rendering (PBR) pipeline in Blender, built around the Principled BSDF, to synthesize realistic glass materials and reflection effects. Efficient LoRA-based adaptation of the foundation model, combined with the proposed synthetic data, achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks. These results demonstrate that pretrained diffusion transformers, when paired with physically grounded data synthesis and efficient adaptation, offer a scalable and high-fidelity solution for reflection removal.

| **[Towards a unified framework for guided diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04985v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guided or controlled data generation with diffusion models\blfootnote{Partial preliminary results of this work appeared in International Conference on Machine Learning 2025 \citep{li2025provable}.} has become a cornerstone of modern generative modeling. Despite substantial advances in diffusion model theory, the theoretical understanding of guided diffusion samplers remains severely limited. We make progress by developing a unified algorithmic and theoretical framework that accommodates both diffusion guidance and reward-guided diffusion. Aimed at fine-tuning diffusion models to improve certain rewards, we propose injecting a reward guidance term -- constructed from the difference between the original and reward-reweighted scores -- into the backward diffusion process, and rigorously quantify the resulting reward improvement over the unguided counterpart. As a key application, our framework shows that classifier-free guidance (CFG) decreases the expected reciprocal of the classifier probability, providing the first theoretical characterization of the specific performance metric that CFG improves for general target distributions. When applied to reward-guided diffusion, our framework yields a new sampler that is easy-to-train and requires no full diffusion trajectories during training. Numerical experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Hybrid-Diffusion models that combine open-loop routines with visuomotor diffusion policies. We develop Teleoperation Augmentation Primitives (TAPs) that allow the operator to perform predefined routines, such as locking specific axes, moving to perching waypoints, or triggering task-specific routines seamlessly during demonstrations. Our Hybrid-Diffusion method learns to trigger such TAPs during inference. We validate the method on challenging real-world tasks: Vial Aspiration, Open-Container Liquid Transfer, and container unscrewing.

| **[Semantics Lead the Way: Harmonizing Semantic and Texture Modeling with Asynchronous Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04926v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) inherently follow a coarse-to-fine generation process, where high-level semantic structure is generated slightly earlier than fine-grained texture. This indicates the preceding semantics potentially benefit texture generation by providing a semantic anchor. Recent advances have integrated semantic priors from pretrained visual encoders to further enhance LDMs, yet they still denoise semantic and VAE-encoded texture synchronously, neglecting such ordering. Observing these, we propose Semantic-First Diffusion (SFD), a latent diffusion paradigm that explicitly prioritizes semantic formation. SFD first constructs composite latents by combining a compact semantic latent, which is extracted from a pretrained visual encoder via a dedicated Semantic VAE, with the texture latent. The core of SFD is to denoise the semantic and texture latents asynchronously using separate noise schedules: semantics precede textures by a temporal offset, providing clearer high-level guidance for texture refinement and enabling natural coarse-to-fine generation. On ImageNet 256x256 with guidance, SFD achieves FID 1.06 (LightningDiT-XL) and FID 1.04 (1.0B LightningDiT-XXL), while achieving up to 100x faster convergence than the original DiT. SFD also improves existing methods like ReDi and VA-VAE, demonstrating the effectiveness of asynchronous, semantics-led modeling.

Where $ε$-machines capture the predictive temporal structure and intrinsic computation of ABM-generated time series, diffusion models characterize high-dimensional cross-sectional distributions, learn underlying data manifolds, and enable synthetic generation of plausible population-level outcomes. We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -- processes vs. distributions -- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation. The framework is validated using the same elder-caregiver ABM dataset introduced in the companion paper, and we provide precise definitions and propositions formalizing the mathematical complementarity between $ε$-machines and diffusion models. This establishes a principled methodology for jointly analyzing temporal predictability and high-dimensional distributional structure in complex simulation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

Its reliability is limited by noise and decorrelation in radar acquisitions, which makes accurate reconstruction of the deformation signal challenging. We propose a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)-based framework for InSAR phase unwrapping, UnwrapDiff, in which the output of the traditional minimum cost flow algorithm (SNAPHU) is incorporated as conditional guidance. To evaluate robustness, we construct a synthetic dataset that incorporates atmospheric effects and diverse noise patterns, representative of realistic InSAR observations. Experiments show that the proposed model leverages the conditional prior while reducing the effect of diverse noise patterns, achieving on average a 10.11\% reduction in NRMSE compared to SNAPHU. It also achieves better reconstruction quality in difficult cases such as dyke intrusions.</p></details> |  |

Most existing ASSR approaches rely on implicit neural representation (INR), but its regression-driven feature extraction and aggregation intrinsically limit the ability to synthesize fine details, leading to low realism. Recent diffusion-based realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models leverage powerful pre-trained diffusion priors and show impressive results at the 4x setting. We observe that they can also achieve ASSR because the diffusion prior implicitly adapts to scale by encouraging high-realism generation. However, without explicit scale control, the diffusion process cannot be properly adjusted for different magnification levels, resulting in excessive hallucination or blurry outputs, especially under ultra-high scales. To address these issues, we propose OmniScaleSR, a diffusion-based realistic arbitrary-scale SR framework designed to achieve both high fidelity and high realism. We introduce explicit, diffusion-native scale control mechanisms that work synergistically with implicit scale adaptation, enabling scale-aware and content-aware modulation of the diffusion process. In addition, we incorporate multi-domain fidelity enhancement designs to further improve reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on bicubic degradation benchmarks and real-world datasets show that OmniScaleSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and perceptual realism, with particularly strong performance at large magnification factors. Code will be released at https://github.com/chaixinning/OmniScaleSR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as TCSVT, 15 pages</p></details> |

To better understand how they encode spatiotemporal information, we analyze the internal representations of Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT). Our analysis reveals that attention heads act as minimal functional units with distinct specializations for matching, semantic understanding, and positional encoding. Additionally, we find that the low-frequency components in VDiT features are crucial for establishing correspondences, whereas the high-frequency components tend to introduce noise. Building on these insights, we propose a head- and frequency-aware feature selection strategy that jointly selects the most informative attention head and low-frequency components to enhance tracking performance. Specifically, our method extracts discriminative features through single-step denoising, applies feature selection, and employs soft-argmax localization with forward-backward consistency checks for correspondence estimation. Extensive experiments on TAP-Vid benchmarks demonstrate that HeFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot tracking performance, approaching the accuracy of supervised methods while eliminating the need for annotated training data. Our work further underscores the promise of video diffusion models as powerful foundation models for a wide range of downstream tasks, paving the way toward unified visual foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, prevalent approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), heavily rely on constructing explicit user--service interaction graphs. This dependency introduces severe scalability bottlenecks and limits performance when explicit connections are sparse or corrupted by noise. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism. This adversarial paradigm dynamically distinguishes informative patterns from noise, enabling a dual-perspective modeling of intricate user--service associations. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that QoSDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the results highlight the framework's superior cross-dataset generalization capability and exceptional robustness against data sparsity and observational noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to IEEE Transactions on Services Computing</p></details> |

Existing fine-tuning methods for diffusion models significantly suffer from reward over-optimization, resulting in high-reward but unnatural samples and degraded diversity. To mitigate over-optimization, we propose \textbf{Soft Q-based Diffusion Finetuning (SQDF)}, a novel KL-regularized RL method for diffusion alignment that applies a reparameterized policy gradient of a training-free, differentiable estimation of the soft Q-function. SQDF is further enhanced with three innovations: a discount factor for proper credit assignment in the denoising process, the integration of consistency models to refine Q-function estimates, and the use of an off-policy replay buffer to improve mode coverage and manage the reward-diversity trade-off. Our experiments demonstrate that SQDF achieves superior target rewards while preserving diversity in text-to-image alignment.

While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present UltraImage, a principled framework that addresses both issues. Through frequency-wise analysis of positional embeddings, we identify that repetition arises from the periodicity of the dominant frequency, whose period aligns with the training resolution. We introduce a recursive dominant frequency correction to constrain it within a single period after extrapolation. Furthermore, we find that quality degradation stems from diluted attention and thus propose entropy-guided adaptive attention concentration, which assigns higher focus factors to sharpen local attention for fine detail and lower ones to global attention patterns to preserve structural consistency. Experiments show that UltraImage consistently outperforms prior methods on Qwen-Image and Flux (around 4K) across three generation scenarios, reducing repetition and improving visual fidelity. Moreover, UltraImage can generate images up to 6K*6K without low-resolution guidance from a training resolution of 1328p, demonstrating its extreme extrapolation capability.

Task-oriented diffusion models have significantly advanced action-to-motion, text-to-motion, and audio-to-motion applications. In this paper, we investigate fundamental questions regarding motion representations and loss functions in a controlled study, and we enumerate the impacts of various decisions in the workflow of the generative motion diffusion model. To answer these questions, we conduct empirical studies based on a proxy motion diffusion model (MDM). We apply v loss as the prediction objective on MDM (vMDM), where v is the weighted sum of motion data and noise. We aim to enhance the understanding of latent data distributions and provide a foundation for improving the state of conditional motion diffusion models. First, we evaluate the six common motion representations in the literature and compare their performance in terms of quality and diversity metrics. Second, we compare the training time under various configurations to shed light on how to speed up the training process of motion diffusion models. Finally, we also conduct evaluation analysis on a large motion dataset. The results of our experiments indicate clear performance differences across motion representations in diverse datasets. Our results also demonstrate the impacts of distinct configurations on model training and suggest the importance and effectiveness of these decisions on the outcomes of motion diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[dVLM-AD: Enhance Diffusion Vision-Language-Model for Driving via Controllable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04459v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomous driving community is increasingly focused on addressing the challenges posed by out-of-distribution (OOD) driving scenarios. A dominant research trend seeks to enhance end-to-end (E2E) driving systems by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), leveraging their rich world knowledge and reasoning abilities to improve generalization across diverse environments. However, most existing VLMs or vision-language agents (VLAs) are built upon autoregressive (AR) models. In this paper, we observe that existing AR-based VLMs -- limited by causal attention and sequential token generation -- often fail to maintain consistency and controllability between high-level reasoning and low-level planning. In contrast, recent discrete diffusion VLMs equipped with bidirectional attention exhibit superior controllability and reliability through iterative denoising. Building on these observations, we introduce dVLM-AD, a diffusion-based vision-language model that unifies perception, structured reasoning, and low-level planning for end-to-end driving. Evaluated on nuScenes and WOD-E2E, dVLM-AD yields more consistent reasoning-action pairs and achieves planning performance comparable to existing driving VLM/VLA systems despite a modest backbone, outperforming AR-based baselines with a 9 percent improvement in behavior-trajectory consistency and a 6 percent increase in RFS on long-tail WOD-E2E scenarios. These results suggest a controllable and reliable pathway for scalable end-to-end driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[GuidNoise: Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for Generalized Noise Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04456v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image denoising methods have leveraged generative modeling for real noise synthesis to address the costly acquisition of real-world noisy data. However, these generative models typically require camera metadata and extensive target-specific noisy-clean image pairs, often showing limited generalization between settings. In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data.

Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zero4dvid.github.io/</p></details> |

Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-regularized Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Models at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04332v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative diffusion models with human preferences via reinforcement learning (RL) is critical yet challenging. Most existing algorithms are often vulnerable to reward hacking, such as quality degradation, over-stylization, or reduced diversity. Our analysis demonstrates that this can be attributed to the inherent limitations of their regularization, which provides unreliable penalties. We introduce Data-regularized Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (DDRL), a novel framework that uses the forward KL divergence to anchor the policy to an off-policy data distribution. Theoretically, DDRL enables robust, unbiased integration of RL with standard diffusion training. Empirically, this translates into a simple yet effective algorithm that combines reward maximization with diffusion loss minimization. With over a million GPU hours of experiments and ten thousand double-blind human evaluations, we demonstrate on high-resolution video generation tasks that DDRL significantly improves rewards while alleviating the reward hacking seen in baselines, achieving the highest human preference and establishing a robust and scalable paradigm for diffusion post-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Asymptotic Convergence of Discrete Diffusion Models: Masked and Random Walk dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00580v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models for continuous state spaces based on Gaussian noising processes are now relatively well understood, as many works have focused on their theoretical analysis. In contrast, results for diffusion models on discrete state spaces remain limited and pose significant challenges, particularly due to their combinatorial structure and their more recent introduction in generative modelling. In this work, we establish new and sharp convergence guarantees for three popular discrete diffusion models (DDMs). Two of these models are designed for finite state spaces and are based respectively on the random walk and the masking process. The third DDM we consider is defined on the countably infinite space $\mathbb{N}^d$ and uses a drifted random walk as its forward process. For each of these models, the backward process can be characterized by a discrete score function that can, in principle, be estimated. However, even with perfect access to these scores, simulating the exact backward process is infeasible, and one must rely on approximations. In this work, we study Euler-type approximations and establish convergence bounds in both Kullback-Leibler divergence and total variation distance for the resulting models, under minimal assumptions on the data distribution. In particular, we show that the computational complexity of each method scales linearly in the dimension, up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for these noising processes that do not rely on boundedness assumptions on the estimated score.</p></details> |  |
| **[MVRoom: Controllable 3D Indoor Scene Generation with Multi-View Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04248v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MVRoom, a controllable novel view synthesis (NVS) pipeline for 3D indoor scenes that uses multi-view diffusion conditioned on a coarse 3D layout. MVRoom employs a two-stage design in which the 3D layout is used throughout to enforce multi-view consistency. The first stage employs novel representations to effectively bridge the 3D layout and consistent image-based condition signals for multi-view generation. The second stage performs image-conditioned multi-view generation, incorporating a layout-aware epipolar attention mechanism to enhance multi-view consistency during the diffusion process. Additionally, we introduce an iterative framework that generates 3D scenes with varying numbers of objects and scene complexities by recursively performing multi-view generation (MVRoom), supporting text-to-scene generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high-fidelity and controllable 3D scene generation for NVS, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components within our generation pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDPose: Exploiting Diffusion Priors for Out-of-Domain and Robust Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24980v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as Marigold and Lotus adapt diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization, their potential for structured outputs remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose SDPose, a fine-tuning framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate robustness under domain shift, we further construct COCO-OOD, a style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD. Extensive ablations highlight the importance of diffusion priors, RGB reconstruction, and multi-scale SD U-Net features for cross-domain generalization, and t-SNE analyses further explain SD's domain-invariant latent structure. We also show that SDPose serves as an effective zero-shot pose annotator for controllable image and video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods face two key limitations: (1) reliance on costly auxiliary features (e.g., Points of Interest, socioeconomic statistics) with limited spatial coverage, and (2) fragility to spatial topology changes, where reordering urban regions disrupts the structural coherence of generated flows. We propose Sat2Flow, a structure-aware diffusion framework that generates structurally coherent OD flows using only satellite imagery. Our approach employs a multi-kernel encoder to capture diverse regional interactions and a permutation-aware diffusion process that maintains consistency across regional orderings. Through joint contrastive training linking satellite features with OD patterns and equivariant diffusion training enforcing structural invariance, Sat2Flow ensures topological robustness under arbitrary regional reindexing. Experiments on real-world datasets show that Sat2Flow outperforms physics-based and data-driven baselines in accuracy while preserving flow distributions and spatial structures under index permutations. Sat2Flow offers a globally scalable solution for OD flow generation in data-scarce environments, eliminating region-specific auxiliary data dependencies while maintaining structural robustness for reliable mobility modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Highly Efficient Test-Time Scaling for T2I Diffusion Models with Text Embedding Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03996v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling (TTS) aims to achieve better results by increasing random sampling and evaluating samples based on rules and metrics. However, in text-to-image(T2I) diffusion models, most related works focus on search strategies and reward models, yet the impact of the stochastic characteristic of noise in T2I diffusion models on the method's performance remains unexplored. In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation. Concurrently, text embedding demonstrates varying levels of tolerance to perturbation across different dimensions of the generation process. Specifically, our method consists of two key designs: (1) Introducing step-based text embedding perturbation, combining frequency-guided noise schedules with spatial noise perturbation. (2) Adapting the perturbation intensity selectively based on their frequency-specific contributions to generation and tolerance to perturbation. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTS methods and demonstrates significant improvements on multiple benchmarks with almost no additional computation.

| **[BlurDM: A Blur Diffusion Model for Image Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03979v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models show promise for dynamic scene deblurring; however, existing studies often fail to leverage the intrinsic nature of the blurring process within diffusion models, limiting their full potential. To address it, we present a Blur Diffusion Model (BlurDM), which seamlessly integrates the blur formation process into diffusion for image deblurring. Observing that motion blur stems from continuous exposure, BlurDM implicitly models the blur formation process through a dual-diffusion forward scheme, diffusing both noise and blur onto a sharp image. During the reverse generation process, we derive a dual denoising and deblurring formulation, enabling BlurDM to recover the sharp image by simultaneously denoising and deblurring, given pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred image as input. Additionally, to efficiently integrate BlurDM into deblurring networks, we perform BlurDM in the latent space, forming a flexible prior generation network for deblurring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlurDM significantly and consistently enhances existing deblurring methods on four benchmark datasets.

| **[CoDA: From Text-to-Image Diffusion Models to Training-Free Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03844v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing Dataset Distillation (DD) methods leveraging generative models confront two fundamental limitations. First, despite pioneering the use of diffusion models in DD and delivering impressive performance, the vast majority of approaches paradoxically require a diffusion model pre-trained on the full target dataset, undermining the very purpose of DD and incurring prohibitive training costs. Second, although some methods turn to general text-to-image models without relying on such target-specific training, they suffer from a significant distributional mismatch, as the web-scale priors encapsulated in these foundation models fail to faithfully capture the target-specific semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Core Distribution Alignment (CoDA), a framework that enables effective DD using only an off-the-shelf text-to-image model. Our key idea is to first identify the "intrinsic core distribution" of the target dataset using a robust density-based discovery mechanism. We then steer the generative process to align the generated samples with this core distribution. By doing so, CoDA effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose generative priors and target semantics, yielding highly representative distilled datasets. Extensive experiments suggest that, without relying on a generative model specifically trained on the target dataset, CoDA achieves performance on par with or even superior to previous methods with such reliance across all benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K and its subsets. Notably, it establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.4% at the 50-images-per-class (IPC) setup on ImageNet-1K.

| **[Decoding Large Language Diffusion Models with Foreseeing Movement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04135v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) benefit from a flexible decoding mechanism that enables parallelized inference and controllable generations over autoregressive models. Yet such flexibility introduces a critical challenge: inference performance becomes highly sensitive to the decoding order of tokens. Existing heuristic methods, however, focus mainly on local effects while overlooking long-term impacts. To address this limitation, we propose the Foreseeing Decoding Method (FDM), a novel approach that integrates both local and global considerations to unlock the full potential, employing a search-based strategy to enable effective optimization in discrete spaces. Furthermore, by analyzing the consistency of chosen tokens in the full decoding process, we develop a variant, FDM with Acceleration (FDM-A), which restricts deep exploration to critical steps identified as the exploration and balance circumantences. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures validate the scalability of FDM and demonstrate the superior efficiency-performance trade-off achieved by FDM-A. Our work might potentially provide a principled step toward more powerful decoding methods for LLDMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Principled RL for Diffusion LLMs Emerges from a Sequence-Level Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03759v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective for autoregressive language models, but adapting these methods to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) presents fundamental challenges. The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning tasks demonstrate that ESPO significantly outperforms token-level baselines, achieving dramatic improvements of 20-40 points on the Countdown task, while maintaining consistent gains on math and coding benchmarks. Our approach establishes sequence-level optimization as a principled and empirically effective paradigm for RL in dLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/ESPO.</p></details> |  |

These models are trained on large-scale datasets, like LAION-5B, often scraped from the internet. However, since this data contains numerous biases, the models inherently learn and reproduce them, resulting in stereotypical outputs. We introduce SelfDebias, a fully unsupervised test-time debiasing method applicable to any diffusion model that uses a UNet as its noise predictor. SelfDebias identifies semantic clusters in an image encoder's embedding space and uses these clusters to guide the diffusion process during inference, minimizing the KL divergence between the output distribution and the uniform distribution. Unlike supervised approaches, SelfDebias does not require human-annotated datasets or external classifiers trained for each generated concept. Instead, it is designed to automatically identify semantic modes. Extensive experiments show that SelfDebias generalizes across prompts and diffusion model architectures, including both conditional and unconditional models. It not only effectively debiases images along key demographic dimensions while maintaining the visual fidelity of the generated images, but also more abstract concepts for which identifying biases is also challenging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2026</p></details> |

However, as model size increases, the growing memory footprint and inference latency pose significant challenges for practical deployment. Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. Building on this, we design ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module that integrates rotation, quantization, GEMM, and dequantization, enabling W4A4 inference without retraining and preserving visual quality. Experiments on FLUX.1-dev demonstrate a 2.26$\times$ speedup and 4.05$\times$ memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity. To our knowledge, this is the first application of rotation-based quantization for plug-and-play W4A4 inference in diffusion transformers.</p></details> |  |

We introduce universal MDT (UMDT), a generalization of MDT that seeks to translate between any pair of $K$ domains using only $K-1$ paired datasets with a central domain. To tackle this problem, we propose Diffusion Router (DR), a unified diffusion-based framework that models all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations with a single noise predictor conditioned on the source and target domain labels. DR enables indirect non-central translations by routing through the central domain. We further introduce a novel scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound objective and an efficient Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct non-central mappings. Through evaluation on three large-scale UMDT benchmarks, DR achieves state-of-the-art results for both indirect and direct translations, while lowering sampling cost and unlocking novel tasks such as sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. These results establish DR as a scalable and versatile framework for universal translation across multiple domains.</p></details> |  |

PipeFusion partitions images into patches and the model layers across multiple GPUs. It employs a patch-level pipeline parallel strategy to orchestrate communication and computation efficiently. By capitalizing on the high similarity between inputs from successive diffusion steps, PipeFusion reuses one-step stale feature maps to provide context for the current pipeline step. This approach notably reduces communication costs compared to existing DiTs inference parallelism, including tensor parallel, sequence parallel and DistriFusion. PipeFusion enhances memory efficiency through parameter distribution across devices, ideal for large DiTs like Flux.1. Experimental results demonstrate that PipeFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8$\times$L40 PCIe GPUs for Pixart, Stable-Diffusion 3, and Flux.1 models.

We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100% navigation success and 0.09s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for publication and is currently under review</p></details> |

To address the significant gap between textual descriptions and 3D articulated object representations, we propose GAOT, a three-phase framework that generates articulated objects from text prompts, leveraging diffusion models and hypergraph learning in a three-step process. First, we fine-tune a point cloud generation model to produce a coarse representation of objects from text prompts. Given the inherent connection between articulated objects and graph structures, we design a hypergraph-based learning method to refine these coarse representations, representing object parts as graph vertices. Finally, leveraging a diffusion model, the joints of articulated objects-represented as graph edges-are generated based on the object parts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the PartNet-Mobility dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior performance over previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM Asia2026</p></details> |
| **[Towards Irreversible Machine Unlearning for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03564v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are renowned for their state-of-the-art performance in generating synthetic images. However, concerns related to safety, privacy, and copyright highlight the need for machine unlearning, which can make diffusion models forget specific training data and prevent the generation of sensitive or unwanted content. Current machine unlearning methods for diffusion models are primarily designed for conditional diffusion models and focus on unlearning specific data classes or features. Among these methods, finetuning-based machine unlearning methods are recognized for their efficiency and effectiveness, which update the parameters of pre-trained diffusion models by minimizing carefully designed loss functions. However, in this paper, we propose a novel attack named Diffusion Model Relearning Attack (DiMRA), which can reverse the finetuning-based machine unlearning methods, posing a significant vulnerability of this kind of technique. Without prior knowledge of the unlearning elements, DiMRA optimizes the unlearned diffusion model on an auxiliary dataset to reverse the unlearning, enabling the model to regenerate previously unlearned elements. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel machine unlearning method for diffusion models, termed as Diffusion Model Unlearning by Memorization (DiMUM). Unlike traditional methods that focus on forgetting, DiMUM memorizes alternative data or features to replace targeted unlearning data or features in order to prevent generating such elements. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMRA in reversing state-of-the-art finetuning-based machine unlearning methods for diffusion models, highlighting the need for more robust solutions. We extensively evaluate DiMUM, demonstrating its superior ability to preserve the generative performance of diffusion models while enhancing robustness against DiMRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[FloodDiffusion: Tailored Diffusion Forcing for Streaming Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03520v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present FloodDiffusion, a new framework for text-driven, streaming human motion generation. Given time-varying text prompts, FloodDiffusion generates text-aligned, seamless motion sequences with real-time latency. Unlike existing methods that rely on chunk-by-chunk or auto-regressive model with diffusion head, we adopt a diffusion forcing framework to model this time-series generation task under time-varying control events. We find that a straightforward implementation of vanilla diffusion forcing (as proposed for video models) fails to model real motion distributions. We demonstrate that to guarantee modeling the output distribution, the vanilla diffusion forcing must be tailored to: (i) train with a bi-directional attention instead of casual attention; (ii) implement a lower triangular time scheduler instead of a random one; (iii) utilize a continues time-varying way to introduce text conditioning. With these improvements, we demonstrate in the first time that the diffusion forcing-based framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the streaming motion generation task, reaching an FID of 0.057 on the HumanML3D benchmark. Models, code, and weights are available. https://shandaai.github.io/FloodDiffusion/</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Margin-aware Preference Optimization for Aligning Diffusion Models without Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06424v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern preference alignment methods, such as DPO, rely on divergence regularization to a reference model for training stability-but this creates a fundamental problem we call "reference mismatch." In this paper, we investigate the negative impacts of reference mismatch in aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, showing that larger reference mismatch hinders effective adaptation given the same amount of data, e.g., as when learning new artistic styles, or personalizing to specific objects. We demonstrate this phenomenon across text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and introduce margin-aware preference optimization (MaPO), a reference-agnostic approach that breaks free from this constraint. By directly optimizing the likelihood margin between preferred and dispreferred outputs under the Bradley-Terry model without anchoring to a reference, MaPO transforms diverse T2I tasks into unified pairwise preference optimization. We validate MaPO's versatility across five challenging domains: (1) safe generation, (2) style adaptation, (3) cultural representation, (4) personalization, and (5) general preference alignment. Our results reveal that MaPO's advantage grows dramatically with reference mismatch severity, outperforming both DPO and specialized methods like DreamBooth while reducing training time by 15%. MaPO thus emerges as a versatile and memory-efficient method for generic T2I adaptation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 Main Technical Track</p></details> |

Transformer-based architectures (DiTs) and classifier-free guidance (CFG) are two cornerstones of this success, enabling strong prompt adherence and realistic video quality. Despite their versatility and superior performance, these models require intensive computation. Each video generation requires dozens of iterative steps, and CFG doubles the required compute. This inefficiency hinders broader adoption in downstream applications. We introduce GalaxyDiT, a training-free method to accelerate video generation with guidance alignment and systematic proxy selection for reuse metrics. Through rank-order correlation analysis, our technique identifies the optimal proxy for each video model, across model families and parameter scales, thereby ensuring optimal computational reuse. We achieve $1.87\times$ and $2.37\times$ speedup on Wan2.1-1.3B and Wan2.1-14B with only 0.97% and 0.72% drops on the VBench-2.0 benchmark. At high speedup rates, our approach maintains superior fidelity to the base model, exceeding prior state-of-the-art approaches by 5 to 10 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).</p></details> |  |

Most existing unsupervised keypoint methods are not designed for unconditional generative settings, restricting their use in modern 3D generative pipelines; our formulation explicitly bridges this gap. We present an unsupervised framework for learning spatially structured 3D keypoints from point cloud data. These keypoints serve as a compact and interpretable representation that conditions an Elucidated Diffusion Model (EDM) to reconstruct the full shape. The learned keypoints exhibit repeatable spatial structure across object instances and support smooth interpolation in keypoint space, indicating that they capture geometric variation. Our method achieves strong performance across diverse object categories, yielding a 6 percentage-point improvement in keypoint consistency compared to prior approaches.</p></details> |  |

We present a label-efficient framework that leverages spatial features from a frozen diffusion model pretrained on natural images. Our approach extracts low-level representations from high-resolution decoder layers at early denoising timesteps, which transfer effectively to the low-texture structure of HSI. To integrate spectral and spatial information, we introduce a lightweight FiLM-based fusion module that adaptively modulates frozen spatial features using spectral cues, enabling robust multimodal learning under sparse supervision. Experiments on two recent hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using only the provided sparse training labels. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of diffusion-derived features and spectral-aware fusion. Overall, our results indicate that pretrained diffusion models can support domain-agnostic, label-efficient representation learning for remote sensing and broader scientific imaging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ICML 2025 TerraBytes Workshop (June 9, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Diffusion Model Framework for Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02019v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in data-driven learning and in sampling from complex, unnormalized target distributions. Building on this progress, we reinterpret Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntRL) as a diffusion model-based sampling problem. We tackle this problem by minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion policy and the optimal policy distribution using a tractable upper bound. By applying the policy gradient theorem to this objective, we derive a modified surrogate objective for MaxEntRL that incorporates diffusion dynamics in a principled way. This leads to simple diffusion-based variants of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), termed DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO. All of these methods require only minor implementation changes to their base algorithm. We find that on standard continuous control benchmarks, DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO achieve better returns and higher sample efficiency than SAC and PPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystify Protein Generation with Hierarchical Conditional Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18603v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks. However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models. Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels, resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models. Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.</p></details> |  |
| **[NavMapFusion: Diffusion-based Fusion of Navigation Maps for Online Vectorized HD Map Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03317v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate environmental representations are essential for autonomous driving, providing the foundation for safe and efficient navigation. Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

Researchers have endeavored for decades to develop computational methods to predict the distribution of conformations, which is far harder to determine experimentally than a static folded structure. We present ConforMix, an inference-time algorithm that enhances sampling of conformational distributions using a combination of classifier guidance, filtering, and free energy estimation. Our approach upgrades diffusion models -- whether trained for static structure prediction or conformational generation -- to enable more efficient discovery of conformational variability without requiring prior knowledge of major degrees of freedom. ConforMix is orthogonal to improvements in model pretraining and would benefit even a hypothetical model that perfectly reproduced the Boltzmann distribution. Remarkably, when applied to a diffusion model trained for static structure prediction, ConforMix captures structural changes including domain motion, cryptic pocket flexibility, and transporter cycling, while avoiding unphysical states. Case studies of biologically critical proteins demonstrate the scalability, accuracy, and utility of this method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/drorlab/conformix</p></details> |

However, the inherent latent compression often introduces pixel-level inconsistencies, such as chromatic shifts, texture mismatches, and visible seams along editing boundaries. Existing remedies, including background-conditioned latent decoding and pixel-space harmonization, usually fail to fully eliminate these artifacts in practice and do not generalize well across different latent representations or tasks. We introduce PixPerfect, a pixel-level refinement framework that delivers seamless, high-fidelity local edits across diverse LDM architectures and tasks. PixPerfect leverages (i) a differentiable discriminative pixel space that amplifies and suppresses subtle color and texture discrepancies, (ii) a comprehensive artifact simulation pipeline that exposes the refiner to realistic local editing artifacts during training, and (iii) a direct pixel-space refinement scheme that ensures broad applicability across diverse latent representations and tasks. Extensive experiments on inpainting, object removal, and insertion benchmarks demonstrate that PixPerfect substantially enhances perceptual fidelity and downstream editing performance, establishing a new standard for robust and high-fidelity localized image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Thirty-ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

The method decomposes a large reward tilt $\exp(λr)$ into $N$ sequential smaller tilts, each admitting a tractable score update via first-order Taylor expansion. This requires only forward evaluations of the reward function and avoids backpropagating through sampling chains.

Tokenizer training typically follows a standard recipe in which images are compressed and reconstructed subject to a combination of MSE, perceptual, and adversarial losses. Diffusion autoencoders have been proposed in prior work as a way to learn end-to-end perceptually-oriented image compression, but have not yet shown state-of-the-art performance on the competitive task of ImageNet-1K reconstruction. We propose FlowMo, a transformer-based diffusion autoencoder that achieves a new state-of-the-art for image tokenization at multiple compression rates without using convolutions, adversarial losses, spatially-aligned two-dimensional latent codes, or distilling from other tokenizers. Our key insight is that FlowMo training should be broken into a mode-matching pre-training stage and a mode-seeking post-training stage. In addition, we conduct extensive analyses and explore the training of generative models atop the FlowMo tokenizer. Our code and models will be available at http://kylesargent.github.io/flowmo .</p></details> | ICCV 2025, 19 pages |

Integrating dMRI with the compartment-based biophysical VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) framework offers richer microstructural insights, though clinical gradient systems (40-80 mT/m) suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at stronger diffusion weightings due to prolonged echo times. Ultra-strong gradients (up to 300 mT/m) can mitigate these limitations by improving SNR and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) but their adoption has until recently been limited to research environments due to challenges with peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds and gradient non-uniformity. This study investigates whether physics-informed self-supervised VERDICT (ssVERDICT) fitting applied to ultra-strong gradients enhances prostate cancer characterization relative to current clinical acquisitions. We developed enhanced ssVERDICT fitting approaches using dense multilayer perceptron (Dense MLP) and convolutional U-Net architectures, benchmarking them against non-linear least-squares (NLLS) fitting and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging across clinical- to ultra-strong gradient systems. Dense ssVERDICT at ultra-strong gradient notably outperformed NLLS VERDICT, boosting median CNR by 47%, cutting inter-patient Coefficient of Variation by 52%, and reducing pooled f_ic variation by 50%. Overall, it delivered the highest CNR, the most stable parameter estimates, and the clearest tumour-normal contrast compared with conventional methods and clinical gradient systems. These findings highlight the potential of advanced gradient systems and deep learning-based modelling to improve non-invasive prostate cancer characterization and reduce unnecessary biopsies.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 17 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

The newly merged state D (delayable) represents users who have received the information but delayed its spreading and may eventually choose not to share it at all. Based on the mean-field approximation method, we derive the dynamical equations of the model and investigate its convergence and stability conditions. Under these conditions, we further propose an approximation algorithm for the edge-deletion problem, aiming to minimize the influence of information diffusion by identifying approximate solutions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. We further demonstrate that CAMEO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any multi-view diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/CAMEO/</p></details> |

Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Yet, interpreting NMR spectra remains a time-consuming, manual process requiring extensive domain expertise. We introduce ChefNMR (CHemical Elucidation From NMR), an end-to-end framework that directly predicts an unknown molecule's structure solely from its 1D NMR spectra and chemical formula. We frame structure elucidation as conditional generation from an atomic diffusion model built on a non-equivariant transformer architecture. To model the complex chemical groups found in natural products, we generated a dataset of simulated 1D NMR spectra for over 111,000 natural products. ChefNMR predicts the structures of challenging natural product compounds with an unsurpassed accuracy of over 65%. This work takes a significant step toward solving the grand challenge of automating small-molecule structure elucidation and highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating molecular discovery.

Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.</p></details> |  |

We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.</p></details> |  |

This work presents an intermediate strategy, balancing performance and cost, by learning ODE integration using loss functions derived from the derivative-integral relationship, inspired by Monte Carlo integration and Picard iteration. From a geometric perspective, the losses operate by gradually extending the tangent to the secant, thus are named as secant losses. The target of secant losses is the same as that of diffusion models, or the diffusion model itself, leading to great training stability. By fine-tuning or distillation, the secant version of EDM achieves a $10$-step FID of $2.14$ on CIFAR-10, while the secant version of SiT-XL/2 attains a $4$-step FID of $2.27$ and an $8$-step FID of $1.96$ on ImageNet-$256\times256$.

However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.</p></details> | 25 pages, 9 figures |

However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices. Our study deepens the understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offers principles for guiding future architectural and algorithmic improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version; 15 pages, 16 figures</p></details> |

Unlike LMs, Diffusion Models typically optimize in pixel or VAE space, which does not align well with human perception, leading to slower and less efficient training during the preference alignment stage. We propose using a perceptual objective in the U-Net embedding space of the diffusion model to address these issues. Our approach involves fine-tuning Stable Diffusion 1.5 and XL using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO), and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) within this embedding space. This method significantly outperforms standard latent-space implementations across various metrics, including quality and computational cost. For SDXL, our approach provides 60.8\% general preference, 62.2\% visual appeal, and 52.1\% prompt following against original open-sourced SDXL-DPO on the PartiPrompts dataset, while significantly reducing compute. Our approach not only improves the efficiency and quality of human preference alignment for diffusion models but is also easily integrable with other optimization techniques.

To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

To address these limitations, we propose LAtent Planner (LAP), a framework that plans in a VAE-learned latent space that disentangles high-level intents from low-level kinematics, enabling our planner to capture rich, multi-modal driving strategies. We further introduce a fine-grained feature distillation mechanism to guide a better interaction and fusion between the high-level semantic planning space and the vectorized scene context. Notably, LAP can produce high-quality plans in one single denoising step, substantially reducing computational overhead. Through extensive evaluations on the large-scale nuPlan benchmark, LAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance among learning-based planning methods, while demonstrating an inference speed-up of at most 10 times over previous SOTA approaches. Code will be released at: https://github.com/jhz1192/Latent-Planner.</p></details> |  |

We develop a formalism based on replica theory to predict the fundamental limits of efficiently sampling the solution space using generative diffusion algorithms, conjectured to be saturated when the score function is provided by Approximate Message Passing. For the spherical perceptron with negative margin $κ$, we find that the uniform distribution over solutions can be efficiently sampled in most of the Replica Symmetric region of the $α$-$κ$ plane. In contrast, for binary weights, sampling from the uniform distribution remains intractable. A theoretical analysis of this obstruction leads us to identify a potential $U(s) = -\log(s)$, under which the corresponding tilted distribution becomes efficiently samplable via diffusion. Moreover, we show numerically that an annealing procedure over the shape of this potential yields a fast and robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling the solution space of the binary perceptron.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3 mi...</summary><p>v3 minor revision after NeurIPS's rebuttal</p></details> |

While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[AID: Agent Intent from Diffusion for Multi-Agent Informative Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02535v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information gathering in large-scale or time-critical scenarios (e.g., environmental monitoring, search and rescue) requires broad coverage within limited time budgets, motivating the use of multi-agent systems. These scenarios are commonly formulated as multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP), where multiple agents must coordinate to maximize information gain while operating under budget constraints. A central challenge in MAIPP is ensuring effective coordination while the belief over the environment evolves with incoming measurements. Recent learning-based approaches address this by using distributions over future positions as "intent" to support coordination. However, these autoregressive intent predictors are computationally expensive and prone to compounding errors. Inspired by the effectiveness of diffusion models as expressive, long-horizon policies, we propose AID, a fully decentralized MAIPP framework that leverages diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories in a non-autoregressive manner. AID first performs behavior cloning on trajectories produced by existing MAIPP planners and then fine-tunes the policy using reinforcement learning via Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO). This two-stage pipeline enables the policy to inherit expert behavior while learning improved coordination through online reward feedback. Experiments demonstrate that AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it is trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/marmotlab/AID.</p></details> |  |

We revisit diffusion-based Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches. Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple, model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Z-Image: An Efficient Image Generation Foundation Model with Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22699v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of high-performance image generation models is currently dominated by proprietary systems, such as Nano Banana Pro and Seedream 4.0. Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering One-Step Diffusion Model with Fidelity-Rich Decoder for Fast Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04979v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates. Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover, compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves decoding speed by more than 20$\times$.

| **[Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23846v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training, effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and performance compared to existing robust RL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Model-enhanced Multiobjective Optimization for Improving Forest Monitoring Efficiency in UAV-enabled Internet-of-Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02370v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is widely applied for forest monitoring, since the sensor nodes (SNs) in IoT network are low-cost and have computing ability to process the monitoring data. To further improve the performance of forest monitoring, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed as the data processors to enhance computing capability. However, efficient forest monitoring with limited energy budget and computing resource presents a significant challenge. For this purpose, this paper formulates a multi-objective optimization framework to simultaneously consider three optimization objectives, which are minimizing the maximum computing delay, minimizing the total motion energy consumption, and minimizing the maximum computing resource, corresponding to efficient forest monitoring, energy consumption reduction, and computing resource control, respectively. Due to the hybrid solution space that consists of continuous and discrete solutions, we propose a diffusion model-enhanced improved multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (IMOGWO) to solve the formulated framework. The simulation results show that the proposed IMOGWO outperforms other benchmarks for solving the formulated framework. Specifically, for a small-scale network with $6$ UAVs and $50$ SNs, compared to the suboptimal benchmark, IMOGWO reduces the motion energy consumption and the computing resource by $53.32\%$ and $9.83\%$, respectively, while maintaining computing delay at the same level. Similarly, for a large-scale network with $8$ UAVs and $100$ SNs, IMOGWO achieves reductions of $41.81\%$ in motion energy consumption and $7.93\%$ in computing resource, with the computing delay also remaining comparable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Model in Latent Space for Medical Image Segmentation Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01292v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods typically produce a single segmentation mask, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Recent generative models enable the creation of multiple plausible masks per image, mimicking the collaborative interpretation of several clinicians. However, these approaches remain computationally heavy. We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules. MedSegLatDiff is evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules). It achieves state of the art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores while simultaneously generating diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps. This provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making the model particularly suitable for clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Diffusion Models Excel at Tracking Similar-Looking Objects Without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02339v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Practical Guide for Incorporating Symmetry in Diffusion Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13431v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, equivariant neural networks for policy learning have shown promising improvements in sample efficiency and generalization, however, their wide adoption faces substantial barriers due to implementation complexity. Equivariant architectures typically require specialized mathematical formulations and custom network design, posing significant challenges when integrating with modern policy frameworks like diffusion-based models. In this paper, we explore a number of straightforward and practical approaches to incorporate symmetry benefits into diffusion policies without the overhead of full equivariant designs. Specifically, we investigate (i) invariant representations via relative trajectory actions and eye-in-hand perception, (ii) integrating equivariant vision encoders, and (iii) symmetric feature extraction with pretrained encoders using Frame Averaging. We first prove that combining eye-in-hand perception with relative or delta action parameterization yields inherent SE(3)-invariance, thus improving policy generalization. We then perform a systematic experimental study on those design choices for integrating symmetry in diffusion policies, and conclude that an invariant representation with equivariant feature extraction significantly improves the policy performance. Our method achieves performance on par with or exceeding fully equivariant architectures while greatly simplifying implementation.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[WARPD: World model Assisted Reactive Policy Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has become a promising approach for both manipulation and locomotion. Diffusion models are now widely used to train large, generalized policies that predict controls or trajectories, leveraging their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, this generality comes at the cost of larger model sizes and slower inference, an acute limitation for robotic tasks requiring high control frequencies. Moreover, Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular trajectory-generation approach, suffers from a trade-off between performance and action horizon: fewer diffusion queries lead to larger trajectory chunks, which in turn accumulate tracking errors. To overcome these challenges, we introduce WARPD (World model Assisted Reactive Policy Diffusion), a method that generates closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) directly, instead of open-loop trajectories. By learning behavioral distributions in parameter space rather than trajectory space, WARPD offers two major advantages: (1) extended action horizons with robustness to perturbations, while maintaining high task performance, and (2) significantly reduced inference costs. Empirically, WARPD outperforms DP in long-horizon and perturbed environments, and achieves multitask performance on par with DP while requiring only ~ 1/45th of the inference-time FLOPs per step.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Correction of Erroneous State Estimates via Diffusion Bayesian Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03102v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In emergency response and other high-stakes societal applications, early-stage state estimates critically shape downstream outcomes. Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct. It substantially outperforms classical SMC perturbations and RL-based methods under misalignment, and we provide theoretical guarantees that DEPF resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor.</p></details> |  |
