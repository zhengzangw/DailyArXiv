| **[Kling-Avatar: Grounding Multimodal Instructions for Cascaded Long-Duration Avatar Animation Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09595v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues, without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid, fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[Improving Video Diffusion Transformer Training by Multi-Feature Fusion and Alignment from Self-Supervised Vision Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09547v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results are available on our project page: https://align4gen.github.io/align4gen/</p></details> | 17 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Zero-shot 3D-Aware Trajectory-Guided image-to-video generation via Test-Time Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06723v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[S$^2$-Guidance: Stochastic Self Guidance for Training-Free Enhancement of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12880v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks, effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[RewardDance: Reward Scaling in Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08826v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Byted...</summary><p>Bytedance Seed Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[CamC2V: Context-aware Controllable Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06022v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive scene understanding and generative quality, incorporating image conditions to guide generation. However, these models primarily animate static images without extending beyond their provided context. Introducing additional constraints, such as camera trajectories, can enhance diversity but often degrade visual quality, limiting their applicability for tasks requiring faithful scene representation. We propose CamC2V, a context-to-video (C2V) model that integrates multiple image conditions as context with 3D constraints alongside camera control to enrich both global semantics and fine-grained visual details. This enables more coherent and context-aware video generation. Moreover, we motivate the necessity of temporal awareness for an effective context representation. Our comprehensive study on the RealEstate10K dataset demonstrates improvements in visual quality and camera controllability. We will publish our code upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeneVA: A Dataset of Human Annotations for Generative Text to Video Artifacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08818v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance and improving generative video quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reangle-A-Video: 4D Video Generation as Video-to-Video Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09151v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized multi-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data.

| **[BranchGRPO: Stable and Efficient GRPO with Structured Branching in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06040v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment. However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[HuMo: Human-Centric Video Generation via Collaborative Multi-Modal Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08519v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text, reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control, we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative multimodal-conditioned HCVG.

| **[Coefficients-Preserving Sampling for Reinforcement Learning with Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05952v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models, specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method, Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Attention of a Kiss: Exploring Attention Maps in Video Diffusion for XAIxArts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05323v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an artistic and technical investigation into the attention mechanisms of video diffusion transformers. Inspired by early video artists who manipulated analog video signals to create new visual aesthetics, this study proposes a method for extracting and visualizing cross-attention maps in generative video models. Built on the open-source Wan model, our tool provides an interpretable window into the temporal and spatial behavior of attention in text-to-video generation. Through exploratory probes and an artistic case study, we examine the potential of attention maps as both analytical tools and raw artistic material.

| **[Conditional Video Generation for High-Efficiency Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15269v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Criti...</summary><p>Critical methodology flaws invalidate key results</p></details> |
| **[ANYPORTAL: Zero-Shot Consistent Video Background Replacement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07472v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting. To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient solution for video content creation and editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, ICCV 2025, Website: https://gaowenshuo.github.io/AnyPortal/</p></details> |
| **[Preacher: Paper-to-Video Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09632v6)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible, well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a topdown approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation models.

| **[Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09822v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

| **[Llama Learns to Direct: DirectorLLM for Human-Centric Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14484v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce DirectorLLM, a novel video generation model that employs a large language model (LLM) to orchestrate human poses within videos. As foundational text-to-video models rapidly evolve, the demand for high-quality human motion and interaction grows. To address this need and enhance the authenticity of human motions, we extend the LLM from a text generator to a video director and human motion simulator. Utilizing open-source resources from Llama 3, we train the DirectorLLM to generate detailed instructional signals, such as human poses, to guide video generation. This approach offloads the simulation of human motion from the video generator to the LLM, effectively creating informative outlines for human-centric scenes. These signals are used as conditions by the video renderer, facilitating more realistic and prompt-following video generation. As an independent LLM module, it can be applied to different video renderers, including UNet and DiT, with minimal effort. Experiments on automatic evaluation benchmarks and human evaluations show that our model outperforms existing ones in generating videos with higher human motion fidelity, improved prompt faithfulness, and enhanced rendered subject naturalness.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniVerse-1: Unified Audio-Video Generation via Stitching of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06155v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations. Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research community.

| **[Virtual Fitting Room: Generating Arbitrarily Long Videos of Virtual Try-On from a Single Image -- Technical Preview](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04450v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process, eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data, while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments. To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions, making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://immortalco.github.io/VirtualFittingRoom/</p></details> |

However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types.

| **[CompSlider: Compositional Slider for Disentangled Multiple-Attribute Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01028v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes, preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach, CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[BusterX: MLLM-Powered AI-Generated Video Forgery Detection and Explanation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12620v5)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lost in Latent Space: An Empirical Study of Latent Diffusion Models for Physics Emulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02608v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</p></details> |  |

While fine-tuning large pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a 1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025 Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and strong generality.

As a result, the field of video production is undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models are typically constrained by high computational costs. In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design. These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos. By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%. Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and customization. The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a pioneering system for next-generation content creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Existing video captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content.

To address these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions. Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator, significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding. Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism.

| **[Accelerating Diffusion Sampling via Exploiting Local Transition Coherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09675v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in generating high-quality images and videos from textual descriptions. However, the lengthy sampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in practical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical relationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity between them, which often only works with specific network structures. To address this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the transition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the outputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on the network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel training-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified relationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent steps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure, LTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to almost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with them. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up sampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining competitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of 1.67-fold in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55-fold in video generation models. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable 10-fold speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than 16FPS.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[VPO: Aligning Text-to-Video Generation Models with Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20491v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video tasks. These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly detailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs during inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes prompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods often rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context learning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent, omit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize prompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can lead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a principled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles: harmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully preserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of generated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization approach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset based on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both text-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with preference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO significantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to baseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video generation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be combined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the effectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models.

Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges, we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuaDreamer: Controllable Panoramic Video Generation for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02512v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

| **[Mixture of Contexts for Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21058v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://primecai.github.io/moc/</p></details> |

Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models. To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii) conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment, temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pose-paper.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, building such a practical system that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains challenging to existing methods, which often struggle with heavy computational cost and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal control and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal modifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts multimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs spatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising process of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale dialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing rich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep compression autoencoder with up to 64$\times$ reduction ratio, which effectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive model. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human synthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach in low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/showlab/Ego-PM</p></details> |

Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects. Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.</p></details> |  |

Given an image of an object and a set of "drags" specifying the trajectory of a few points on the object, the model synthesizes a video where the object's parts move accordingly. To build Puppet-Master, we extend a pre-trained image-to-video generator to encode the input drags. We also propose all-to-first attention, an alternative to conventional spatial attention that mitigates artifacts caused by fine-tuning a video generator on out-of-domain data. The model is fine-tuned on Objaverse-Animation-HQ, a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips obtained by rendering synthetic 3D animations. Unlike real videos, these synthetic clips avoid confounding part-level motion with overall object and camera motion. We extensively filter sub-optimal animations and augment the synthetic renderings with meaningful drags that emphasize the internal dynamics of objects. We demonstrate that Puppet-Master learns to generate part-level motions, unlike other motion-conditioned video generators that primarily move the object as a whole. Moreover, Puppet-Master generalizes well to out-of-domain real images, outperforming existing methods on real-world benchmarks in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

| **[Unlearning Concepts from Text-to-Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14209v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of computer vision and natural language processing, text-to-video generation, enabled by text-to-video diffusion models, has become more prevalent. These models are trained using a large amount of data from the internet. However, the training data often contain copyrighted content, including cartoon character icons and artist styles, private portraits, and unsafe videos. Since filtering the data and retraining the model is challenging, methods for unlearning specific concepts from text-to-video diffusion models have been investigated. However, due to the high computational complexity and relative large optimization scale, there is little work on unlearning methods for text-to-video diffusion models. We propose a novel concept-unlearning method by transferring the unlearning capability of the text encoder of text-to-image diffusion models to text-to-video diffusion models. Specifically, the method optimizes the text encoder using few-shot unlearning, where several generated images are used. We then use the optimized text encoder in text-to-video diffusion models to generate videos. Our method costs low computation resources and has small optimization scale. We discuss the generated videos after unlearning a concept. The experiments demonstrates that our method can unlearn copyrighted cartoon characters, artist styles, objects and people's facial characteristics. Our method can unlearn a concept within about 100 seconds on an RTX 3070. Since there was no concept unlearning method for text-to-video diffusion models before, we make concept unlearning feasible and more accessible in the text-to-video domain.</p></details> |  |

However, they largely overlook the crucial task of facial attribute editing. This capability is indispensable for achieving deep personalization and expanding the range of practical applications, including user-tailored digital avatars, engaging online education content, and brand-specific digital customer service. In these key domains, flexible adjustment of visual attributes, such as hairstyle, accessories, and subtle facial features, is essential for aligning with user preferences, reflecting diverse brand identities and adapting to varying contextual demands. In this paper, we present FaceEditTalker, a unified framework that enables controllable facial attribute manipulation while generating high-quality, audio-synchronized talking head videos. Our method consists of two key components: an image feature space editing module, which extracts semantic and detail features and allows flexible control over attributes like expression, hairstyle, and accessories; and an audio-driven video generation module, which fuses these edited features with audio-guided facial landmarks to drive a diffusion-based generator. This design ensures temporal coherence, visual fidelity, and identity preservation across frames. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to representative baseline methods in lip-sync accuracy, video quality, and attribute controllability.

While feature caching offers a promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model. Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline fidelity while significantly improving efficiency.

However, most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details, such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V), image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single, integrated framework.

To ensure training data quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis.

However, when addressing the side effects of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision. This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes, objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

However, they often fall short in more complex film and television productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan. Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions. Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.</p></details> |  |

However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the impact of lighting is deeply coupled with other factors of videos, e.g., objects and scenes. Thus, it remains challenging to disentangle and model coherent lighting conditions independently, limiting the flexibility to control lighting in video generation. In this paper, inspired by the established controllable T2I models, we propose LumiSculpt, which enables precise and consistent lighting control in T2V generation models. LumiSculpt equips the video generation with new interactive capabilities, allowing the input of reference image sequences with customized lighting conditions. Furthermore, the core learnable plug-and-play module of LumiSculpt facilitates direct control over the intensity, position and trajectory of an assumed light source in video diffusion models. To effectively train LumiSculpt and address the issue of insufficient lighting data, we construct LumiHuman, a new lightweight and flexible dataset for portrait lighting of images and videos. Experimental results demonstrate that LumiSculpt achieves precise and high-quality lighting control in video generation. The analysis demonstrates the flexibility of LumiHuman.</p></details> |  |

However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

The practical and economic barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2 world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset, blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1 mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained industrial applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos, limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic and structurally coherent human videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://hywang2002.github.io/MoCo</p></details> |
| **[DiCache: Let Diffusion Model Determine Its Own Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17356v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image generation.</p></details> |  |

However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control and overall consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiCache: Training-free Acceleration of Diffusion Models via Hermite Polynomial-based Feature Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16984v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

To address key challenges in video-to-audio generation, including multimodal data scarcity, modality imbalance and limited audio quality in existing methods, we propose HunyuanVideo-Foley, an end-to-end text-video-to-audio framework that synthesizes high-fidelity audio precisely aligned with visual dynamics and semantic context. Our approach incorporates three core innovations: (1) a scalable data pipeline curating 100k-hour multimodal datasets through automated annotation; (2) a representation alignment strategy using self-supervised audio features to guide latent diffusion training, efficiently improving audio quality and generation stability; (3) a novel multimodal diffusion transformer resolving modal competition, containing dual-stream audio-video fusion through joint attention, and textual semantic injection via cross-attention. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HunyuanVideo-Foley achieves new state-of-the-art performance across audio fidelity, visual-semantic alignment, temporal alignment and distribution matching.

| **[Seeing Clearly, Forgetting Deeply: Revisiting Fine-Tuned Video Generators for Driving Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16512v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecast then Calibrate: Feature Caching as ODE for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16211v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps. However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE. We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world applications, users are often presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity (binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~group-inference, GitHub: https://github.com/GaParmar/group-inference</p></details> |

Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning, and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create 360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a \textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation, respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model} based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.

Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and improving the fidelity of generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://johanan528.github.io/worldweaver_web/</p></details> |
| **[Capturing Stable HDR Videos Using a Dual-Camera System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06593v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High Dynamic Range (HDR) video acquisition using the alternating exposure (AE) paradigm has garnered significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness with a single consumer camera. However, despite progress driven by deep neural networks, these methods remain prone to temporal flicker in real-world applications due to inter-frame exposure inconsistencies. To address this challenge while maintaining the cost-effectiveness of the AE paradigm, we propose a novel learning-based HDR video generation solution. Specifically, we propose a dual-stream HDR video generation paradigm that decouples temporal luminance anchoring from exposure-variant detail reconstruction, overcoming the inherent limitations of the AE paradigm. To support this, we design an asynchronous dual-camera system (DCS), which enables independent exposure control across two cameras, eliminating the need for synchronization typically required in traditional multi-camera setups. Furthermore, an exposure-adaptive fusion network (EAFNet) is formulated for the DCS system. EAFNet integrates a pre-alignment subnetwork that aligns features across varying exposures, ensuring robust feature extraction for subsequent fusion, an asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork that emphasizes reference-based attention to effectively merge these features across exposures, and a reconstruction subnetwork to mitigate ghosting artifacts and preserve fine details. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, showing the remarkable potential of our solution in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured by DCS will be available at https://zqqqyu.github.io/DCS-HDR/.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods lack spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem, we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table. Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7% average success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications.

However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools.

To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored to individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as SOTA VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive human annotations to ensure evaluation alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors.

Specifically, LetsTalk introduces a memory bank combined with a noise-regularized training strategy to mitigate error accumulation and sampling artifacts during long video generation. To further enhance efficiency and spatiotemporal consistency, LetsTalk employs a deep compression autoencoder and a spatiotemporal-aware transformer with linear attention for effective multimodal fusion. Furthermore, we systematically analyze three multimodal fusion schemes, adopting deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait features to ensure visual consistency, and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio to synchronize animation with speech while preserving motion diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LetsTalk achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic talking videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, while maintaining remarkable efficiency with 8 fewer parameters than previous approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

However, current methods underutilize their distribution modeling capabilities for predicting future states. Two challenges hinder progress: integrating generative processes into feature learning is both technically and conceptually underdeveloped, and naive frame-by-frame video diffusion is computationally inefficient for real-time robotics. To address these, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a dual-system world model for real-time, risk-aware planning. MinD uses two asynchronous diffusion processes: a low-frequency visual generator (LoDiff) that predicts future scenes and a high-frequency diffusion policy (HiDiff) that outputs actions. Our key insight is that robotic policies do not require fully denoised frames but can rely on low-resolution latents generated in a single denoising step. To connect early predictions to actions, we introduce DiffMatcher, a video-action alignment module with a novel co-training strategy that synchronizes the two diffusion models. MinD achieves a 63% success rate on RL-Bench, 60% on real-world Franka tasks, and operates at 11.3 FPS, demonstrating the efficiency of single-step latent features for control signals. Furthermore, MinD identifies 74% of potential task failures in advance, providing real-time safety signals for monitoring and intervention. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient and reliable robotic manipulation using generative world models.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided, subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced DreamSwapV-Benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality.

Meanwhile, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image and video generation, making them attractive for network optimization tasks. In this paper, we propose xDiff, a diffusion-based reinforcement learning(RL) framework for inter-cell interference management (ICIM) in O-RAN. We first formulate ICIM as a resource allocation optimization problem aimed at maximizing a user-defined reward function and then develop an online learning solution by integrating a diffusion model into an RL framework for near-real-time policy generation. Particularly, we introduce a novel metric, preference values, as the policy representation to enable efficient policy-guided resource allocation within O-RAN distributed units (DUs). We implement xDiff on a 5G testbed consisting of three cells and a set of smartphones in two small-cell scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that xDiff outperforms state-of-the-art ICIM approaches, highlighting the potential of diffusion models for online optimization of O-RAN.

However, conventional video dubbing techniques remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

By leveraging the strong dynamic priors captured by large-scale pre-trained video models, Geo4D can be trained using only synthetic data while generalizing well to real data in a zero-shot manner. Geo4D predicts several complementary geometric modalities, namely point, disparity, and ray maps. We propose a new multi-modal alignment algorithm to align and fuse these modalities, as well as a sliding window approach at inference time, thus enabling robust and accurate 4D reconstruction of long videos.

With rising demands in the logistics sector, the development of automated systems utilizing advanced technologies has become increasingly crucial. Moreover, the widespread use of plastic wrapping has motivated researchers to investigate eco-friendly alternatives that still adhere to safety standards. We present a fully controllable and accurate physical simulation system capable of replicating the behavior of moving pallets. It features a 3D graphics-based virtual environment that supports a wide range of configurations, including variable package layouts, different wrapping materials, and diverse dynamic conditions. This innovative approach reduces the need for physical testing, cutting costs and environmental impact while improving measurement accuracy for analyzing pallet dynamics. Additionally, we train a deep neural network to evaluate the rendered videos generated by our simulator, as a crash-test predictor for pallet configurations, further enhancing the system's utility in safety analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Upsample What Matters: Region-Adaptive Latent Sampling for Accelerated Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08422v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.</p></details> |  |

Action-driven video generation faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions (HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of cross-domain dynamics. Experiments on EgoVid, RT-1 and DROID demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint egocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key challenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated video must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion; 2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the observed visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these challenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built on the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a head-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head joint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that explicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within attention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale real-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel metrics to assess video-motion consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the EgoTwin framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing interactive world models depend on bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step auto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) A scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to effectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with diverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables frame-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step distillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video generation. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos across diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our model weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://matrix-game-v2.github.io</p></details> |

Current approaches, such as factorized attention and fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern, cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

During translation, it is essential to preserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate consistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen, an end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video generative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the control of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified paired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we construct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic videos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the community, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in diverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting simulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the aforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively unleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in synthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos. To implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple the learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from the perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into cinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground preservation.

However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless, existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies, struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference efficiency compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

These interactions are essential for emerging biometric authentication systems, which rely on interactive motion-based anti-spoofing approaches. From a security perspective, there is a growing need for large-scale, high-quality interactive videos to train and strengthen authentication models. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for animating realistic hand-face interactions. Our approach simultaneously learns spatio-temporal contact dynamics and biomechanically plausible deformation effects, enabling natural interactions where hand movements induce anatomically accurate facial deformations while maintaining collision-free contact. To facilitate this research, we present InterHF, a large-scale hand-face interaction dataset featuring 18 interaction patterns and 90,000 annotated videos. Additionally, we propose InterAnimate, a region-aware diffusion model designed specifically for interaction animation. InterAnimate leverages learnable spatial and temporal latents to effectively capture dynamic interaction priors and integrates a region-aware interaction mechanism that injects these priors into the denoising process. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first large-scale effort to systematically study human hand-face interactions. Qualitative and quantitative results show InterAnimate produces highly realistic animations, setting a new benchmark.

Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality. Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR) video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.</p></details> |  |

Even with scaled-up models and massive datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable, largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing baselines across all criteria.</p></details> | 27 pages, 20 figures |

Existing text-to-video (T2V) models commonly employ spatial cross-attention for text control, equivalently guiding different frame generations without frame-specific textual guidance. Thus, the model's capacity to comprehend the temporal logic conveyed in prompts and generate videos with coherent motion is restricted. To tackle this limitation, we introduce FancyVideo, an innovative video generator that improves the existing text-control mechanism with the well-designed Cross-frame Textual Guidance Module (CTGM). Specifically, CTGM incorporates the Temporal Information Injector (TII) and Temporal Affinity Refiner (TAR) at the beginning and end of cross-attention, respectively, to achieve frame-specific textual guidance. Firstly, TII injects frame-specific information from latent features into text conditions, thereby obtaining cross-frame textual conditions. Then, TAR refines the correlation matrix between cross-frame textual conditions and latent features along the time dimension. Extensive experiments comprising both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FancyVideo. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art T2V generation results on the EvalCrafter benchmark and facilitates the synthesis of dynamic and consistent videos. Note that the T2V process of FancyVideo essentially involves a text-to-image step followed by T+I2V. This means it also supports the generation of videos from user images, i.e., the image-to-video (I2V) task. A significant number of experiments have shown that its performance is also outstanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

However, these methods heavily depend on the quality of generated data and struggle with fine-grained manipulation due to the lack of environment feedback. While video-based reinforcement learning improves policy robustness, it remains constrained by the uncertainty of video generation and the challenges of collecting large-scale robot datasets for training diffusion models. To address these limitations, we propose GenFlowRL, which derives shaped rewards from generated flow trained from diverse cross-embodiment datasets. This enables learning generalizable and robust policies from diverse demonstrations using low-dimensional, object-centric features.

However, generating videos that adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video generation paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://haroldchen19.github.io/PhysHPO-Page/</p></details> |

To address these, we present two key innovations. First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The code and dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/rain152/LFA-Video-Generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM) that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.</p></details> | Tech report |
| **[AEGIS: Authenticity Evaluation Benchmark for AI-Generated Video Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10771v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity, failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse, state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion, CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats.

| **[EVCtrl: Efficient Control Adapter for Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10963v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[VMem: Consistent Interactive Video Scene Generation with Surfel-Indexed View Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18903v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel memory module for building video generators capable of interactively exploring environments. Previous approaches have achieved similar results either by out-painting 2D views of a scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry-which quickly accumulates errors-or by using video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a memory module that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost required to use all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 highlight.

| **[HM-Talker: Hybrid Motion Modeling for High-Fidelity Talking Head Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10566v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads. HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Yan: Foundational Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08601v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation, covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing. Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

| **[M2DAO-Talker: Harmonizing Multi-granular Motion Decoupling and Alternating Optimization for Talking-head Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08307v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur, temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization. Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy. Meanwhile, a motion consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS inference speed.

| **[Locality in Image Diffusion Models Emerges from Data Statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09672v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models, proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior expert-crafted alternative.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 18 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Directly Aligning the Full Diffusion Trajectory with Fine-Grained Human Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06942v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However, they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive, thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX model with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Mechanistic Learning with Guided Diffusion Models to Predict Spatio-Temporal Brain Tumor Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09610v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time predictions that account for mechanistic priors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis.

| **[Improving Video Diffusion Transformer Training by Multi-Feature Fusion and Alignment from Self-Supervised Vision Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09547v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results are available on our project page: https://align4gen.github.io/align4gen/</p></details> | 17 pages, 14 figures |

By integrating heterogeneous data from multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1) Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF) method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data. Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks.

| **[Learning functions through Diffusion Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03758v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator. To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing computational cost. Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction, demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |
| **[The Information Dynamics of Generative Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19897v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of models in machine learning, yet a unified theoretical understanding of their operation is still developing. This paper provides an integrated perspective on generative diffusion by connecting their dynamic, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic properties under a unified mathematical framework. We demonstrate that the rate of conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the generative bandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the score function's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the branching of trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis offers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by the controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks in information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible outcomes. The score function acts as a dynamic non-linear filter that regulates the bandwidth of the noise by suppressing fluctuations that are incompatible with the data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A hyperbolic finite difference scheme for anisotropic diffusion equations: preserving the discrete maximum principle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09509v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A hyperbolic system approach is proposed for robust computation of anisotropic diffusion equations that appear in quasineutral plasmas. Though the approach exhibits merits of high extensibility and accurate flux computation, the monotonicity of the scheme for anisotropic diffusion cases has not been understood. In this study, the discrete maximum principle (DMP) of the hyperbolic system approach is analyzed and tested in various anisotropic diffusion cases. A mathematical analysis is conducted to obtain an optimal condition of an arbitrary parameter to guarantee the DMP, and numerical experiments reveal an adoptive selection of the parameter for DMP-preserving results. It is confirmed that, with an appropriate preconditioning matrix and parameter choice, the hyperbolic system approach preserves the DMP even with a linear discretization.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[FlexiD-Fuse: Flexible number of inputs multi-modal medical image fusion based on diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09456v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Composable Score-based Graph Diffusion Model for Multi-Conditional Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09451v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints. While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration (PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for flexible, multi-property molecular design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plug-and-play Diffusion Models for Image Compressive Sensing with Data Consistency Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09365v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[S$^2$-Guidance: Stochastic Self Guidance for Training-Free Enhancement of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12880v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks, effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Driven Discovery of Emergent Dynamics in Reaction Diffusion Systems from Sparse and Noisy Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09278v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity, particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology, epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics. A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models, such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data. This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.</p></details> |  |

Compared to traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane, providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text) guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA diagnosis.

| **[Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01085v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Graph Neural Networks for Robustness in Olfaction Sensors and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00455v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

| **[Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results.

Naively integrating these modules presents compatibility challenges when diffusion's multi-modal outputs behave adversarially to optimization-based modules. To address this, we introduce Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion (JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework. JM2D formulates module integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility via an interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling, JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction potential, thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from non-convex optimization modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning diffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation. JM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

| **[Integrating Anatomical Priors into a Causal Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09054v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses, particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches. Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature. This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in studies investigating subtle morphological differences.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness.

Unlike the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial analysis and decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion Transformer-Based Text-to-Speech with Transformer Layer Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08696v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a method to accelerate the inference process of diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models by applying a selective caching mechanism to transformer layers. Specifically, I integrate SmoothCache into the F5-TTS architecture, focusing on caching outputs of self-attention and feed-forward network layers to reduce redundant computations during the denoising process. A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative errors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that minimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency, a unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from self-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and Seed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step configurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces inference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower steps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total number of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the effectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving computational efficiency. Comparisons between cached inference and reduced-step inference further highlight the benefits of selective caching, especially under high-step configurations. This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching is a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models without requiring architectural changes or retraining. Example inference results can be heard at https://siratish.github.io/F5-TTS_SmoothCache/ .</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[LADB: Latent Aligned Diffusion Bridges for Semi-Supervised Domain Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08628v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data. By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods, which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task, showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases. Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly or incomplete.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spherical Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models for Conditional Cortical Thickness Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08442v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness (CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes, providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet), which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.</p></details> |  |

This paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start, significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task, our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning. https://masteryip.github.io/pegasusflow.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | 30 pages |

The concept involves training a score network to predict the gradient of the log density of mel-spectrograms from various speakers. VC is executed by iteratively adjusting an input mel-spectrogram until resembling the target speaker's. However, challenges persist: audio quality needs improvement, and conversion is slower compared to modern VC methods designed to operate at very high speeds. To address these, we introduce latent diffusion models into VoiceGrad, proposing an improved version with reverse diffusion in the autoencoder bottleneck. Additionally, we propose using a flow matching model as an alternative to the diffusion model to further speed up the conversion process without compromising the conversion quality. Experimental results show enhanced speech quality and accelerated conversion compared to the original.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE-TASLP</p></details> |

Our proposed method is a self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader field of video analysis and generation.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, despite producing holistically appealing text images, diffusion-based visual text generation methods struggle to synthesize accurate and realistic instance-level text at scale. To tackle this, we introduce TextSSR: a novel pipeline for Synthesizing Scene Text Recognition training data. TextSSR targets three key synthesizing characteristics: accuracy, realism, and scalability. It achieves accuracy through a proposed region-centric text generation with position-glyph enhancement, ensuring proper character placement. It maintains realism by guiding style and appearance generation using contextual hints from surrounding text or background. This character-aware diffusion architecture enjoys precise character-level control and semantic coherence preservation, without relying on natural language prompts. Therefore, TextSSR supports large-scale generation through combinatorial text permutations. Based on these, we present TextSSR-F, a dataset of 3.55 million quality-screened text instances. Extensive experiments show that STR models trained on TextSSR-F outperform those trained on existing synthetic datasets by clear margins on common benchmarks, and further improvements are observed when mixed with real-world training data.

However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at https://github.com/boshizhang123/SGDFuse.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Information Fusion</p></details> |

Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output control, and dynamic perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. A growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to \textit{10$\times$} acceleration in inference speed. These developments position discrete diffusion models as a promising alternative to intelligence based on the traditional autoregressive approach. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains and \textit{etc.}. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment. Relative papers are collected in https://github.com/LiQiiiii/Awesome-Discrete-Diffusion-LLM_MLLM</p></details> |  |

We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic, label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing. Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training; per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$), channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts -- to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable failure modes for future work.</p></details> | 16 Pages, 6 figures |

Inspired by Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), which decomposes planning into single-agent problems coupled with collision resolution, we propose a novel diffusion-guided multi-arm planner (DG-MAP) that enhances scalability of learning-based models while reducing their reliance on massive multi-arm datasets. Recognizing that collisions are primarily pairwise, we train two conditional diffusion models, one to generate feasible single-arm trajectories, and a second, to model the dual-arm dynamics required for effective pairwise collision resolution. By integrating these specialized generative models within a MAPF-inspired structured decomposition, our planner efficiently scales to larger number of arms. Evaluations against alternative learning-based methods across various team sizes demonstrate our method's effectiveness and practical applicability.

Targeting vision-related domains, this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature. One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into these DNNs' feature spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 13 figures, codes: https://github.com/KimiakiShirahama/FeatureSpaceAnalysisByGuidedDiffusionModel</p></details> |

Nevertheless, previous optimization methods often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

It currently has at least three unresolved core issues: (i) heavy reliance on label annotation and synthetic data -- causing poor generalization on natural scenarios; (ii) heuristic/hand-craft disentangling constraints make it hard to adaptively achieve an optimal training trade-off; (iii) lacking reasonable evaluation metric, especially for the real label-free data. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{C}losed-\textbf{L}oop unsupervised representation \textbf{Dis}entanglement approach dubbed \textbf{CL-Dis}. Specifically, we use diffusion-based autoencoder (Diff-AE) as a backbone while resorting to $\beta$-VAE as a co-pilot to extract semantically disentangled representations. The strong generation ability of diffusion model and the good disentanglement ability of VAE model are complementary. To strengthen disentangling, VAE-latent distillation and diffusion-wise feedback are interconnected in a closed-loop system for a further mutual promotion. Then, a self-supervised \textbf{Navigation} strategy is introduced to identify interpretable semantic directions in the disentangled latent space. Finally, a new metric based on content tracking is designed to evaluate the disentanglement effect. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CL-Dis on applications like real image manipulation and visual analysis.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

| **[Decoupled Sparse Priors Guided Diffusion Compression Model for Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13860v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lossy compression methods rely on an autoencoder to transform a point cloud into latent points for storage, leaving the inherent redundancy of latent representations unexplored. To reduce redundancy in latent points, we propose a sparse priors guided method that achieves high reconstruction quality, especially at high compression ratios. This is accomplished by a dual-density scheme separately processing the latent points (intended for reconstruction) and the decoupled sparse priors (intended for storage). Our approach features an efficient dual-density data flow that relaxes size constraints on latent points, and hybridizes a progressive conditional diffusion model to encapsulate essential details for reconstruction within the conditions, which are decoupled hierarchically to intra-point and inter-point priors. Specifically, our method encodes the original point cloud into latent points and decoupled sparse priors through separate encoders. Latent points serve as intermediates, while sparse priors act as adaptive conditions. We then employ a progressive attention-based conditional denoiser to generate latent points conditioned on the decoupled priors, allowing the denoiser to dynamically attend to geometric and semantic cues from the priors at each encoding and decoding layer. Additionally, we integrate the local distribution into the arithmetic encoder and decoder to enhance local context modeling of the sparse points. The original point cloud is reconstructed through a point decoder. Compared to state-of-the-art, our method obtains superior rate-distortion trade-off, evidenced by extensive evaluations on the ShapeNet dataset and standard test datasets from MPEG group including 8iVFB, and Owlii.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Humanoid Manipulation with 3D Diffusion Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10803v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots capable of autonomous operation in diverse environments have long been a goal for roboticists. However, autonomous manipulation by humanoid robots has largely been restricted to one specific scene, primarily due to the difficulty of acquiring generalizable skills and the expensiveness of in-the-wild humanoid robot data. In this work, we build a real-world robotic system to address this challenging problem. Our system is mainly an integration of 1) a whole-upper-body robotic teleoperation system to acquire human-like robot data, 2) a 25-DoF humanoid robot platform with a height-adjustable cart and a 3D LiDAR sensor, and 3) an improved 3D Diffusion Policy learning algorithm for humanoid robots to learn from noisy human data. We run more than 2000 episodes of policy rollouts on the real robot for rigorous policy evaluation. Empowered by this system, we show that using only data collected in one single scene and with only onboard computing, a full-sized humanoid robot can autonomously perform skills in diverse real-world scenarios.

| **[Universal Few-Shot Spatial Control for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07530v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks, achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably, when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is available at https://github.com/kietngt00/UFC.</p></details> |  |

Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints, which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, ICIPW 2025, Website: https://gaowenshuo.github.io/LINR-bridge/</p></details> |

However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter (LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components. Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images, enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely 69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used will be publicly available via our project page: https://zx-yin.github.io/dreamlifting/.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, project page: https://zx-yin.github.io/dreamlifting/</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Distillation Driven Semantic NOMA for Image Transmission with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07363v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a promising 6G enabler beyond conventional bit-level transmission, semantic communication can considerably reduce required bandwidth resources, while its combination with multiple access requires further exploration. This paper proposes a knowledge distillation-driven and diffusion-enhanced (KDD) semantic non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), named KDD-SemNOMA, for multi-user uplink wireless image transmission. Specifically, to ensure robust feature transmission across diverse transmission conditions, we firstly develop a ConvNeXt-based deep joint source and channel coding architecture with enhanced adaptive feature module. This module incorporates signal-to-noise ratio and channel state information to dynamically adapt to additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, to improve image restoration quality without inference overhead, we introduce a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, i.e., a teacher model, trained on interference-free orthogonal transmission, guides a student model via feature affinity distillation and cross-head prediction distillation. Moreover, a diffusion model-based refinement stage leverages generative priors to transform initial SemNOMA outputs into high-fidelity images with enhanced perceptual quality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-256 datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions. These results highlight the advantages in both pixel-level accuracy and perceptual metrics, effectively mitigating interference and enabling high-quality image recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, the local and global properties of brain white matter networks are often overlooked in convolutional network design. We introduce TractGraphFormer, a hybrid Graph CNN-Transformer deep learning framework tailored for diffusion MRI tractography. This model leverages local anatomical characteristics and global feature dependencies of white matter structures. The Graph CNN module captures white matter geometry and grey matter connectivity to aggregate local features from anatomically similar white matter connections, while the Transformer module uses self-attention to enhance global information learning. Additionally, TractGraphFormer includes an attention module for interpreting predictive white matter connections. We apply TractGraphFormer to tasks of sex and age prediction. TractGraphFormer shows strong performance in large datasets of children (n=9345) and young adults (n=1065). Overall, our approach suggests that widespread connections in the WM are predictive of the sex and age of an individual. For each prediction task, consistent predictive anatomical tracts are identified across the two datasets. The proposed approach highlights the potential of integrating local anatomical information and global feature dependencies to improve prediction performance in machine learning with diffusion MRI tractography.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures |

We propose a framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI 2025)</p></details> |

Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models, namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks. TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1% relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building, training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and general tasks.

The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations. We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity. Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under additional unknown degradations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

We consider the case in which the cancer is "diffuse", dispersed such that there are multiple distinct cancer sites. We investigate the problem of a swarm of nanobots locating these sites and treating them by dropping drug payloads at the sites. To improve the success of the treatment, the drug payloads must be allocated between sites according to their "demands"; this requires extra nanobot coordination. We present a mathematical model of the behavior of the nanobot agents and of their colloidal environment. This includes a movement model for agents based upon experimental findings from actual nanoparticles in which bots noisily ascend and descend chemical gradients. We present three algorithms: The first algorithm, called KM, is the most representative of reality, with agents simply following naturally existing chemical signals that surround each cancer site. The second algorithm, KMA, includes an additional chemical payload which amplifies the existing natural signals. The third algorithm, KMAR, includes another additional chemical payload which counteracts the other signals, instead inducing negative chemotaxis in agents such that they are repelled from sites that are already sufficiently treated. We present simulation results for all algorithms across different types of cancer arrangements. For KM, we show that the treatment is generally successful unless the natural chemical signals are weak, in which case the treatment progresses too slowly. For KMA, we demonstrate a significant improvement in treatment speed but a drop in eventual success, except for concentrated cancer patterns. For KMAR, our results show great performance across all types of cancer patterns, demonstrating robustness and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abrid...</summary><p>Abridged abstract shown here; 34 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

This paper proposes an innovative image encryption scheme that integrates a novel 2D hyper-chaotic map with a newly developed self-adaptive diffusion method. The 2D hyper-chaotic map, namely the 2D-RA map, is designed by hybridizing the Rastrigin and Ackley functions. The chaotic performance of the 2D-RA map is validated through a series of measurements, including the Bifurcation Diagram, Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Initial Value Sensitivity, 0 - 1 Test, Correlation Dimension (CD), and Kolmogorov Entropy (KE). The results demonstrate that the chaotic performance of the 2D-RA map surpasses that of existing advanced chaotic functions. Additionally, the self-adaptive diffusion method is employed to enhance the uniformity of grayscale distribution. The performance of the image encryption scheme is evaluated using a series of indicators. The results show that the proposed image encryption scheme significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art image encryption techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAGE: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis via Graded Diffusion with Explicit Mask Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06693v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution, enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA) strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background, resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations. Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances downstream anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Controlled Langevin Diffusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07081v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An effective approach for sampling from unnormalized densities is based on the idea of gradually transporting samples from an easy prior to the complicated target distribution. Two popular methods are (1) Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), where the transport is performed through successive annealed densities via prescribed Markov chains and resampling steps, and (2) recently developed diffusion-based sampling methods, where a learned dynamical transport is used. Despite the common goal, both approaches have different, often complementary, advantages and drawbacks. The resampling steps in SMC allow focusing on promising regions of the space, often leading to robust performance. While the algorithm enjoys asymptotic guarantees, the lack of flexible, learnable transitions can lead to slow convergence. On the other hand, diffusion-based samplers are learned and can potentially better adapt themselves to the target at hand, yet often suffer from training instabilities. In this work, we present a principled framework for combining SMC with diffusion-based samplers by viewing both methods in continuous time and considering measures on path space. This culminates in the new Sequential Controlled Langevin Diffusion (SCLD) sampling method, which is able to utilize the benefits of both methods and reaches improved performance on multiple benchmark problems, in many cases using only 10% of the training budget of previous diffusion-based samplers.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Th...</summary><p>In The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2025</p></details> |

This limits their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across diverse settings.

| **[From Rigging to Waving: 3D-Guided Diffusion for Natural Animation of Hand-Drawn Characters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06573v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand-drawn character animation is a vibrant field in computer graphics, presenting challenges in achieving geometric consistency while conveying expressive motion. Traditional skeletal animation methods maintain geometric consistency but struggle with complex non-rigid elements like flowing hair and skirts, leading to unnatural deformation. Conversely, video diffusion models synthesize realistic dynamics but often create geometric distortions in stylized drawings due to domain gaps. This work proposes a hybrid animation system that combines skeletal animation and video diffusion. Initially, coarse images are generated from characters retargeted with skeletal animations for geometric guidance. These images are then enhanced in texture and secondary dynamics using video diffusion priors, framing this enhancement as an inpainting task. A domain-adapted diffusion model refines user-masked regions needing improvement, especially for secondary dynamics. To enhance motion realism further, we introduce a Secondary Dynamics Injection (SDI) strategy in the denoising process, incorporating features from a pre-trained diffusion model enriched with human motion priors. Additionally, to tackle unnatural deformations from low-poly single-mesh character modeling, we present a Hair Layering Modeling (HLM) technique that uses segmentation maps to separate hair from the body, allowing for more natural animation of long-haired characters. Extensive experiments show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIDE: Achieving Balanced Subject-Driven Image Generation via Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06499v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework, which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image, instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance, outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation, and text-image interpolation.

To address this issue, we propose a method to alleviate imbalances inherent in datasets through the generation of synthetic data based on sensitive attributes such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and health condition. We adopt ControlNet based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to condition on text assembled from patient metadata and cardiac geometry derived from segmentation masks. We assess our method using a large-cohort study from the UK Biobank by evaluating the realism of the generated images using established quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we conduct a downstream classification task aimed at debiasing a classifier by rectifying imbalances within underrepresented groups through synthetically generated samples. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating dataset imbalances, such as the scarcity of diagnosed female patients or individuals with normal BMI level suffering from heart failure. This work represents a major step towards the adoption of synthetic data for the development of fair and generalizable models for medical classification tasks. Notably, we conduct all our experiments using a single, consumer-level GPU to highlight the feasibility of our approach within resource-constrained environments.

We present a lightweight, interpretable and non-invasive framework for assessing information quality based solely on diffusion dynamics, demonstrated here in the context of academic publications. Using a heterogeneous dataset of 29,264 sciences, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) and social science papers from ArnetMiner and OpenAlex, we model the diffusion network of each paper as a set of three theoretically motivated features: diversity, timeliness, and salience. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) trained on these features achieved Pearson correlations of 0.834 for next-year citation gain and up to 95.62% accuracy in predicting high-impact papers. Feature relevance studies reveal timeliness and salience as the most robust predictors, while diversity offers less stable benefits in the academic setting but may be more informative in social media contexts. The framework's transparency, domain-agnostic design, and minimal feature requirements position it as a scalable tool for global information quality assessment, opening new avenues for moving beyond binary credibility labels toward richer, diffusion-informed evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |

Recent advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars. However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand, generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time, controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale, cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/HDA/</p></details> |

These methods typically inject low-resolution (LR) images via ControlNet.In this paper, we first explore the temporal dynamics of information infusion through ControlNet, revealing that the input from LR images predominantly influences the initial stages of the denoising process. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel timestep-aware diffusion model that adaptively integrates features from both ControlNet and the pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD). Our method enhances the transmission of LR information in the early stages of diffusion to guarantee image fidelity and stimulates the generation ability of the SD model itself more in the later stages to enhance the detail of generated images. To train this method, we propose a timestep-aware training strategy that adopts distinct losses at varying timesteps and acts on disparate modules. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

| **[Any-Order Flexible Length Masked Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01025v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations. To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference. Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve $\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance ($52\% \to 65\%$).</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Home-made Diffusion Model from Scratch to Hatch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06068v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Home-made Diffusion Model (HDM), an efficient yet powerful text-to-image diffusion model optimized for training (and inferring) on consumer-grade hardware. HDM achieves competitive 1024x1024 generation quality while maintaining a remarkably low training cost of $535-620 using four RTX5090 GPUs, representing a significant reduction in computational requirements compared to traditional approaches. Our key contributions include: (1) Cross-U-Transformer (XUT), a novel U-shape transformer, Cross-U-Transformer (XUT), that employs cross-attention for skip connections, providing superior feature integration that leads to remarkable compositional consistency; (2) a comprehensive training recipe that incorporates TREAD acceleration, a novel shifted square crop strategy for efficient arbitrary aspect-ratio training, and progressive resolution scaling; and (3) an empirical demonstration that smaller models (343M parameters) with carefully crafted architectures can achieve high-quality results and emergent capabilities, such as intuitive camera control. Our work provides an alternative paradigm of scaling, demonstrating a viable path toward democratizing high-quality text-to-image generation for individual researchers and smaller organizations with limited computational resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamAudio: Customized Text-to-Audio Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06027v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of large-scale diffusion-based and language-modeling-based generative models, impressive progress has been achieved in text-to-audio generation. Despite producing high-quality outputs, existing text-to-audio models mainly aim to generate semantically aligned sound and fall short on precisely controlling fine-grained acoustic characteristics of specific sounds. As a result, users that need specific sound content may find it challenging to generate the desired audio clips. In this paper, we present DreamAudio for customized text-to-audio generation (CTTA). Specifically, we introduce a new framework that is designed to enable the model to identify auditory information from user-provided reference concepts for audio generation. Given a few reference audio samples containing personalized audio events, our system can generate new audio samples that include these specific events. In addition, two types of datasets are developed for training and testing the customized systems. The experiments show that the proposed model, DreamAudio, generates audio samples that are highly consistent with the customized audio features and aligned well with the input text prompts. Furthermore, DreamAudio offers comparable performance in general text-to-audio tasks. We also provide a human-involved dataset containing audio events from real-world CTTA cases as the benchmark for customized generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demos...</summary><p>Demos are available at https://yyua8222.github.io/DreamAudio_demopage/</p></details> |
| **[DiffOSeg: Omni Medical Image Segmentation via Multi-Expert Collaboration Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13087v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic ``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven (reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.

| **[ADIR: Adaptive Diffusion for Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03221v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in image generation, capturing rich information about natural image statistics. This makes them highly promising for image reconstruction, where the goal is to recover a clean image from a degraded observation. In this work, we introduce a conditional sampling framework that leverages the powerful priors learned by diffusion models while enforcing consistency with the available measurements. To further adapt pre-trained diffusion models to the specific degradation at hand, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy. In particular, we employ LoRA-based adaptation using images that are semantically and visually similar to the degraded input, efficiently retrieved from a large and diverse dataset via an off-the-shelf vision-language model. We evaluate our approach on two leading publicly available diffusion models--Stable Diffusion and Guided Diffusion--and demonstrate that our method, termed Adaptive Diffusion for Image Reconstruction (ADIR), yields substantial improvements across a range of image reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page https://shadyabh.github.io/ADIR/</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Strategy Guided Diffusion via Sparse Masking Temporal Reweighting Distribution Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05992v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information. The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of 2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Guided Diffusion Transformer with Spherical Harmonic Posterior Sampling for High-Fidelity Angular Super-Resolution in Diffusion MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07020v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion MRI (dMRI) angular super-resolution (ASR) aims to reconstruct high-angular-resolution (HAR) signals from limited low-angular-resolution (LAR) data without prolonging scan time. However, existing methods are limited in recovering fine-grained angular details or preserving high fidelity due to inadequate modeling of q-space geometry and insufficient incorporation of physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a Physics-Guided Diffusion Transformer (PGDiT) designed to explore physical priors throughout both training and inference stages. During training, a Q-space Geometry-Aware Module (QGAM) with b-vector modulation and random angular masking facilitates direction-aware representation learning, enabling the network to generate directionally consistent reconstructions with fine angular details from sparse and noisy data. In inference, a two-stage Spherical Harmonics-Guided Posterior Sampling (SHPS) enforces alignment with the acquired data, followed by heat-diffusion-based SH regularization to ensure physically plausible reconstructions. This coarse-to-fine refinement strategy mitigates oversmoothing and artifacts commonly observed in purely data-driven or generative models. Extensive experiments on general ASR tasks and two downstream applications, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), demonstrate that PGDiT outperforms existing deep learning models in detail recovery and data fidelity. Our approach presents a novel generative ASR framework that offers high-fidelity HAR dMRI reconstructions, with potential applications in neuroscience and clinical research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Separate Motion from Appearance: Customizing Motion via Customizing Text-to-Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16714v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion customization aims to adapt the diffusion model (DM) to generate videos with the motion specified by a set of video clips with the same motion concept. To realize this goal, the adaptation of DM should be possible to model the specified motion concept, without compromising the ability to generate diverse appearances. Thus, the key to solving this problem lies in how to separate the motion concept from the appearance in the adaptation process of DM. Typical previous works explore different ways to represent and insert a motion concept into large-scale pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, e.g., learning a motion LoRA, using latent noise residuals, etc. While those methods can encode the motion concept, they also inevitably encode the appearance in the reference videos, resulting in weakened appearance generation capability. In this paper, we follow the typical way to learn a motion LoRA to encode the motion concept, but propose two novel strategies to enhance motion-appearance separation, including temporal attention purification (TAP) and appearance highway (AH). Specifically, we assume that in the temporal attention module, the pretrained Value embeddings are sufficient to serve as basic components needed by producing a new motion. Thus, in TAP, we choose only to reshape the temporal attention with motion LoRAs so that Value embeddings can be reorganized to produce a new motion. Further, in AH, we alter the starting point of each skip connection in U-Net from the output of each temporal attention module to the output of each spatial attention module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to previous works, our method can generate videos with appearance more aligned with the text descriptions and motion more consistent with the reference videos.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |
| **[Diffusion-Based Image-to-Brain Signal Generation with Cross-Attention Mechanisms for Visual Prostheses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00787v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind individuals. However, while researchers have successfully utilized M/EEG signals to evoke visual perceptions during the brain decoding stage of visual prostheses, the complementary process-converting images to M/EEG signals in the brain encoding stage-remains largely unexplored. Thus, we present the first image-to-brain signal (M/EEG) framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained alignment during the generation process. Furthermore, we evaluate our framework on two multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Additionally, we pioneer the visualization of M/EEG topographies across all subjects in both datasets, providing intuitive demonstrations of intra-subject and inter-subject variations in brain signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemLayoutDiff: Semantic Layout Generation with Diffusion Model for Indoor Scene Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18597v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent, realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/SemLayoutDiff/</p></details> |
| **[Dita: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19757v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent vision-language-action models trained on diverse robot datasets exhibit promising generalization capabilities with limited in-domain data, their reliance on compact action heads to predict discretized or continuous actions constrains adaptability to heterogeneous action spaces. We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning.

| **[Test-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models via Noise Trajectory Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Virtuoso: A Latent Diffusion Transformer Model for Goal-Conditioned Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03658v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems. While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the Efficient Virtuoso, a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, achieving a minimum Average Displacement Error (minADE) of 0.25. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.</p></details> |  |
