| **[Listener-Rewarded Thinking in VLMs for Image Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22832v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model ("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score, shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6% over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here: https://huggingface.co/alexgambashidze/qwen2.5vl_image_preference_reasoner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Epona: Autoregressive Diffusion World Model for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24113v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling. However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning. This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end planners on NAVSIM benchmarks. Code will be publicly available at \href{https://github.com/Kevin-thu/Epona/}{https://github.com/Kevin-thu/Epona/}.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV2...</summary><p>ICCV2025, Project Page: https://kevin-thu.github.io/Epona/</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08438v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in visual domains such as image and video generation. They have also recently emerged as a promising approach in robotics, especially in robot manipulations. Diffusion models leverage a probabilistic framework, and they stand out with their ability to model multi-modal distributions and their robustness to high-dimensional input and output spaces. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art diffusion models in robotic manipulation, including grasp learning, trajectory planning, and data augmentation. Diffusion models for scene and image augmentation lie at the intersection of robotics and computer vision for vision-based tasks to enhance generalizability and data scarcity. This paper also presents the two main frameworks of diffusion models and their integration with imitation learning and reinforcement learning. In addition, it discusses the common architectures and benchmarks and points out the challenges and advantages of current state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 2 figure, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[VMoBA: Mixture-of-Block Attention for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23858v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration, high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for high-res video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VMoBA</p></details> |
| **[RGC-VQA: An Exploration Database for Robotic-Generated Video Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23852v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD), which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos. Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex, robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA models. Our RGCD is publicly available at: https://github.com/IntMeGroup/RGC-VQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynMotion: Semantic-Visual Adaptation for Motion Customized Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23690v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or ''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines.

| **[OmniHuman-1: Rethinking the Scaling-Up of One-Stage Conditioned Human Animation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01061v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end human animation, such as audio-driven talking human generation, has undergone notable advancements in the recent few years. However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals). Video samples are provided on the ttfamily project page (https://omnihuman-lab.github.io)</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Homepage: https://omnihuman-lab.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ViewPoint: Panoramic Video Generation with Pretrained Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23513v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic video generation aims to synthesize 360-degree immersive videos, holding significant importance in the fields of VR, world models, and spatial intelligence. Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data, which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos, achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://becauseimbatman0.github.io/ViewPoint</p></details> |
| **[FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01064v3)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[Causal-Entity Reflected Egocentric Traffic Accident Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23263v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentricly comprehending the causes and effects of car accidents is crucial for the safety of self-driving cars, and synthesizing causal-entity reflected accident videos can facilitate the capability test to respond to unaffordable accidents in reality. However, incorporating causal relations as seen in real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion, Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video generation.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[RoboScape: Physics-informed Embodied World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23135v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence, serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances 3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy training with generated data and policy evaluation. Our work provides new insights for building efficient physics-informed world models to advance embodied intelligence research.

In this report, we introduce Seedance 1.0, a high-performance and inference-efficient video foundation generation model that integrates several core technical improvements: (i) multi-source data curation augmented with precision and meaningful video captioning, enabling comprehensive learning across diverse scenarios; (ii) an efficient architecture design with proposed training paradigm, which allows for natively supporting multi-shot generation and jointly learning of both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. (iii) carefully-optimized post-training approaches leveraging fine-grained supervised fine-tuning, and video-specific RLHF with multi-dimensional reward mechanisms for comprehensive performance improvements; (iv) excellent model acceleration achieving ~10x inference speedup through multi-stage distillation strategies and system-level optimizations. Seedance 1.0 can generate a 5-second video at 1080p resolution only with 41.4 seconds (NVIDIA-L20). Compared to state-of-the-art video generation models, Seedance 1.0 stands out with high-quality and fast video generation having superior spatiotemporal fluidity with structural stability, precise instruction adherence in complex multi-subject contexts, native multi-shot narrative coherence with consistent subject representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Seeda...</summary><p>Seedance 1.0 Technical Report</p></details> |

Although recent methods exhibit strong temporal consistency, they often struggle when dealing with complex, non-repetitive human movements, leading to unnatural deformations. To tackle this issue, we present LatentMove, a DiT-based framework specifically tailored for highly dynamic human animation. Our architecture incorporates a conditional control branch and learnable face/body tokens to preserve consistency as well as fine-grained details across frames. We introduce Complex-Human-Videos (CHV), a dataset featuring diverse, challenging human motions designed to benchmark the robustness of I2V systems. We also introduce two metrics to assess the flow and silhouette consistency of generated videos with their ground truth. Experimental results indicate that LatentMove substantially improves human animation quality--particularly when handling rapid, intricate movements--thereby pushing the boundaries of I2V generation. The code, the CHV dataset, and the evaluation metrics will be available at https://github.com/ --.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors are withdrawing this paper due to major issues in the experiments and methodology.

| **[MimicMotion: High-Quality Human Motion Video Generation with Confidence-aware Pose Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19680v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, generative artificial intelligence has achieved significant advancements in the field of image generation, spawning a variety of applications. However, video generation still faces considerable challenges in various aspects, such as controllability, video length, and richness of details, which hinder the application and popularization of this technology. In this work, we propose a controllable video generation framework, dubbed MimicMotion, which can generate high-quality videos of arbitrary length mimicking specific motion guidance. Compared with previous methods, our approach has several highlights. Firstly, we introduce confidence-aware pose guidance that ensures high frame quality and temporal smoothness. Secondly, we introduce regional loss amplification based on pose confidence, which significantly reduces image distortion. Lastly, for generating long and smooth videos, we propose a progressive latent fusion strategy. By this means, we can produce videos of arbitrary length with acceptable resource consumption. With extensive experiments and user studies, MimicMotion demonstrates significant improvements over previous approaches in various aspects. Detailed results and comparisons are available on our project page: https://tencent.github.io/MimicMotion .</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[DFVEdit: Conditional Delta Flow Vector for Zero-shot Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20967v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at least 20x inference speed-up and 85% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Zero-...</summary><p>Zero-shot video editing</p></details> |
| **[RoboEnvision: A Long-Horizon Video Generation Model for Multi-Task Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22007v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon, leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames, achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on long-horizon tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[ShotBench: Expert-Level Cinematic Understanding in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21356v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding, their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation. This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce ShotBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed (predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60% average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct ShotQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop ShotVL through supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on ShotBench, establishing new state-of-the-art performance. We open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmoothSinger: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Singing Voice Synthesis with Multi-Resolution Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21478v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Singing voice synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive and high-quality vocals from musical scores, requiring precise modeling of pitch, duration, and articulation. While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to the complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in artifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a conditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural singing voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage and often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized audio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated with two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch architecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference to guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware synthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel low-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch contours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during training, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio, addressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals. Experiments on the Opencpop dataset, a large-scale Chinese singing corpus, demonstrate that SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective evaluations. Extensive ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing artifacts and improving the naturalness of synthesized voices.</p></details> |  |
| **[HieraSurg: Hierarchy-Aware Diffusion Model for Surgical Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21287v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation. Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame, HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for practical surgical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Video Virtual Try-on with Conditional Diffusion Transformer Inpainter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21270v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames. Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods, though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task, which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI is superior to previous works.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding.

Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures. Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both visual quality and temporal coherence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Perception Models for 3D Scene Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20601v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability, which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes. Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation, utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse scenarios. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, existing panoramic video generation models struggle to leverage pre-trained generative priors from conventional text-to-video models for high-quality and diverse panoramic videos generation, due to limited dataset scale and the gap in spatial feature representations. In this paper, we introduce PanoWan to effectively lift pre-trained text-to-video models to the panoramic domain, equipped with minimal modules. PanoWan employs latitude-aware sampling to avoid latitudinal distortion, while its rotated semantic denoising and padded pixel-wise decoding ensure seamless transitions at longitude boundaries. To provide sufficient panoramic videos for learning these lifted representations, we contribute PanoVid, a high-quality panoramic video dataset with captions and diverse scenarios. Consequently, PanoWan achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and demonstrates robustness for zero-shot downstream tasks.

| **[BrokenVideos: A Benchmark Dataset for Fine-Grained Artifact Localization in AI-Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20103v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited. Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust. Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs) on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at: https://broken-video-detection-datetsets.github.io/Broken-Video-Detection-Datasets.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 page,4 figures,2 tables</p></details> |

A Comprehensive Survey of World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14499v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of world models has garnered significant attention due to advancements in multimodal large language models such as GPT-4 and video generation models such as Sora, which are central to the pursuit of artificial general intelligence. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the literature on world models. Generally, world models are regarded as tools for either understanding the present state of the world or predicting its future dynamics. This review presents a systematic categorization of world models, emphasizing two primary functions: (1) constructing internal representations to understand the mechanisms of the world, and (2) predicting future states to simulate and guide decision-making. Initially, we examine the current progress in these two categories. We then explore the application of world models in key domains, including autonomous driving, robotics, and social simulacra, with a focus on how each domain utilizes these aspects. Finally, we outline key challenges and provide insights into potential future research directions. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/World-Model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CSUR, 37 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/radial-attention</p></details> |
| **[GenHSI: Controllable Generation of Human-Scene Interaction Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19840v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes (storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images. We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training. Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible human-scene interaction from a single image scene.

| **[SimpleGVR: A Simple Baseline for Latent-Cascaded Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19838v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage available at https://simplegvr.github.io/</p></details> |

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what' together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise, fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance over multiple state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing reward models, designed primarily for real-world videos, fail to capture the unique appearance and consistency requirements of anime. In this work, we propose a pipeline to enhance anime video generation by leveraging human feedback for better alignment. Specifically, we construct the first multi-dimensional reward dataset for anime videos, comprising 30k human-annotated samples that incorporating human preferences for both visual appearance and visual consistency. Based on this, we develop AnimeReward, a powerful reward model that employs specialized vision-language models for different evaluation dimensions to guide preference alignment. Furthermore, we introduce Gap-Aware Preference Optimization (GAPO), a novel training method that explicitly incorporates preference gaps into the optimization process, enhancing alignment performance and efficiency. Extensive experiment results show that AnimeReward outperforms existing reward models, and the inclusion of GAPO leads to superior alignment in both quantitative benchmarks and human evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing anime video quality.

Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing training-free methods, originally designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models. To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality while preserving high efficiency.

Similar results have previously been achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://v-mem.github.io</p></details> |

Unlike prior works focused on game-style visuals, RealPlay aims to produce photorealistic, temporally consistent video sequences that resemble real-world footage. It operates in an interactive loop: users observe a generated scene, issue a control command, and receive a short video chunk in response. To enable such realistic and responsive generation, we address key challenges including iterative chunk-wise prediction for low-latency feedback, temporal consistency across iterations, and accurate control response. RealPlay is trained on a combination of labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos, without requiring real-world action annotations. Notably, we observe two forms of generalization: (1) control transfer-RealPlay effectively maps control signals from virtual to real-world scenarios; and (2) entity transfer-although training labels originate solely from a car racing game, RealPlay generalizes to control diverse real-world entities, including bicycles and pedestrians, beyond vehicles.

However, existing film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and thus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse camera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and unengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end AI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for professional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard outputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography from extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional, audience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles, FilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which transforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage which transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual and auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a Multi-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in generating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a vast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates professional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm Control module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by simulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements to achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models like (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive experiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and cinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://filmaster-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation. MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features, while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction. This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of unified world modeling in robotics.</p></details> |  |

OmniAvatar introduces a pixel-wise multi-hierarchical audio embedding strategy to better capture audio features in the latent space, enhancing lip-syncing across diverse scenes. To preserve the capability for prompt-driven control of foundation models while effectively incorporating audio features, we employ a LoRA-based training approach.

However, existing models still face significant challenges in faithfully following textual instructions. This limitation, commonly known as the copy-paste problem, arises from the widely used in-pair training paradigm. This approach inherently entangles subject identity with background and contextual attributes by sampling reference images from the same scene as the target video. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Phantom-Data, the first general-purpose cross-pair subject-to-video consistency dataset}, containing approximately one million identity-consistent pairs across diverse categories. Our dataset is constructed via a three-stage pipeline: (1) a general and input-aligned subject detection module, (2) large-scale cross-context subject retrieval from more than 53 million videos and 3 billion images, and (3) prior-guided identity verification to ensure visual consistency under contextual variation. Comprehensive experiments show that training with Phantom-Data significantly improves prompt alignment and visual quality while preserving identity consistency on par with in-pair baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page:https://phantom-video.github.io/Phantom-Data/</p></details> |

Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to generate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across diverse game scenarios.

As diffusion models excel in generating realistic videos, reliable content attribution is increasingly critical. However, existing video watermarking methods often introduce distortion by altering the initial distribution of diffusion variables and are vulnerable to temporal attacks, such as frame deletion, due to variable video lengths. VideoMark addresses these challenges by employing a \textbf{pure pseudorandom initialization} to embed watermarks, avoiding distortion while ensuring uniform noise distribution in the latent space to preserve generation quality. To enhance robustness, we adopt a frame-wise watermarking strategy with pseudorandom error correction (PRC) codes, using a fixed watermark sequence with randomly selected starting indices for each video. For watermark extraction, we propose a Temporal Matching Module (TMM) that leverages edit distance to align decoded messages with the original watermark sequence, ensuring resilience against temporal attacks. Experimental results show that VideoMark achieves higher decoding accuracy than existing methods while maintaining video quality comparable to watermark-free generation. The watermark remains imperceptible to attackers without the secret key, offering superior invisibility compared to other frameworks. VideoMark provides a practical, training-free solution for content attribution in diffusion-based video generation.

Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well. Benefiting from the dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO significantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the generated videos. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks and human evaluations have demonstrated that RDPO achieves improvements across multiple dimensions.

In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model. Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite these successes, evaluating the quality of AIGC-generated videos remains challenging due to limited generalization, lack of temporal awareness, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated datasets, and the lack of effective interaction with generation models. Most current approaches rely on supervised finetuning of vision-language models (VLMs), which often require large-scale annotated datasets and tend to decouple understanding and generation. To address these shortcomings, we propose VQ-Insight, a novel reasoning-style VLM framework for AIGC video quality assessment. Our approach features: (1) a progressive video quality learning scheme that combines image quality warm-up, general task-specific temporal learning, and joint optimization with the video generation model; (2) the design of multi-dimension scoring rewards, preference comparison rewards, and temporal modeling rewards to enhance both generalization and specialization in video quality evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VQ-Insight consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in preference comparison, multi-dimension scoring, and natural video scoring, bringing significant improvements for video generation tasks.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Specifically, we propose two key innovations: the HOI-appearance perception, which enhances object appearance recognition from arbitrary multi-view perspectives and disentangles object and human appearance, and the HOI-motion injection, which enables complex human-object interactions by overcoming challenges in object trajectory conditioning and inter-occlusion management. Extensive experiments show that our system improves object appearance preservation by 7.5\% and doubles the object localization accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. It also outperforms existing approaches in maintaining human motion consistency and high-quality video generation.

We introduce DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models. Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/DiffTrack</p></details> |

To better protect individuals, organizations, and societies from its malicious applications, we describe an effective and robust technique for distinguishing real from AI-generated human motion using multi-modal semantic embeddings. Our method is robust to the types of laundering that typically confound more low- to mid-level approaches, including resolution and compression attacks. This method is evaluated against DeepAction, a custom-built, open-sourced dataset of video clips with human actions generated by seven text-to-video AI models and matching real footage. The dataset is available under an academic license at https://www.huggingface.co/datasets/faridlab/deepaction_v1.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SurgSora, a framework that generates high-fidelity, motion-controllable surgical videos from a single input frame and user-specified motion cues. Unlike prior approaches that treat objects indiscriminately or rely on ground-truth segmentation masks, SurgSora leverages self-predicted object features and depth information to refine RGB appearance and optical flow for precise video synthesis. It consists of three key modules: (1) the Dual Semantic Injector, which extracts object-specific RGB-D features and segmentation cues to enhance spatial representations; (2) the Decoupled Flow Mapper, which fuses multi-scale optical flow with semantic features for realistic motion dynamics; and (3) the Trajectory Controller, which estimates sparse optical flow and enables user-guided object movement. By conditioning these enriched features within the Stable Video Diffusion, SurgSora achieves state-of-the-art visual authenticity and controllability in advancing surgical video synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Our human evaluation in collaboration with expert surgeons further demonstrates the high realism of SurgSora-generated videos, highlighting the potential of our method for surgical training and education.

| **[How Far is Video Generation from World Model: A Physical Law Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02385v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OpenAI's Sora highlights the potential of video generation for developing world models that adhere to fundamental physical laws. However, the ability of video generation models to discover such laws purely from visual data without human priors can be questioned. A world model learning the true law should give predictions robust to nuances and correctly extrapolate on unseen scenarios. In this work, we evaluate across three key scenarios: in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and combinatorial generalization. We developed a 2D simulation testbed for object movement and collisions to generate videos deterministically governed by one or more classical mechanics laws. This provides an unlimited supply of data for large-scale experimentation and enables quantitative evaluation of whether the generated videos adhere to physical laws. We trained diffusion-based video generation models to predict object movements based on initial frames. Our scaling experiments show perfect generalization within the distribution, measurable scaling behavior for combinatorial generalization, but failure in out-of-distribution scenarios. Further experiments reveal two key insights about the generalization mechanisms of these models: (1) the models fail to abstract general physical rules and instead exhibit "case-based" generalization behavior, i.e., mimicking the closest training example; (2) when generalizing to new cases, models are observed to prioritize different factors when referencing training data: color > size > velocity > shape. Our study suggests that scaling alone is insufficient for video generation models to uncover fundamental physical laws, despite its role in Sora's broader success.

Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games, ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of interactive game video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hunyuan-gamecraft.github.io/</p></details> |

This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the physical world understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image, and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and, shape and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or complex ray tracing.

However, existing video generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes, and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location, scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

| **[Seeing What Matters: Generalizable AI-generated Video Detection with Forensic-Oriented Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16802v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic video generation is progressing very rapidly. The latest models can produce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually indistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors have been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which limits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to overcome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really matters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on identifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative architecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize a specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative architectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are unbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a novel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet decomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model to exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves the generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for complex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic generators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a single generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of other models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent results even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX. Code and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoGAN-based Trajectory Proposal for Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16209v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Being able to generate realistic trajectory options is at the core of increasing the degree of automation of road vehicles. While model-driven, rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex, multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end, we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training, with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastInit: Fast Noise Initialization for Temporally Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16119v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has made significant strides with the development of diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference. However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement. FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet, we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAROAttention: Pattern-Aware ReOrdering for Efficient Sparse and Quantized Attention in Visual Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16054v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In visual generation, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms results in high memory and computational costs, especially for longer token sequences required in high-resolution image or multi-frame video generation. To address this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and quantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low density and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that the core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of visual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized sparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose an alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the challenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature extraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)** technique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a hardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies and enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the performance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a methodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**, achieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical results from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to **2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://a-suozhang.xyz/paroattn.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Advanced Sign Language Video Generation with Compressed and Quantized Multi-Condition Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15980v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) seeks to generate identity-preserving sign language videos from spoken language texts. Existing methods primarily rely on the single coarse condition (\eg, skeleton sequences) as the intermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model, which limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity. Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions, SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent fine-grained conditions (\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3) Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion Model to guide video generation. Experimental results show that SignViP achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics, including video quality, temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity. The code is available at https://github.com/umnooob/signvip/.</p></details> |  |

It is especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity, multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation.

This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors. VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical laws.

However, their potential for video generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VideoMAR}, a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore, VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings. On the VBench-I2V benchmark, VideoMAR surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (Cosmos I2V) while requiring significantly fewer parameters ($9.3\%$), training data ($0.5\%$), and GPU resources ($0.2\%$).</p></details> |  |

Edits affecting causally dependent attributes risk generating unrealistic or misleading outcomes if these relationships are ignored. In this work, we propose a causally faithful framework for counterfactual video generation, guided by a vision-language model (VLM). Our method is agnostic to the underlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal mechanisms or finetuning. Instead, we guide the generation by optimizing text prompts based on an assumed causal graph, addressing the challenge of latent space control in LDMs. We evaluate our approach using standard video quality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal effectiveness and minimality. Our results demonstrate that causally faithful video counterfactuals can be effectively generated within the learned distribution of LDMs through prompt-based causal steering. With its compatibility with any black-box video editing system, our method holds significant potential for generating realistic "what-if" video scenarios in diverse areas such as healthcare and digital media.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining high-quality data remains challenging, with data privacy issues presenting a significant hurdle. To address the need for high-quality data. Synthesize data has emerged as a mainstream solution, demonstrating impressive performance in areas such as images, audio, and video. Generating mixed-type data, especially high-quality tabular data, still faces significant challenges. These primarily include its inherent heterogeneous data types, complex inter-variable relationships, and intricate column-wise distributions. In this paper, we introduce CausalDiffTab, a diffusion model-based generative model specifically designed to handle mixed tabular data containing both numerical and categorical features, while being more flexible in capturing complex interactions among variables. We further propose a hybrid adaptive causal regularization method based on the principle of Hierarchical Prior Fusion. This approach adaptively controls the weight of causal regularization, enhancing the model's performance without compromising its generative capabilities. Comprehensive experiments conducted on seven datasets demonstrate that CausalDiffTab outperforms baseline methods across all metrics.

Efficient deployment of such generative-AI models on GPUs has been demonstrated with dynamic quantization. However, resource-constrained devices cannot support dynamic quantization, and need static quantization of the models for their efficient deployment on AI processors. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the post-training quantization of OpenSora\cite{opensora}, a Video Diffusion Transformer, without relying on dynamic quantization techniques. Our approach employs static quantization, achieving video quality comparable to FP16 and dynamically quantized ViDiT-Q methods, as measured by CLIP, and VQA metrics. In particular, we utilize per-step calibration data to adequately provide a post-training statically quantized model for each time step, incorporating channel-wise quantization for weights and tensor-wise quantization for activations. By further applying the smooth-quantization technique, we can obtain high-quality video outputs with the statically quantized models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that static quantization can be a viable alternative to dynamic quantization for video diffusion transformers, offering a more efficient approach without sacrificing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MIPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[LARP: Tokenizing Videos with a Learned Autoregressive Generative Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21264v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LARP, a novel video tokenizer designed to overcome limitations in current video tokenization methods for autoregressive (AR) generative models. Unlike traditional patchwise tokenizers that directly encode local visual patches into discrete tokens, LARP introduces a holistic tokenization scheme that gathers information from the visual content using a set of learned holistic queries. This design allows LARP to capture more global and semantic representations, rather than being limited to local patch-level information. Furthermore, it offers flexibility by supporting an arbitrary number of discrete tokens, enabling adaptive and efficient tokenization based on the specific requirements of the task. To align the discrete token space with downstream AR generation tasks, LARP integrates a lightweight AR transformer as a training-time prior model that predicts the next token on its discrete latent space. By incorporating the prior model during training, LARP learns a latent space that is not only optimized for video reconstruction but is also structured in a way that is more conducive to autoregressive generation. Moreover, this process defines a sequential order for the discrete tokens, progressively pushing them toward an optimal configuration during training, ensuring smoother and more accurate AR generation at inference time. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LARP's strong performance, achieving state-of-the-art FVD on the UCF101 class-conditional video generation benchmark. LARP enhances the compatibility of AR models with videos and opens up the potential to build unified high-fidelity multimodal large language models (MLLMs).</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

In this paper, we first propose a high-quality open-sourced UHD-4K (22.4\% of which are 8K) text-to-video dataset named UltraVideo, which contains a wide range of topics (more than 100 kinds), and each video has 9 structured captions with one summarized caption (average of 824 words). Specifically, we carefully design a highly automated curation process with four stages to obtain the final high-quality dataset: \textit{i)} collection of diverse and high-quality video clips. \textit{ii)} statistical data filtering. \textit{iii)} model-based data purification. \textit{iv)} generation of comprehensive, structured captions. In addition, we expand Wan to UltraWan-1K/-4K, which can natively generate high-quality 1K/4K videos with more consistent text controllability, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data curation.We believe that this work can make a significant contribution to future research on UHD video generation.

However, prevailing pipelines are primarily constrained to single-shot creation, while real-world applications urge for multiple shots with identity consistency and flexible content controllability. In this work, we propose EchoShot, a native and scalable multi-shot framework for portrait customization built upon a foundation video diffusion model. To start with, we propose shot-aware position embedding mechanisms within video diffusion transformer architecture to model inter-shot variations and establish intricate correspondence between multi-shot visual content and their textual descriptions. This simple yet effective design enables direct training on multi-shot video data without introducing additional computational overhead. To facilitate model training within multi-shot scenario, we construct PortraitGala, a large-scale and high-fidelity human-centric video dataset featuring cross-shot identity consistency and fine-grained captions such as facial attributes, outfits, and dynamic motions. To further enhance applicability, we extend EchoShot to perform reference image-based personalized multi-shot generation and long video synthesis with infinite shot counts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EchoShot achieves superior identity consistency as well as attribute-level controllability in multi-shot portrait video generation. Notably, the proposed framework demonstrates potential as a foundational paradigm for general multi-shot video modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, generating even longer videos with temporal coherence remains a major challenge and existing length extrapolation methods lead to temporal repetition or motion deceleration. In this work, we systematically analyze the role of frequency components in positional embeddings and identify an intrinsic frequency that primarily governs extrapolation behavior. Based on this insight, we propose RIFLEx, a minimal yet effective approach that reduces the intrinsic frequency to suppress repetition while preserving motion consistency, without requiring any additional modifications. RIFLEx offers a true free lunch--achieving high-quality 2x extrapolation on state-of-the-art video diffusion transformers in a completely training-free manner. Moreover, it enhances quality and enables 3x extrapolation by minimal fine-tuning without long videos. Project page and codes: https://riflex-video.github.io/.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Despite its growing popularity, producing stereoscopic videos remains challenging due to the technical complexities involved in generating stereo parallax. This refers to the positional differences of objects viewed from two distinct perspectives and is crucial for creating depth perception. This complex process poses significant challenges for creators aiming to deliver convincing and engaging presentations. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Text-driven Stereoscopic Video Generation (T-SVG) system. This innovative, model-agnostic, zero-shot approach streamlines video generation by using text prompts to create reference videos. These videos are transformed into 3D point cloud sequences, which are rendered from two perspectives with subtle parallax differences, achieving a natural stereoscopic effect. T-SVG represents a significant advancement in stereoscopic content creation by integrating state-of-the-art, training-free techniques in text-to-video generation, depth estimation, and video inpainting. Its flexible architecture ensures high efficiency and user-friendliness, allowing seamless updates with newer models without retraining. By simplifying the production pipeline, T-SVG makes stereoscopic video generation accessible to a broader audience, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the field.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we present FrameBridge. By modeling the frame-to-frames generation process with a bridge model based data-to-data generative process, we are able to fully exploit the information contained in the given image and improve the consistency between the generation process and I2V task. Moreover, we propose two novel techniques toward the two popular settings of training I2V models, respectively. Firstly, we propose SNR-Aligned Fine-tuning (SAF), making the first attempt to fine-tune a diffusion model to a bridge model and, therefore, allowing us to utilize the pre-trained diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models. Secondly, we propose neural prior, further improving the synthesis quality of FrameBridge when training from scratch. Experiments conducted on WebVid-2M and UCF-101 demonstrate the superior quality of FrameBridge in comparison with the diffusion counterpart (zero-shot FVD 95 vs. 192 on MSR-VTT and non-zero-shot FVD 122 vs. 171 on UCF-101), and the advantages of our proposed SAF and neural prior for bridge-based I2V models.

However, realistic Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) - the complex dynamics between human hands and objects - continues to pose challenges. Generating natural and believable HOI reenactments is difficult due to issues such as occlusion between hands and objects, variations in object shapes and orientations, and the necessity for precise physical interactions, and importantly, the ability to generalize to unseen humans and objects. This paper presents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment generation. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process method, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT) model. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object into the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second stage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions. The key contribution of our method is to reuse the pretrained model's context perception capabilities without introducing additional parameters, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and scenarios, and our proposed paradigm naturally supports long video generation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in challenging real-world scenes, offering enhanced realism and more seamless hand-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, 12 pages</p></details> |

However, it suffers from temporal inconsistency in videos, hindering its practical applications. Various methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue by leveraging video generation models or introducing priors from optical flow and camera poses. Nonetheless, these methods are only applicable to short videos (< 10 seconds) and require a trade-off between quality and computational efficiency. We propose Video Depth Anything for high-quality, consistent depth estimation in super-long videos (over several minutes) without sacrificing efficiency. We base our model on Depth Anything V2 and replace its head with an efficient spatial-temporal head. We design a straightforward yet effective temporal consistency loss by constraining the temporal depth gradient, eliminating the need for additional geometric priors. The model is trained on a joint dataset of video depth and unlabeled images, similar to Depth Anything V2. Moreover, a novel key-frame-based strategy is developed for long video inference. Experiments show that our model can be applied to arbitrarily long videos without compromising quality, consistency, or generalization ability. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video depth estimation. We offer models of different scales to support a range of scenarios, with our smallest model capable of real-time performance at 30 FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://videodepthanything.github.io/</p></details> |

However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations: Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder, based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the generated sign videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Video Editing as Flow-Driven Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07713v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[A Self-supervised Motion Representation for Portrait Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10096v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in portrait video generation have been noteworthy. However, existing methods rely heavily on human priors and pre-trained generative models, Motion representations based on human priors may introduce unrealistic motion, while methods relying on pre-trained generative models often suffer from inefficient inference. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Latent Motion (SeMo), a compact and expressive motion representation. Leveraging this representation, our approach achieve both high-quality visual results and efficient inference. SeMo follows an effective three-step framework: Abstraction, Reasoning, and Generation. First, in the Abstraction step, we use a carefully designed Masked Motion Encoder, which leverages a self-supervised learning paradigm to compress the subject's motion state into a compact and abstract latent motion (1D token). Second, in the Reasoning step, we efficiently generate motion sequences based on the driving audio signal. Finally, in the Generation step, the motion dynamics serve as conditional information to guide the motion decoder in synthesizing realistic transitions from reference frame to target video. Thanks to the compact and expressive nature of Semantic Latent Motion, our method achieves efficient motion representation and high-quality video generation. User studies demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models with an 81% win rate in realism. Extensive experiments further highlight its strong compression capability, reconstruction quality, and generative potential.</p></details> |  |

Empirical studies have demonstrated that real-world data and learning tasks exhibit low-dimensional structures, along with some noise or measurement error. The performance of transformers tends to depend on the intrinsic dimension of the data/tasks, though theoretical understandings remain largely unexplored for transformers. This work establishes a theoretical foundation by analyzing the performance of transformers for regression tasks involving noisy input data on a manifold. Specifically, the input data are in a tubular neighborhood of a manifold, while the ground truth function depends on the projection of the noisy data onto the manifold. We prove approximation and generalization errors which crucially depend on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. Our results demonstrate that transformers can leverage low-complexity structures in learning task even when the input data are perturbed by high-dimensional noise. Our novel proof technique constructs representations of basic arithmetic operations by transformers, which may hold independent interest.</p></details> |  |

Recent video generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision, which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment, which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Despite their robust generative capabilities, these models often struggle with inversion inaccuracies, which could further limit their effectiveness in downstream tasks such as image and video editing. To address this issue, we propose RF-Solver, a novel training-free sampler that effectively enhances inversion precision by mitigating the errors in the ODE-solving process of rectified flow. Specifically, we derive the exact formulation of the rectified flow ODE and apply the high-order Taylor expansion to estimate its nonlinear components, significantly enhancing the precision of ODE solutions at each timestep. Building upon RF-Solver, we further propose RF-Edit, a general feature-sharing-based framework for image and video editing. By incorporating self-attention features from the inversion process into the editing process, RF-Edit effectively preserves the structural information of the source image or video while achieving high-quality editing results. Our approach is compatible with any pre-trained rectified-flow-based models for image and video tasks, requiring no additional training or optimization. Extensive experiments across generation, inversion, and editing tasks in both image and video modalities demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our method.

Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g., text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld</p></details> |  |

However, modeling the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45% compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at 768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism. Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs. Code and models will be publicly available at https://huangjch526.github.io/M4V_project.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unit Enhancement and Guidance Framework for Audio-Driven Avatar Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03603v5)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven human animation technology is widely used in human-computer interaction, and the emergence of diffusion models has further advanced its development. Currently, most methods rely on multi-stage generation and intermediate representations, resulting in long inference time and issues with generation quality in specific foreground regions and audio-motion consistency. These shortcomings are primarily due to the lack of localized fine-grained supervised guidance. To address above challenges, we propose Parts-aware Audio-driven Human Animation, PAHA, a unit enhancement and guidance framework for audio-driven upper-body animation. We introduce two key methods: Parts-Aware Re-weighting (PAR) and Parts Consistency Enhancement (PCE). PAR dynamically adjusts regional training loss weights based on pose confidence scores, effectively improving visual quality. PCE constructs and trains diffusion-based regional audio-visual classifiers to improve the consistency of motion and co-speech audio. Afterwards, we design two novel inference guidance methods for the foregoing classifiers, Sequential Guidance (SG) and Differential Guidance (DG), to balance efficiency and quality respectively. Additionally, we build CNAS, the first public Chinese News Anchor Speech dataset, to advance research and validation in this field. Extensive experimental results and user studies demonstrate that PAHA significantly outperforms existing methods in audio-motion alignment and video-related evaluations. The codes and CNAS dataset will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | revised |

Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision. Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources, GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17 evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data, GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details, such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.</p></details> |  |

While most research focuses on real vs. fake detection, attributing a deep-fake to its specific generation model or encoder is vital for forensic analysis, enabling source tracing and tailored countermeasures. This enhances detection by leveraging model-specific artifacts and supports proactive defenses. We investigate the model attribution problem for deep-fake videos using two datasets: Deepfakes from Different Models (DFDM) and GANGen-Detection, both comprising deep-fake videos and GAN-generated images. We use only fake images from GANGen-Detection to align with DFDM's focus on attribution rather than binary classification. We formulate the task as a multiclass classification problem and introduce a novel Capsule-Spatial-Temporal (CapST) model that integrates a truncated VGG19 network for feature extraction, capsule networks for hierarchical encoding, and a spatio-temporal attention mechanism. Video-level fusion captures temporal dependencies across frames. Experiments on DFDM and GANGen-Detection show CapST outperforms baseline models in attribution accuracy while reducing computational cost.</p></details> |  |

Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme, enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation. Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse scenarios.

Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator (e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones. To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://opendrivelab.com/ReSim</p></details> |

Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |

However, expressive and realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose \textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped. Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a 3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on generation quality.

| **[An Online Learning Approach to Prompt-based Selection of Generative Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13287v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selecting a sample generation scheme from multiple prompt-based generative models, including large language models (LLMs) and prompt-guided image and video generation models, is typically addressed by choosing the model that maximizes an averaged evaluation score. However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types.

| **[Autoregressive Adversarial Post-Training for Real-Time Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09350v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

| **[MagCache: Fast Video Generation with Magnitude-Aware Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09045v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts. Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache) that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zehong-ma.github.io/MagCache</p></details> |

HunyuanVideo-HOMA enhances controllability and reduces dependency on precise inputs through sparse, decoupled motion guidance. It encodes appearance and motion signals into the dual input space of a multimodal diffusion transformer (MMDiT), fusing them within a shared context space to synthesize temporally consistent and physically plausible interactions. To optimize training, we integrate a parameter-space HOI adapter initialized from pretrained MMDiT weights, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient adaptation, and a facial cross-attention adapter for anatomically accurate audio-driven lip synchronization. Extensive experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance in interaction naturalness and generalization under weak supervision. Finally, HunyuanVideo-HOMA demonstrates versatility in text-conditioned generation and interactive object manipulation, supported by a user-friendly demo interface.

| **[From Generation to Generalization: Emergent Few-Shot Learning in Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07280v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools, capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation models in vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 23 figures, 9 tables.

However, existing models often lack robust understanding, limiting their ability to perform multi-step predictions or handle Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose the Reflection of Generation (RoG), a set of intermediate reasoning strategies designed to enhance video prediction. It leverages the complementary strengths of pre-trained vision-language and video generation models, enabling them to function as a world model in embodied scenarios. To support RoG, we introduce Embodied Video Anticipation Benchmark(EVA-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates embodied world models across diverse tasks and scenarios, utilizing both in-domain and OOD datasets. Building on this foundation, we devise a world model, Embodied Video Anticipator (EVA), that follows a multistage training paradigm to generate high-fidelity video frames and apply an autoregressive strategy to enable adaptive generalization for longer video sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of EVA in various downstream tasks like video generation and robotics, thereby paving the way for large-scale pre-trained models in real-world video prediction applications.

| **[ATI: Any Trajectory Instruction for Controllable Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22944v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

While existing kinematics motion generation with diffusion models offer intuitive steering capabilities with inference-time conditioning, they often fail to produce physically viable motions. In contrast, recent diffusion-based control policies have shown promise in generating physically realizable motion sequences, but the lack of kinematics prediction limits their steerability. Diffuse-CLoC addresses these challenges through a key insight: modeling the joint distribution of states and actions within a single diffusion model makes action generation steerable by conditioning it on the predicted states. This approach allows us to leverage established conditioning techniques from kinematic motion generation while producing physically realistic motions. As a result, we achieve planning capabilities without the need for a high-level planner. Our method handles a diverse set of unseen long-horizon downstream tasks through a single pre-trained model, including static and dynamic obstacle avoidance, motion in-betweening, and task-space control. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the traditional hierarchical framework of high-level motion diffusion and low-level tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Guided Latent Diffusion with Predictive Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

| **[Discrete Diffusion in Large Language and Multimodal Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13759v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed. The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment. Paper collection: https://github.com/LiQiiiii/DLLM-Survey</p></details> |  |

In the context of brain MRIs, existing CA approaches rely on supervised contrastive learning or variational autoencoders (VAEs) using both healthy and unhealthy data, but such reliance on target samples is challenging in clinical settings. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) offers an alternative by learning a reference representation of healthy anatomy without the need for target samples. Deviations from this reference distribution can indicate potential anomalies. In this context, diffusion models have been increasingly adopted in UAD due to their superior performance in image generation compared to VAEs. Nonetheless, precisely reconstructing the anatomy of the brain remains a challenge. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework to improve the reconstruction quality by training a self-supervised contrastive encoder on healthy images to extract meaningful anatomical features. These features are used to condition a diffusion model to reconstruct the healthy appearance of a given image, enabling interpretable anomaly localization via pixel-wise comparison. We validate our approach through a proof-of-concept on a facial image dataset and further demonstrate its effectiveness on four brain MRI datasets, achieving state-of-the-art anomaly localization performance on the NOVA benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing Diffusion and State Space Models for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12747v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Rows21/k-Means_Mask_Mamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Minimalist Method for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12036v3)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Contrastive Conditional Latent Diffusion for Audio-visual Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16579v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a contrastive conditional latent diffusion model for audio-visual segmentation (AVS) to thoroughly investigate the impact of audio, where the correlation between audio and the final segmentation map is modeled to guarantee the strong correlation between them. To achieve semantic-correlated representation learning, our framework incorporates a latent diffusion model. The diffusion model learns the conditional generation process of the ground-truth segmentation map, resulting in ground-truth aware inference during the denoising process at the test stage. As our model is conditional, it is vital to ensure that the conditional variable contributes to the model output. We thus extensively model the contribution of the audio signal by minimizing the density ratio between the conditional probability of the multimodal data, e.g. conditioned on the audio-visual data, and that of the unimodal data, e.g. conditioned on the audio data only. In this way, our latent diffusion model via density ratio optimization explicitly maximizes the contribution of audio for AVS, which can then be achieved with contrastive learning as a constraint, where the diffusion part serves as the main objective to achieve maximum likelihood estimation, and the density ratio optimization part imposes the constraint. By adopting this latent diffusion model via contrastive learning, we effectively enhance the contribution of audio for AVS. The effectiveness of our solution is validated through experimental results on the benchmark dataset. Code and results are online via our project page: https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/DiffusionAVS.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, inspired by physical systems, we propose an energy-constrained diffusion model, which integrates the inductive bias of diffusion on manifolds with layer-wise constraints of energy minimization. We identify that the diffusion operators have a one-to-one correspondence with the energy functions implicitly descended by the diffusion process, and the finite-difference iteration for solving the energy-constrained diffusion system induces the propagation layers of various types of MPNNs operating on observed or latent structures. This leads to a unified mathematical framework for common neural architectures whose computational flows can be cast as message passing (or its special case), including MLPs, GNNs, and Transformers. Building on these insights, we devise a new class of neural message passing models, dubbed diffusion-inspired Transformers (DIFFormer), whose global attention layers are derived from the principled energy-constrained diffusion framework. Across diverse datasets ranging from real-world networks to images, texts, and physical particles, we demonstrate that the new model achieves promising performance in scenarios where the data structures are observed (as a graph), partially observed, or entirely unobserved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR).

Incorporating prior information from potential velocity distributions, well-log information, and our geological knowledge and expectations can significantly improve FWI convergence to a realistic model. While diffusion-regularized FWI has shown improved performance compared to conventional FWI by incorporating the velocity distribution prior, it can benefit even more by incorporating well-log information and other geological knowledge priors. To leverage this fact, we propose a geological class and well-information prior-assisted FWI using conditional diffusion models. This method seamlessly integrates multi-modal information into FWI, simultaneously achieving data fitting and universal geologic and geophysics prior matching, which is often not achieved with traditional regularization methods. Specifically, we propose to combine conditional diffusion models with FWI, where we integrate well-log data and geological class conditions into these conditional diffusion models using classifier-free guidance for multi-modal prior matching beyond the original velocity distribution prior. Numerical experiments on the OpenFWI datasets and field marine data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional FWI and the unconditional diffusion-regularized FWI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Duality and Policy Evaluation in Distributionally Robust Bayesian Diffusion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19294v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a Bayesian diffusion control problem of expected terminal utility maximization. The controller imposes a prior distribution on the unknown drift of an underlying diffusion. The Bayesian optimal control, tracking the posterior distribution of the unknown drift, can be characterized explicitly. However, in practice, the prior will generally be incorrectly specified, and the degree of model misspecification can have a significant impact on policy performance. To mitigate this and reduce overpessimism, we introduce a distributionally robust Bayesian control (DRBC) formulation in which the controller plays a game against an adversary who selects a prior in divergence neighborhood of a baseline prior. The adversarial approach has been studied in economics and efficient algorithms have been proposed in static optimization settings. We develop a strong duality result for our DRBC formulation. Combining these results together with tools from stochastic analysis, we are able to derive a loss that can be efficiently trained (as we demonstrate in our numerical experiments) using a suitable neural network architecture. As a result, we obtain an effective algorithm for computing the DRBC optimal strategy. The methodology for computing the DRBC optimal strategy is greatly simplified, as we show, in the important case in which the adversary chooses a prior from a Kullback-Leibler distributional uncertainty set.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Se...</summary><p>In Section 6.2, the real data experiment intends to compare DRBC and DRC with the biased method.

We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (main text), 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Enhanced Controllability of Diffusion Models via Feature Disentanglement and Realism-Enhanced Sampling Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14368v5)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Diffusion Models have shown promising performance, a lot of efforts have been made to improve the controllability of Diffusion Models. However, how to train Diffusion Models to have the disentangled latent spaces and how to naturally incorporate the disentangled conditions during the sampling process have been underexplored. In this paper, we present a training framework for feature disentanglement of Diffusion Models (FDiff). We further propose two sampling methods that can boost the realism of our Diffusion Models and also enhance the controllability. Concisely, we train Diffusion Models conditioned on two latent features, a spatial content mask, and a flattened style embedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the denoising process of Diffusion Models to encode pose/layout information in the content feature and semantic/style information in the style feature. Regarding the sampling methods, we first generalize Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) by breaking the conditional independence assumption to allow for some dependence between conditional inputs, which is shown to be effective in realistic generation in our experiments. Second, we propose timestep-dependent weight scheduling for content and style features to further improve the performance. We also observe better controllability of our proposed methods compared to existing methods in image manipulation and image translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024; Code is available at https://github.com/WonwoongCho/Towards-Enhanced-Controllability-of-Diffusion-Models</p></details> |
| **[Epona: Autoregressive Diffusion World Model for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24113v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling. However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning. This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end planners on NAVSIM benchmarks.

| **[Navigating with Annealing Guidance Scale in Diffusion Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24108v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale, which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation. Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance, offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://annealing-guidance.github.io/annealing-guidance/</p></details> |

Focusing on the task of approximating a target data distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that requires only the order of $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$ score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate scores, where $K$ is an arbitrarily large fixed integer. This result applies to a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases -- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Diffusion-Model-Based PET Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24034v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced as a regularizing prior for PET image reconstruction, integrating DMs trained on high-quality PET images with unsupervised schemes that condition on measured data. While these approaches have potential generalization advantages due to their independence from the scanner geometry and the injected activity level, they forgo the opportunity to explicitly model the interaction between the DM prior and noisy measurement data, potentially limiting reconstruction accuracy. To address this, we propose a supervised DM-based algorithm for PET reconstruction. Our method enforces the non-negativity of PET's Poisson likelihood model and accommodates the wide intensity range of PET images. Through experiments on realistic brain PET phantoms, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms or matches state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods quantitatively across a range of dose levels. We further conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed components in our model, as well as its dependence on training data, parameter count, and number of diffusion steps. Additionally, we show that our approach enables more accurate posterior sampling than unsupervised DM-based methods, suggesting improved uncertainty estimation. Finally, we extend our methodology to a practical approach for fully 3D PET and present example results from real [$^{18}$F]FDG brain PET data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures.

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs. Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.</p></details> | 39 Pages, 7 Figures |

| **[Simultaneous Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Projected Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03607v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models hold significant potential in robotics, enabling the generation of diverse and smooth trajectories directly from raw representations of the environment. Despite this promise, applying diffusion models to motion planning remains challenging due to their difficulty in enforcing critical constraints, such as collision avoidance and kinematic feasibility. These limitations become even more pronounced in Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), where multiple robots must coordinate in shared spaces. To address these challenges, this work proposes Simultaneous MRMP Diffusion (SMD), a novel approach integrating constrained optimization into the diffusion sampling process to produce collision-free, kinematically feasible trajectories. Additionally, the paper introduces a comprehensive MRMP benchmark to evaluate trajectory planning algorithms across scenarios with varying robot densities, obstacle complexities, and motion constraints. Experimental results show SMD consistently outperforms classical and other learning-based motion planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in complex multi-robot environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Forty-Second International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)</p></details> |
| **[VMoBA: Mixture-of-Block Attention for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23858v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration, high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for high-res video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VMoBA</p></details> |
| **[Controllable Reference-Based Real-World Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution with Generative Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23801v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image. To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference, we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference, enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Radioactive Watermarks in Diffusion and Autoregressive Image Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23731v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity. We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile, despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.</p></details> |  |
| **[System-Embedded Diffusion Bridge Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23726v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data. While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates robust generalization under system misspecification between training and deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Subjective Camera: Bridging Human Cognition and Visual Reconstruction through Sequence-Aware Sketch-Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23711v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Subjective Camera, a human-as-imaging-device paradigm that reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions through synergistic use of verbal descriptions and progressive rough sketches. This approach overcomes dual limitations of language ambiguity and sketch abstraction by treating the user's drawing sequence as priors, effectively translating subjective perceptual expectations into photorealistic images. Existing approaches face three fundamental barriers: (1) user-specific subjective input biases, (2) huge modality gap between planar sketch and 3D priors in diffusion, and (3) sketch quality-sensitive performance degradation. Current solutions either demand resource-intensive model adaptation or impose impractical requirements on sketch precision. Our framework addresses these challenges through concept-sequential generation. (1) We establish robust appearance priors through text-reward optimization, and then implement sequence-aware disentangled generation that processes concepts in sketching order; these steps accommodate user-specific subjective expectation in a train-free way. (2) We employ latent optimization that effectively bridges the modality gap between planar sketches and 3D priors in diffusion. (3) Our hierarchical reward-guided framework enables the use of rough sketches without demanding artistic expertise. Comprehensive evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in maintaining both semantic and spatial coherence.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDPG: Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance for MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23701v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is essential in medical diagnostics. As the latest generative models, diffusion models (DMs) have struggled to produce high-fidelity images due to their stochastic nature in image domains. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) yield both compact and detailed prior knowledge in latent domains, which could effectively guide the model towards more effective learning of the original data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance (MDPG) provided by pre-trained LDMs to enhance data consistency in MRI reconstruction tasks. Specifically, we first construct a Visual-Mamba-based backbone, which enables efficient encoding and reconstruction of under-sampled images. Then pre-trained LDMs are integrated to provide conditional priors in both latent and image domains. A novel Latent Guided Attention (LGA) is proposed for efficient fusion in multi-level latent domains. Simultaneously, to effectively utilize a prior in both the k-space and image domain, under-sampled images are fused with generated full-sampled images by the Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for self-adaption guidance. Lastly, to further enhance the data consistency, we propose a k-space regularization strategy based on the non-auto-calibration signal (NACS) set. Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The code is available at https://github.com/Zolento/MDPG.</p></details> | Accept by MICCAI2025 |
| **[MSF: Efficient Diffusion Model Via Multi-Scale Latent Factorize](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13349v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion-based generative models have made significant strides in visual content creation, conventional approaches face computational challenges, especially for high-resolution images, as they denoise the entire image from noisy inputs. This contrasts with signal processing techniques, such as Fourier and wavelet analyses, which often employ hierarchical decompositions. Inspired by such principles, particularly the idea of signal separation, we introduce a diffusion framework leveraging multi-scale latent factorization. Our framework uniquely decomposes the denoising target, typically latent features from a pretrained Variational Autoencoder, into a low-frequency base signal capturing core structural information and a high-frequency residual signal that contributes finer, high-frequency details like textures. This decomposition into base and residual components directly informs our two-stage image generation process, which first produces the low-resolution base, followed by the generation of the high-resolution residual. Our proposed architecture facilitates reduced sampling steps during the residual learning stage, owing to the inherent ease of modeling residual information, which confers advantages over conventional full-resolution generation techniques. This specific approach of decomposing the signal into a base and a residual, conceptually akin to how wavelet analysis can separate different frequency bands, yields a more streamlined and intuitive design distinct from generic hierarchical models. Our method, \name\ (Multi-Scale Factorization), demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving FID scores of 2.08 ($256\times256$) and 2.47 ($512\times512$) on class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks, outperforming the DiT baseline (2.27 and 3.04 respectively) while also delivering a $4\times$ speed-up with the same number of sampling steps.</p></details> |  |

In addition, labeling requires costly, time-intensive manual image annotation by clinical experts. To overcome these challenges, synthetic medical data generation offers a promising solution. Generative AI (GenAI), employing generative deep learning models, has proven effective at producing realistic synthetic images. This study proposes a novel mask-guided GenAI approach using diffusion models to generate synthetic fetal head ultrasound images paired with segmentation masks. These synthetic pairs augment real datasets for supervised fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our results show that the synthetic data captures real image features effectively, and this approach reaches state-of-the-art fetal head segmentation, especially when trained with a limited number of real image-mask pairs. In particular, the segmentation reaches Dice Scores of 94.66\% and 94.38\% using a handful of ultrasound images from the Spanish and African cohorts, respectively.

In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts) into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving 100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios: each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome. These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> |

By enabling flexible object manipulation, this synthesis approach can significantly enrich training datasets and enhance discriminative models. However, existing methods focus on unconditional lidar point cloud generation, overlooking their potential for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose SG-LDM, a Semantic-Guided Lidar Diffusion Model that employs latent alignment to enable robust semantic-to-lidar synthesis. By directly operating in the native lidar space and leveraging explicit semantic conditioning, SG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity lidar point clouds guided by semantic labels. Moreover, we propose the first diffusion-based lidar translation framework based on SG-LDM, which enables cross-domain translation as a domain adaptation strategy to enhance downstream perception performance. Systematic experiments demonstrate that SG-LDM significantly outperforms existing lidar diffusion models and the proposed lidar translation framework further improves data augmentation performance in the downstream lidar segmentation task.</p></details> |  |

These challenges hinder applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data. In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information, and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns, boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID and LPIPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning for Remote Sensing (ML4RS)</p></details> |

However, we argue that video depth estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints. Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis, highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance, showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done in Nov 2024, during an internship at the University of Pennsylvania.

| **[Disentangled Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04444v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based methods for monocular 3D human pose estimation have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance by directly regressing the 3D joint coordinates from the 2D pose sequence. Although some methods decompose the task into bone length and bone direction prediction based on the human anatomical skeleton to explicitly incorporate more human body prior constraints, the performance of these methods is significantly lower than that of the SOTA diffusion-based methods. This can be attributed to the tree structure of the human skeleton. Direct application of the disentangled method could amplify the accumulation of hierarchical errors, propagating through each hierarchy. Meanwhile, the hierarchical information has not been fully explored by the previous methods. To address these problems, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser is proposed, termed DDHPose. In our approach: (1) We disentangle the 3D pose and diffuse the bone length and bone direction during the forward process of the diffusion model to effectively model the human pose prior. A disentanglement loss is proposed to supervise diffusion model learning. (2) For the reverse process, we propose Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser (HSTDenoiser) to improve the hierarchical modeling of each joint. Our HSTDenoiser comprises two components: the Hierarchical-Related Spatial Transformer (HRST) and the Hierarchical-Related Temporal Transformer (HRTT). HRST exploits joint spatial information and the influence of the parent joint on each joint for spatial modeling, while HRTT utilizes information from both the joint and its hierarchical adjacent joints to explore the hierarchical temporal correlations among joints.

| **[Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00361v4)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have achieved superior performance in imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their rich expressiveness. However, the conventional diffusion training procedure requires samples from target distribution, which is impossible in online RL since we cannot sample from the optimal policy. Backpropagating policy gradient through the diffusion process incurs huge computational costs and instability, thus being expensive and not scalable. To enable efficient training of diffusion policies in online RL, we generalize the conventional denoising score matching by reweighting the loss function. The resulting Reweighted Score Matching (RSM) preserves the optimal solution and low computational cost of denoising score matching, while eliminating the need to sample from the target distribution and allowing learning to optimize value functions. We introduce two tractable reweighted loss functions to solve two commonly used policy optimization problems, policy mirror descent and max-entropy policy, resulting in two practical algorithms named Diffusion Policy Mirror Descent (DPMD) and Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic (SDAC). We conducted comprehensive comparisons on MuJoCo benchmarks. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform recent diffusion-policy online RLs on most tasks, and the DPMD improves more than 120% over soft actor-critic on Humanoid and Ant.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

While recent diffusion-based view synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image, they typically assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object are occluded, resulting in degraded 3D reconstruction quality. We propose DeOcc-1-to-3, an end-to-end framework for occlusion-aware multi-view generation that synthesizes six structurally consistent novel views directly from a single occluded image, enabling reliable 3D reconstruction without prior inpainting or manual annotations. Our self-supervised training pipeline leverages occluded-unoccluded image pairs and pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware reconstruction, covering diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and masking patterns, providing a standardized protocol for future evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: \url{https://quyans.github.io/DeOcc123/}</p></details> |

As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. Among these, watermarking methods capable of preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention. However, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing applications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new demands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks remains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process, necessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid iteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making proactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks. To address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results indicate that TAG-WM achieves SOTA tampering robustness and tampering localization capability with distortions while maintaining lossless generation quality and a considerable capacity of 256 bits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 (2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision)</p></details> |

However, existing inpainting methods often suffer from problems such as semantic misalignment, structural distortion, and style inconsistency. In this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss using a pre-trained VGG network and the Gram matrix. Comprehensive evaluations on BrushBench and EditBench demonstrate that MTADiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[FD-DiT: Frequency Domain-Directed Diffusion Transformer for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23466v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but suffers from image artifacts and loss of detail due to quantum and electronic noise, potentially impacting diagnostic accuracy. Transformer combined with diffusion models has been a promising approach for image generation. Nevertheless, existing methods exhibit limitations in preserving finegrained image details. To address this issue, frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer (FD-DiT) is proposed for LDCT reconstruction. FD-DiT centers on a diffusion strategy that progressively introduces noise until the distribution statistically aligns with that of LDCT data, followed by denoising processing. Furthermore, we employ a frequency decoupling technique to concentrate noise primarily in high-frequency domain, thereby facilitating effective capture of essential anatomical structures and fine details. A hybrid denoising network is then utilized to optimize the overall data reconstruction process. To enhance the capability in recognizing high-frequency noise, we incorporate sliding sparse local attention to leverage the sparsity and locality of shallow-layer information, propagating them via skip connections for improving feature representation. Finally, we propose a learnable dynamic fusion strategy for optimal component integration. Experimental results demonstrate that at identical dose levels, LDCT images reconstructed by FD-DiT exhibit superior noise and artifact suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 11pages, 11 figures |
| **[Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features for Weakly Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23460v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However, traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling and Mitigating Memorization in Text-to-image Diffusion Models through Cross Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11052v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated their remarkable capability to generate high-quality images from textual prompts. However, increasing research indicates that these models memorize and replicate images from their training data, raising tremendous concerns about potential copyright infringement and privacy risks. In our study, we provide a novel perspective to understand this memorization phenomenon by examining its relationship with cross-attention mechanisms. We reveal that during memorization, the cross-attention tends to focus disproportionately on the embeddings of specific tokens. The diffusion model is overfitted to these token embeddings, memorizing corresponding training images. To elucidate this phenomenon, we further identify and discuss various intrinsic findings of cross-attention that contribute to memorization. Building on these insights, we introduce an innovative approach to detect and mitigate memorization in diffusion models. The advantage of our proposed method is that it will not compromise the speed of either the training or the inference processes in these models while preserving the quality of generated images.

| **[Efficient Diffusion Training through Parallelization with Truncated Karhunen-Loève Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17657v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion denoising models have become a popular approach for image generation, but they often suffer from slow convergence during training. In this paper, we identify that this slow convergence is partly due to the complexity of the Brownian motion driving the forward-time process. To address this, we represent the Brownian motion using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, truncating it to a limited number of eigenfunctions. We propose a novel ordinary differential equation with augmented random initials, termed KL diffusion, as a new forward-time process for training and sampling. By developing an appropriate denoising loss function, we facilitate the integration of our KL-diffusion into existing denoising-based models. Using the widely adopted DDIM framework as our baseline ensures a fair comparison, as our modifications focus solely on the forward process and loss function, leaving the network architecture and sampling methods unchanged. Our method significantly outperforms baseline diffusion models, achieving convergence speeds that are twice faster to reach the best FID score of the baseline and ultimately yielding much lower FID scores. Notably, our approach allows for highly parallelized computation, requires no additional learnable parameters, and can be flexibly integrated into existing diffusion methods. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[When Additive Noise Meets Unobserved Mediators: Bivariate Denoising Diffusion for Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23374v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distinguishing cause and effect from bivariate observational data is a foundational problem in many disciplines, but challenging without additional assumptions. Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable sample-efficient bivariate causal discovery. However, conventional ANM-based methods fail when unobserved mediators corrupt the causal relationship between variables. This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously characterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of unmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden mediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical utility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD) for causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by unmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through mean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel independence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for each variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the independence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic consistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under hidden mediation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate consistent performance, outperforming existing methods in mediator-corrupted settings while maintaining strong performance in mediator-free settings.</p></details> |  |

These unknown covariate shifts present significant challenges to deep learning based methods trained on "clean" images. This often results in unreliable predictions and poorly calibrated confidence, hence hindering clinical applicability. While recent methods have been developed to address specific issues such as confidence calibration or adversarial robustness, no single framework effectively tackles all these challenges simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose LaDiNE, a novel ensemble learning method combining the robustness of Vision Transformers with diffusion-based generative models for improved reliability in medical image classification. Specifically, transformer encoder blocks are used as hierarchical feature extractors that learn invariant features from images for each ensemble member, resulting in features that are robust to input perturbations. In addition, diffusion models are used as flexible density estimators to estimate member densities conditioned on the invariant features, leading to improved modeling of complex data distributions while retaining properly calibrated confidence. Extensive experiments on tuberculosis chest X-rays and melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that LaDiNE achieves superior performance compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art methods by simultaneously improving prediction accuracy and confidence calibration under unseen noise, adversarial perturbations, and resolution degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2025</p></details> |

This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional Constant Bitrate Streaming (CBS) and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While retaining B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to support efficient refinement of video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework further incorporates state-of-the-art denoising and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Wireless Communications</p></details> |

| **[Overcoming Dimensional Factorization Limits in Discrete Diffusion Models through Quantum Joint Distribution Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05151v3)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models represent a significant advance in generative modeling, demonstrating remarkable success in synthesizing complex, high-quality discrete data. However, to avoid exponential computational costs, they typically rely on calculating per-dimension transition probabilities when learning high-dimensional distributions. In this study, we rigorously prove that this approach leads to a worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces, offering a theoretical pathway to faithfully capture the true joint distribution. By deriving posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit that utilizes temporal information for parameter sharing and incorporates learnable classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise, eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage in joint distribution learning.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |
| **[Hierarchical Quantized Diffusion Based Tree Generation Method for Hierarchical Representation and Lineage Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23287v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In single-cell research, tracing and analyzing high-throughput single-cell differentiation trajectories is crucial for understanding complex biological processes. Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that represents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face limitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity, and stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing these challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree branch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based approach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a hierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized diffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves stability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative capacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion process. HDTree's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons on both general-purpose and single-cell datasets, where it outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and performance. These contributions provide a new tool for hierarchical lineage analysis, enabling more accurate and efficient modeling of cellular differentiation paths and offering insights for downstream biological tasks.

However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover, performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints, limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion via latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for unseen object classes.</p></details> |  |

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining provides protein-targeted staining but is restricted by tissue availability and antibody specificity. Virtual staining, i.e., computationally translating the H&E image to its IHC counterpart while preserving the tissue structure, is promising for efficient IHC generation. Existing virtual staining methods still face key challenges: 1) effective decomposition of staining style and tissue structure, 2) controllable staining process adaptable to diverse tissue and proteins, and 3) rigorous structural consistency modelling to handle the non-pixel-aligned nature of paired H&E and IHC images. This study proposes a mutual-information (MI)-guided score-based diffusion model for unpaired virtual staining. Specifically, we design 1) a global MI-guided energy function that disentangles the tissue structure and staining characteristics across modalities, 2) a novel timestep-customized reverse diffusion process for precise control of the staining intensity and structural reconstruction, and 3) a local MI-driven contrastive learning strategy to ensure the cellular level structural consistency between H&E-IHC images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its biomedical potential.

However, it remains challenging to produce perpetually realistic, view-consistent, and temporally coherent human avatars from a single image, as limited information is available in the single-view input setting. Motivated by the success of 2D character animation, we propose HumanGif, a single-view human diffusion model with generative prior. Specifically, we formulate the single-view-based 3D human novel view and pose synthesis as a single-view-conditioned human diffusion process, utilizing generative priors from foundational diffusion models to complement the missing information. To ensure fine-grained and consistent novel view and pose synthesis, we introduce a Human NeRF module in HumanGif to learn spatially aligned features from the input image, implicitly capturing the relative camera and human pose transformation. Furthermore, we introduce an image-level loss during optimization to bridge the gap between latent and image spaces in diffusion models. Extensive experiments on RenderPeople, DNA-Rendering, THuman 2.1, and TikTok datasets demonstrate that HumanGif achieves the best perceptual performance, with better generalizability for novel view and pose synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://skhu101.github.io/HumanGif/</p></details> |
| **[Incomplete Multi-view Clustering via Diffusion Contrastive Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09185v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to the common issue of missing data in multi-view datasets. The primary approach to address this challenge involves recovering the missing views before applying conventional multi-view clustering methods. Although imputation-based IMVC methods have achieved significant improvements, they still encounter notable limitations: 1) heavy reliance on paired data for training the data recovery module, which is impractical in real scenarios with high missing data rates; 2) the generated data often lacks diversity and discriminability, resulting in suboptimal clustering results. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel IMVC method called Diffusion Contrastive Generation (DCG). Motivated by the consistency between the diffusion and clustering processes, DCG learns the distribution characteristics to enhance clustering by applying forward diffusion and reverse denoising processes to intra-view data. By performing contrastive learning on a limited set of paired multi-view samples, DCG can align the generated views with the real views, facilitating accurate recovery of views across arbitrary missing view scenarios. Additionally, DCG integrates instance-level and category-level interactive learning to exploit the consistent and complementary information available in multi-view data, achieving robust and end-to-end clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangyuanyang21/2025-AAAI-DCG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Diffusion Models to Synthesize Full-dose FDG Brain PET from MRI in Epilepsy Patients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11297v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.</p></details> |  |

Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score (CRPS).</p></details> |  |

This work introduces AugPaint, a data augmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs from limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known for their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead, and adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for retraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the area labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising process for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled in, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach ensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting it apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve as valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models, effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted extensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical image segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results across all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art label-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation performance.</p></details> |  |

The method is capable of improving the order of approximation for non-smooth problems. By following a similar approach to the one presented in [9], we present a damped block Newton (dBN) method to achieve nearly optimal order of approximation. The dBN method optimizes the Ritz functional by alternating between the linear and non-linear parameters of the shallow ReLU neural network (NN). For diffusion-reaction problems, new difficulties arise: (1) for the linear parameters, the mass matrix is dense and even more ill-conditioned than the stiffness matrix, and (2) for the non-linear parameters, the Hessian matrix is dense and may be singular. This paper addresses these challenges, resulting in a dBN method with computational cost of ${\cal O}(n)$. The ideas presented for diffusion-reaction problems can also be applied to least-squares approximation problems. For both applications, starting with the non-linear parameters as a uniform partition, numerical experiments show that the dBN method moves the mesh points to nearly optimal locations.</p></details> |  |

While current diffusion models have shown promise in image segmentation, they are inadequate when applied directly to brain MRI due to neglecting anatomical information. To address this, we propose Collaborative Anatomy Diffusion (CA-Diff), a framework integrating spatial anatomical features to enhance segmentation accuracy of the diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce distance field as an auxiliary anatomical condition to provide global spatial context, alongside a collaborative diffusion process to model its joint distribution with anatomical structures, enabling effective utilization of anatomical features for segmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a consistency loss to refine relationships between the distance field and anatomical structures and design a time adapted channel attention module to enhance the U-Net feature fusion procedure. Extensive experiments show that CA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | ICME 2025 |

Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work, we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding \emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts.

Although contemporary 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases, thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS. (Camera-ready version incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon.)</p></details> |  |
| **[Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for Tunable Metalens Photography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22753v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography, leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sculpting Memory: Multi-Concept Forgetting in Diffusion Models via Dynamic Mask and Concept-Aware Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09039v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. However, their ability to store vast amounts of knowledge raises concerns in scenarios where selective forgetting is necessary, such as removing copyrighted content, reducing biases, or eliminating harmful concepts. While existing unlearning methods can remove certain concepts, they struggle with multi-concept forgetting due to instability, residual knowledge persistence, and generation quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Dynamic Mask coupled with Concept-Aware Loss}, a novel unlearning framework designed for multi-concept forgetting in diffusion models. Our \textbf{Dynamic Mask} mechanism adaptively updates gradient masks based on current optimization states, allowing selective weight modifications that prevent interference with unrelated knowledge. Additionally, our \textbf{Concept-Aware Loss} explicitly guides the unlearning process by enforcing semantic consistency through superclass alignment, while a regularization loss based on knowledge distillation ensures that previously unlearned concepts remain forgotten during sequential unlearning. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unlearning techniques in forgetting effectiveness, output fidelity, and semantic coherence, particularly in multi-concept scenarios. Our work provides a principled and flexible framework for stable and high-fidelity unlearning in generative models. The code will be released publicly.</p></details> | ICCV2025(Accept) |

Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object. We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch, balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on 3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights for visual perception tasks across diverse domains.

| **[High-Precision Dichotomous Image Segmentation via Probing Diffusion Capacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10105v3)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of high-resolution (HR), fine-grained image segmentation, the primary challenge is balancing broad contextual awareness with the precision required for detailed object delineation, capturing intricate details and the finest edges of objects. Diffusion models, trained on vast datasets comprising billions of image-text pairs, such as SD V2.1, have revolutionized text-to-image synthesis by delivering exceptional quality, fine detail resolution, and strong contextual awareness, making them an attractive solution for high-resolution image segmentation. To this end, we propose DiffDIS, a diffusion-driven segmentation model that taps into the potential of the pre-trained U-Net within diffusion models, specifically designed for high-resolution, fine-grained object segmentation. By leveraging the robust generalization capabilities and rich, versatile image representation prior of the SD models, coupled with a task-specific stable one-step denoising approach, we significantly reduce the inference time while preserving high-fidelity, detailed generation. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary edge generation task to not only enhance the preservation of fine details of the object boundaries, but reconcile the probabilistic nature of diffusion with the deterministic demands of segmentation. With these refined strategies in place, DiffDIS serves as a rapid object mask generation model, specifically optimized for generating detailed binary maps at high resolutions, while demonstrating impressive accuracy and swift processing. Experiments on the DIS5K dataset demonstrate the superiority of DiffDIS, achieving state-of-the-art results through a streamlined inference process.

| **[PriorDiffusion: Leverage Language Prior in Diffusion Models for Monocular Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16750v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional monocular depth estimation suffers from inherent ambiguity and visual nuisance. We argue that language prior can enhance monocular depth estimation by leveraging the inductive bias learned during the text-to-image pre-training of diffusion models. The ability of these models to generate images that align with text indicates that they have learned the spatial relationships, size, and shape of specified objects, which can be applied to improve depth estimation. Thus, we propose PriorDiffusion, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that takes both images and corresponding text descriptions to infer affine-invariant depth through a denoising process. We also show that language prior enhances the model's perception of specific regions of images that users care about and describe. Simultaneously, language prior acts as a constraint to accelerate the convergence of both training and the inference diffusion trajectory. By training on HyperSim and Virtual KITTI, we achieve faster training convergence, fewer inference diffusion steps, and state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across NYUv2, KITTI, ETH3D, and ScanNet. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Shallow Ritz Method For 1D Diffusion Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17750v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the shallow Ritz method for solving the one-dimensional diffusion problem. It is shown that the shallow Ritz method improves the order of approximation dramatically for non-smooth problems. To realize this optimal or nearly optimal order of the shallow Ritz approximation, we develop a damped block Newton (dBN) method that alternates between updates of the linear and non-linear parameters. Per each iteration, the linear and the non-linear parameters are updated by exact inversion and one step of a modified, damped Newton method applied to a reduced non-linear system, respectively. The computational cost of each dBN iteration is $O(n)$. Starting with the non-linear parameters as a uniform partition of the interval, numerical experiments show that the dBN is capable of efficiently moving mesh points to nearly optimal locations. To improve efficiency of the dBN further, we propose an adaptive damped block Newton (AdBN) method by combining the dBN with the adaptive neuron enhancement (ANE) method [26].</p></details> |  |
| **[CaO$_2$: Rectifying Inconsistencies in Diffusion-Based Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22637v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large, high-resolution target datasets, offering improved efficiency and performance over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1) Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood. CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets, surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[Enhancing Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems by Integrating Crafted Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09850v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful foundation model for visual generations. With an appropriate sampling process, it can effectively serve as a generative prior for solving general inverse problems. Current posterior sampling-based methods take the measurement (i.e., degraded image sample) into the posterior sampling to infer the distribution of the target data (i.e., clean image sample). However, in this manner, we show that high-frequency information can be prematurely introduced during the early stages, which could induce larger posterior estimate errors during restoration sampling. To address this observation, we first reveal that forming the log-posterior gradient with the noisy measurement ( i.e., noisy measurement from a diffusion forward process) instead of the clean one can benefit the early posterior sampling. Consequently, we propose a novel diffusion posterior sampling method DPS-CM, which incorporates a Crafted Measurement (i.e., noisy measurement crafted by a reverse denoising process, rather than constructed from the diffusion forward process) to form the posterior estimate. This integration aims to mitigate the misalignment with the diffusion prior caused by cumulative posterior estimate errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the overall capacity to solve general and noisy inverse problems, such as Gaussian deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, nonlinear deblurring, and tasks with Poisson noise, relative to existing approaches.

| **[Diffusion-Based Surrogate Modeling and Multi-Fidelity Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17720v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics simulations have become fundamental tools to study myriad engineering systems. As physics simulations often involve simplifications, their outputs should be calibrated using real-world data. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based surrogate (DBS) that calibrates multi-fidelity physics simulations with diffusion generative processes. DBS categorizes multi-fidelity physics simulations into inexpensive and expensive simulations, depending on the computational costs. The inexpensive simulations, which can be obtained with low latency, directly inject contextual information into diffusion models. Furthermore, when results from expensive simulations are available, \name refines the quality of generated samples via a guided diffusion process. This design circumvents the need for large amounts of expensive physics simulations to train denoising diffusion models, thus lending flexibility to practitioners. DBS builds on Bayesian probabilistic models and is equipped with a theoretical guarantee that provides upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance between the sample and underlying true distribution. The probabilistic nature of DBS also provides a convenient approach for uncertainty quantification in prediction. Our models excel in cases where physics simulations are imperfect and sometimes inaccessible. We use a numerical simulation in fluid dynamics and a case study in laser-based metal powder deposition additive manufacturing to demonstrate how DBS calibrates multi-fidelity physics simulations with observations to obtain surrogates with superior predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffSoundStream: Efficient Speech Tokenization via Diffusion Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22362v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token-based language modeling is a prominent approach for speech generation, where tokens are obtained by quantizing features from self-supervised learning (SSL) models and extracting codes from neural speech codecs, generally referred to as semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. These tokens are often modeled autoregressively, with the inference speed being constrained by the token rate. In this work, we propose DiffSoundStream, a solution that improves the efficiency of speech tokenization in non-streaming scenarios through two techniques: (1) conditioning the neural codec on semantic tokens to minimize redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens, and (2) leveraging latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality waveforms from semantic and coarse-level acoustic tokens. Experiments show that at 50 tokens per second, DiffSoundStream achieves speech quality on par with a standard SoundStream model operating at twice the token rate. Additionally, we achieve step-size distillation using just four diffusion sampling steps with only a minor quality loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[OutDreamer: Video Outpainting with a Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22298v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs) have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance. We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content, ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent Diffusion Model for Compressed Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07381v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to storage and bandwidth limitations, videos transmitted over the Internet often exhibit low quality, characterized by low-resolution and compression artifacts. Although video super-resolution (VSR) is an efficient video enhancing technique, existing VSR methods focus less on compressed videos. Consequently, directly applying general VSR approaches fails to improve practical videos with compression artifacts, especially when frames are highly compressed at a low bit rate. The inevitable quantization information loss complicates the reconstruction of texture details. Recently, diffusion models have shown superior performance in low-level visual tasks. Leveraging the high-realism generation capability of diffusion models, we propose a novel method that exploits the priors of pre-trained diffusion models for compressed VSR. To mitigate spatial distortions and refine temporal consistency, we introduce a Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent (SDATC) diffusion model. Specifically, we incorporate a distortion control module (DCM) to modulate diffusion model inputs, thereby minimizing the impact of noise from low-quality frames on the generation stage. Subsequently, the diffusion model performs a denoising process to generate details, guided by a fine-tuned compression-aware prompt module (CAPM) and a spatio-temporal attention module (STAM). CAPM dynamically encodes compression-related information into prompts, enabling the sampling process to adapt to different degradation levels. Meanwhile, STAM extends the spatial attention mechanism into the spatio-temporal dimension, effectively capturing temporal correlations. Additionally, we utilize optical flow-based alignment during each denoising step to enhance the smoothness of output videos. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules in restoring compressed videos.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Federated Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness, semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve the generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse CT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion models have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT) reconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT image noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior information from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed NEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain. First, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection data, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT projections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine reconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions to more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction fidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain reconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be effectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time step matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and segmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and generalization performance.

Diffusion-based image editing approaches capitalized on the deep understanding of diffusion models of image semantics to perform a variety of edits. However, existing diffusion models lack sufficient understanding of many object parts, hindering fine-grained edits requested by users. To address this, we propose to expand the knowledge of pre-trained diffusion models to allow them to understand various object parts, enabling them to perform fine-grained edits. We achieve this by learning special textual tokens that correspond to different object parts through an efficient token optimization process. These tokens are optimized to produce reliable localization masks at each inference step to localize the editing region. Leveraging these masks, we design feature-blending and adaptive thresholding strategies to execute the edits seamlessly. To evaluate our approach, we establish a benchmark and an evaluation protocol for part editing. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing editing methods on all metrics and is preferred by users 66-90% of the time in conducted user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025 (Conference Track).

| **[StableCodec: Taming One-Step Diffusion for Extreme Image Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21977v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based image compression has shown remarkable potential for achieving ultra-low bitrate coding (less than 0.05 bits per pixel) with high realism, by leveraging the generative priors of large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches require a large number of denoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme bitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression scenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity, as diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step diffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with improved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an efficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent representation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a Dual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and decoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end optimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints. Extensive experiments on the CLIC 2020, DIV2K, and Kodak dataset demonstrate that StableCodec outperforms existing methods in terms of FID, KID and DISTS by a significant margin, even at bitrates as low as 0.005 bits per pixel, while maintaining strong fidelity. Additionally, StableCodec achieves inference speeds comparable to mainstream transform coding schemes. All source code are available at https://github.com/LuizScarlet/StableCodec.</p></details> |  |

In such systems, task offloading and resource allocation encounter multiple challenges, including node heterogeneity, unstable communication links, and dynamic task variations. To address these issues, this paper constructs a three-layer heterogeneous MEC system architecture for low-altitude economic networks, encompassing aerial and ground users as well as edge servers. The system is systematically modeled from the perspectives of communication channels, computational costs, and constraint conditions, and the joint optimization problem of offloading decisions and resource allocation is uniformly abstracted into a graph-structured modeling task. On this basis, we propose a graph attention diffusion-based solution generator (GADSG). This method integrates the contextual awareness of graph attention networks with the solution distribution learning capability of diffusion models, enabling joint modeling and optimization of discrete offloading variables and continuous resource allocation variables within a high-dimensional latent space. We construct multiple simulation datasets with varying scales and topologies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GADSG model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of optimization performance, robustness, and generalization across task structures, showing strong potential for efficient task scheduling in dynamic and complex low-altitude economic network environments.</p></details> |  |
