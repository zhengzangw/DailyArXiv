| **[Unified Video Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00200v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified video and action model holds significant promise for robotics, where videos provide rich scene information for action prediction, and actions provide dynamics information for video prediction. However, effectively combining video generation and action prediction remains challenging, and current video generation-based methods struggle to match the performance of direct policy learning in action accuracy and inference speed. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified Video Action model (UVA), which jointly optimizes video and action predictions to achieve both high accuracy and efficient action inference. The key lies in learning a joint video-action latent representation and decoupling video-action decoding. The joint latent representation bridges the visual and action domains, effectively modeling the relationship between video and action sequences. Meanwhile, the decoupled decoding, powered by two lightweight diffusion heads, enables high-speed action inference by bypassing video generation during inference. Such a unified framework further enables versatile functionality through masked input training. By selectively masking actions or videos, a single model can tackle diverse tasks beyond policy learning, such as forward and inverse dynamics modeling and video generation. Via an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that UVA can serve as a general-purpose solution for a wide range of robotics tasks, such as policy learning, forward/inverse dynamics and video observation prediction, without compromising performance compared to methods tailored for specific applications.

| **[Generative Artificial Intelligence-Guided User Studies: An Application for Air Taxi Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12296v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User studies are crucial for meeting user needs. In user studies, real experimental scenarios and participants are constructed and recruited. However, emerging and unfamiliar studies face limitations, including safety concerns and iterative efficiency. To address these challenges, this study utilises a Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to create GenAI-generated scenarios for user experience (UX). By recruiting real users to evaluate this experience, we can collect feedback that enables rapid iteration in the early design phase. The air taxi is particularly representative of these challenges and has been chosen as the case study for this research. The key contribution was designing an Air Taxi Journey (ATJ) using Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI image and video generators. Based on the GPT-4-generated scripts, key visuals were created for the air taxi, and the ATJ was evaluated by 72 participants. Furthermore, the LLMs demonstrated the ability to identify and suggest environments that significantly improve participants' willingness toward air taxis. Education level and gender significantly influenced participants' the difference in willingness and their satisfaction with the ATJ. Satisfaction with the ATJ serves as a mediator, significantly influencing participants' willingness to take air taxis. Our study confirms the capability of GenAI to support user studies, providing a feasible approach and valuable insights for designing air taxi UX in the early design phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 main figures, 10 appendix figures</p></details> |
| **[GRADEO: Towards Human-Like Evaluation for Text-to-Video Generation via Multi-Step Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02341v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent great advances in video generation models have demonstrated their potential to produce high-quality videos, bringing challenges to effective evaluation. Unlike human evaluation, existing automated evaluation metrics lack high-level semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities for video, thus making them infeasible and unexplainable. To fill this gap, we curate GRADEO-Instruct, a multi-dimensional T2V evaluation instruction tuning dataset, including 3.3k videos from over 10 existing video generation models and multi-step reasoning assessments converted by 16k human annotations. We then introduce GRADEO, one of the first specifically designed video evaluation models, which grades AI-generated videos for explainable scores and assessments through multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that our method aligns better with human evaluations than existing methods. Furthermore, our benchmarking reveals that current video generation models struggle to produce content that aligns with human reasoning and complex real-world scenarios. The models, datasets, and codes will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[TweedieMix: Improving Multi-Concept Fusion for Diffusion-based Image/Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05591v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in customizing text-to-image and video generation models, generating images and videos that effectively integrate multiple personalized concepts remains a challenging task. To address this, we present TweedieMix, a novel method for composing customized diffusion models during the inference phase. By analyzing the properties of reverse diffusion sampling, our approach divides the sampling process into two stages. During the initial steps, we apply a multiple object-aware sampling technique to ensure the inclusion of the desired target objects. In the later steps, we blend the appearances of the custom concepts in the de-noised image space using Tweedie's formula. Our results demonstrate that TweedieMix can generate multiple personalized concepts with higher fidelity than existing methods. Moreover, our framework can be effortlessly extended to image-to-video diffusion models, enabling the generation of videos that feature multiple personalized concepts. Results and source code are in our anonymous project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Page: https://github.com/KwonGihyun/TweedieMix</p></details> |
| **[MagicDriveDiT: High-Resolution Long Video Generation for Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13807v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion models has greatly improved video synthesis, especially in controllable video generation, which is vital for applications like autonomous driving. Although DiT with 3D VAE has become a standard framework for video generation, it introduces challenges in controllable driving video generation, especially for geometry control, rendering existing control methods ineffective. To address these issues, we propose MagicDriveDiT, a novel approach that integrates the MVDiT block and spatial-temporal conditional encoding to enable multi-view video generation and precise geometric control. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method for obtaining contextual descriptions for videos to support diverse textual control, along with a progressive training strategy using mixed video data to enhance training efficiency and generalizability. Consequently, MagicDriveDiT enables multi-view driving video synthesis with $3.3\times$ resolution and $4\times$ frame count (compared to current SOTA), rich contextual control, and geometric controls. Extensive experiments demonstrate MagicDriveDiT's ability, unlocking broader applications in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://flymin.github.io/magicdrivedit/</p></details> |
| **[VideoUFO: A Million-Scale User-Focused Dataset for Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01739v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generative models convert textual prompts into dynamic visual content, offering wide-ranging applications in film production, gaming, and education. However, their real-world performance often falls short of user expectations. One key reason is that these models have not been trained on videos related to some topics users want to create. In this paper, we propose VideoUFO, the first Video dataset specifically curated to align with Users' FOcus in real-world scenarios. Beyond this, our VideoUFO also features: (1) minimal ($0.29\%$) overlap with existing video datasets, and (2) videos searched exclusively via YouTube's official API under the Creative Commons license. These two attributes provide future researchers with greater freedom to broaden their training sources. The VideoUFO comprises over $1.09$ million video clips, each paired with both a brief and a detailed caption (description). Specifically, through clustering, we first identify $1,291$ user-focused topics from the million-scale real text-to-video prompt dataset, VidProM. Then, we use these topics to retrieve videos from YouTube, split the retrieved videos into clips, and generate both brief and detailed captions for each clip. After verifying the clips with specified topics, we are left with about $1.09$ million video clips. Our experiments reveal that (1) current $16$ text-to-video models do not achieve consistent performance across all user-focused topics; and (2) a simple model trained on VideoUFO outperforms others on worst-performing topics. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/WenhaoWang/VideoUFO under the CC BY 4.0 License.</p></details> |  |
| **[TransVDM: Motion-Constrained Video Diffusion Model for Transparent Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19454v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability to generate high-quality video content. Nonetheless, the potential of VDMs for creating transparent videos remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we introduce TransVDM, the first diffusion-based model specifically designed for transparent video generation. TransVDM integrates a Transparent Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) and a pretrained UNet-based VDM, along with a novel Alpha Motion Constraint Module (AMCM). The TVAE captures the alpha channel transparency of video frames and encodes it into the latent space of the VDMs, facilitating a seamless transition to transparent video diffusion models. To improve the detection of transparent areas, the AMCM integrates motion constraints from the foreground within the VDM, helping to reduce undesirable artifacts. Moreover, we curate a dataset containing 250K transparent frames for training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Offline Model-Based RL via Jointly-Optimized World-Action Model Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00564v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant aspiration of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop a generalist agent with high capabilities from large and heterogeneous datasets. However, prior approaches that scale offline RL either rely heavily on expert trajectories or struggle to generalize to diverse unseen tasks. Inspired by the excellent generalization of world model in conditional video generation, we explore the potential of image observation-based world model for scaling offline RL and enhancing generalization on novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce JOWA: Jointly-Optimized World-Action model, an offline model-based RL agent pretrained on multiple Atari games with 6 billion tokens data to learn general-purpose representation and decision-making ability. Our method jointly optimizes a world-action model through a shared transformer backbone, which stabilize temporal difference learning with large models during pretraining. Moreover, we propose a provably efficient and parallelizable planning algorithm to compensate for the Q-value estimation error and thus search out better policies. Experimental results indicate that our largest agent, with 150 million parameters, achieves 78.9% human-level performance on pretrained games using only 10% subsampled offline data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art large-scale offline RL baselines by 31.6% on averange. Furthermore, JOWA scales favorably with model capacity and can sample-efficiently transfer to novel games using only 5k offline fine-tuning data (approximately 4 trajectories) per game, demonstrating superior generalization. We will release codes and model weights at https://github.com/CJReinforce/JOWA</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[VideoHandles: Editing 3D Object Compositions in Videos Using Video Generative Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01107v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative methods for image and video editing use generative models as priors to perform edits despite incomplete information, such as changing the composition of 3D objects shown in a single image. Recent methods have shown promising composition editing results in the image setting, but in the video setting, editing methods have focused on editing object's appearance and motion, or camera motion, and as a result, methods to edit object composition in videos are still missing. We propose \name as a method for editing 3D object compositions in videos of static scenes with camera motion. Our approach allows editing the 3D position of a 3D object across all frames of a video in a temporally consistent manner. This is achieved by lifting intermediate features of a generative model to a 3D reconstruction that is shared between all frames, editing the reconstruction, and projecting the features on the edited reconstruction back to each frame. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative approach to edit object compositions in videos. Our approach is simple and training-free, while outperforming state-of-the-art image editing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://videohandles.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Extrapolating and Decoupling Image-to-Video Generation Models: Motion Modeling is Easier Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00948v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-to-Video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize a video clip according to a given image and condition (e.g., text). The key challenge of this task lies in simultaneously generating natural motions while preserving the original appearance of the images. However, current I2V diffusion models (I2V-DMs) often produce videos with limited motion degrees or exhibit uncontrollable motion that conflicts with the textual condition. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Extrapolating and Decoupling framework, which introduces model merging techniques to the I2V domain for the first time. Specifically, our framework consists of three separate stages: (1) Starting with a base I2V-DM, we explicitly inject the textual condition into the temporal module using a lightweight, learnable adapter and fine-tune the integrated model to improve motion controllability. (2) We introduce a training-free extrapolation strategy to amplify the dynamic range of the motion, effectively reversing the fine-tuning process to enhance the motion degree significantly. (3) With the above two-stage models excelling in motion controllability and degree, we decouple the relevant parameters associated with each type of motion ability and inject them into the base I2V-DM. Since the I2V-DM handles different levels of motion controllability and dynamics at various denoising time steps, we adjust the motion-aware parameters accordingly over time. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Q-Bench-Video: Benchmarking the Video Quality Understanding of LMMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20063v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rising interest in research on Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) for video understanding, many studies have emphasized general video comprehension capabilities, neglecting the systematic exploration into video quality understanding. To address this oversight, we introduce Q-Bench-Video in this paper, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LMMs' proficiency in discerning video quality. a) To ensure video source diversity, Q-Bench-Video encompasses videos from natural scenes, AI-generated Content (AIGC), and Computer Graphics (CG). b) Building on the traditional multiple-choice questions format with the Yes-or-No and What-How categories, we include Open-ended questions to better evaluate complex scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate the video pair quality comparison question to enhance comprehensiveness. c) Beyond the traditional Technical, Aesthetic, and Temporal distortions, we have expanded our evaluation aspects to include the dimension of AIGC distortions, which addresses the increasing demand for video generation. Finally, we collect a total of 2,378 question-answer pairs and test them on 12 open-source & 5 proprietary LMMs. Our findings indicate that while LMMs have a foundational understanding of video quality, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise, with a notable discrepancy compared to human performance. Through Q-Bench-Video, we seek to catalyze community interest, stimulate further research, and unlock the untapped potential of LMMs to close the gap in video quality understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Video Generation without Vector Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14169v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach that enables autoregressive video generation with high efficiency. We propose to reformulate the video generation problem as a non-quantized autoregressive modeling of temporal frame-by-frame prediction and spatial set-by-set prediction. Unlike raster-scan prediction in prior autoregressive models or joint distribution modeling of fixed-length tokens in diffusion models, our approach maintains the causal property of GPT-style models for flexible in-context capabilities, while leveraging bidirectional modeling within individual frames for efficiency. With the proposed approach, we train a novel video autoregressive model without vector quantization, termed NOVA. Our results demonstrate that NOVA surpasses prior autoregressive video models in data efficiency, inference speed, visual fidelity, and video fluency, even with a much smaller model capacity, i.e., 0.6B parameters. NOVA also outperforms state-of-the-art image diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks, with a significantly lower training cost. Additionally, NOVA generalizes well across extended video durations and enables diverse zero-shot applications in one unified model. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/baaivision/NOVA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[ViBiDSampler: Enhancing Video Interpolation Using Bidirectional Diffusion Sampler](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05651v3)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large-scale text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation, especially in terms of keyframe interpolation. However, current image-to-video diffusion models, while powerful in generating videos from a single conditioning frame, need adaptation for two-frame (start & end) conditioned generation, which is essential for effective bounded interpolation. Unfortunately, existing approaches that fuse temporally forward and backward paths in parallel often suffer from off-manifold issues, leading to artifacts or requiring multiple iterative re-noising steps. In this work, we introduce a novel, bidirectional sampling strategy to address these off-manifold issues without requiring extensive re-noising or fine-tuning. Our method employs sequential sampling along both forward and backward paths, conditioned on the start and end frames, respectively, ensuring more coherent and on-manifold generation of intermediate frames. Additionally, we incorporate advanced guidance techniques, CFG++ and DDS, to further enhance the interpolation process. By integrating these, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently generating high-quality, smooth videos between keyframes. On a single 3090 GPU, our method can interpolate 25 frames at 1024 x 576 resolution in just 195 seconds, establishing it as a leading solution for keyframe interpolation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; Project page: https://vibidsampler.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Animate Images from A Few Videos to Portray Delicate Human Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00276v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress, video generative models still struggle to animate human actions from static images, particularly when handling uncommon actions whose training data are limited. In this paper, we investigate the task of learning to animate human actions from a small number of videos -- 16 or fewer -- which is highly valuable in real-world applications like video and movie production. Few-shot learning of generalizable motion patterns while ensuring smooth transitions from the initial reference image is exceedingly challenging. We propose FLASH (Few-shot Learning to Animate and Steer Humans), which improves motion generalization by aligning motion features and inter-frame correspondence relations between videos that share the same motion but have different appearances. This approach minimizes overfitting to visual appearances in the limited training data and enhances the generalization of learned motion patterns. Additionally, FLASH extends the decoder with additional layers to compensate lost details in the latent space, fostering smooth transitions from the initial reference image. Experiments demonstrate that FLASH effectively animates images with unseen human or scene appearances into specified actions while maintaining smooth transitions from the reference image.</p></details> |  |
| **[Raccoon: Multi-stage Diffusion Training with Coarse-to-Fine Curating Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21314v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generation has demonstrated promising progress with the advent of diffusion models, yet existing approaches are limited by dataset quality and computational resources. To address these limitations, this paper presents a comprehensive approach that advances both data curation and model design. We introduce CFC-VIDS-1M, a high-quality video dataset constructed through a systematic coarse-to-fine curation pipeline. The pipeline first evaluates video quality across multiple dimensions, followed by a fine-grained stage that leverages vision-language models to enhance text-video alignment and semantic richness. Building upon the curated dataset's emphasis on visual quality and temporal coherence, we develop RACCOON, a transformer-based architecture with decoupled spatial-temporal attention mechanisms. The model is trained through a progressive four-stage strategy designed to efficiently handle the complexities of video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our integrated approach of high-quality data curation and efficient training strategy generates visually appealing and temporally coherent videos while maintaining computational efficiency. We will release our dataset, code, and models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free and Adaptive Sparse Attention for Efficient Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21079v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-fidelity long videos with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is often hindered by significant latency, primarily due to the computational demands of attention mechanisms. For instance, generating an 8-second 720p video (110K tokens) with HunyuanVideo takes about 600 PFLOPs, with around 500 PFLOPs consumed by attention computations. To address this issue, we propose AdaSpa, the first Dynamic Pattern and Online Precise Search sparse attention method. Firstly, to realize the Dynamic Pattern, we introduce a blockified pattern to efficiently capture the hierarchical sparsity inherent in DiTs. This is based on our observation that sparse characteristics of DiTs exhibit hierarchical and blockified structures between and within different modalities. This blockified approach significantly reduces the complexity of attention computation while maintaining high fidelity in the generated videos. Secondly, to enable Online Precise Search, we propose the Fused LSE-Cached Search with Head-adaptive Hierarchical Block Sparse Attention. This method is motivated by our finding that DiTs' sparse pattern and LSE vary w.r.t. inputs, layers, and heads, but remain invariant across denoising steps. By leveraging this invariance across denoising steps, it adapts to the dynamic nature of DiTs and allows for precise, real-time identification of sparse indices with minimal overhead. AdaSpa is implemented as an adaptive, plug-and-play solution and can be integrated seamlessly with existing DiTs, requiring neither additional fine-tuning nor a dataset-dependent profiling. Extensive experiments validate that AdaSpa delivers substantial acceleration across various models while preserving video quality, establishing itself as a robust and scalable approach to efficient video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[InterDyn: Controllable Interactive Dynamics with Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11785v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the dynamics of interacting objects is essential for both humans and intelligent systems. However, existing approaches are limited to simplified, toy settings and lack generalizability to complex, real-world environments. Recent advances in generative models have enabled the prediction of state transitions based on interventions, but focus on generating a single future state which neglects the continuous dynamics resulting from the interaction. To address this gap, we propose InterDyn, a novel framework that generates videos of interactive dynamics given an initial frame and a control signal encoding the motion of a driving object or actor. Our key insight is that large video generation models can act as both neural renderers and implicit physics simulators, having learned interactive dynamics from large-scale video data. To effectively harness this capability, we introduce an interactive control mechanism that conditions the video generation process on the motion of the driving entity. Qualitative results demonstrate that InterDyn generates plausible, temporally consistent videos of complex object interactions while generalizing to unseen objects. Quantitative evaluations show that InterDyn outperforms baselines that focus on static state transitions. This work highlights the potential of leveraging video generative models as implicit physics engines. Code and trained models will be released at: https://interdyn.is.tue.mpg.de/</p></details> |  |
| **[HAIC: Improving Human Action Understanding and Generation with Better Captions for Multi-modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20811v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made great progress in video understanding. However, their performance on videos involving human actions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to accumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second, videos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human attributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions and interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely HAICTrain and HAICBench. \textbf{HAICTrain} comprises 126K video-caption pairs generated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes. Meanwhile, \textbf{HAICBench} includes 500 manually annotated video-caption pairs and 1,400 QA pairs, for a comprehensive evaluation of human action understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that training with HAICTrain not only significantly enhances human understanding abilities across 4 benchmarks, but can also improve text-to-video generation results. Both the HAICTrain and HAICBench are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/KuaishouHAIC/HAIC.</p></details> |  |
| **[I2VControl-Camera: Precise Video Camera Control with Adjustable Motion Strength](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06525v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation technologies are developing rapidly and have broad potential applications. Among these technologies, camera control is crucial for generating professional-quality videos that accurately meet user expectations. However, existing camera control methods still suffer from several limitations, including control precision and the neglect of the control for subject motion dynamics. In this work, we propose I2VControl-Camera, a novel camera control method that significantly enhances controllability while providing adjustability over the strength of subject motion. To improve control precision, we employ point trajectory in the camera coordinate system instead of only extrinsic matrix information as our control signal. To accurately control and adjust the strength of subject motion, we explicitly model the higher-order components of the video trajectory expansion, not merely the linear terms, and design an operator that effectively represents the motion strength. We use an adapter architecture that is independent of the base model structure. Experiments on static and dynamic scenes show that our framework outperformances previous methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

| **[FlashVideo: Flowing Fidelity to Detail for Efficient High-Resolution Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05179v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DiT diffusion models have achieved great success in text-to-video generation, leveraging their scalability in model capacity and data scale. High content and motion fidelity aligned with text prompts, however, often require large model parameters and a substantial number of function evaluations (NFEs). Realistic and visually appealing details are typically reflected in high resolution outputs, further amplifying computational demands especially for single stage DiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two stage framework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs across stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage, prompt fidelity is prioritized through a low resolution generation process utilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational efficiency. The second stage establishes flow matching between low and high resolutions, effectively generating fine details with minimal NFEs. Quantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves state-of-the-art high resolution video generation with superior computational efficiency. Additionally, the two-stage design enables users to preview the initial output and accordingly adjust the prompt before committing to full-resolution generation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs and wait times as well as enhancing commercial viability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Model...</summary><p>Model and Weight: https://github.com/FoundationVision/FlashVideo</p></details> |

However, existing controlled diffusion transformer methods incur significant parameter and computational overheads and suffer from inefficient resource allocation due to their failure to account for the varying relevance of control information across different transformer layers. To address this, we propose the Relevance-Guided Efficient Controllable Generation framework, RelaCtrl, enabling efficient and resource-optimized integration of control signals into the Diffusion Transformer. First, we evaluate the relevance of each layer in the Diffusion Transformer to the control information by assessing the "ControlNet Relevance Score"-i.e., the impact of skipping each control layer on both the quality of generation and the control effectiveness during inference. Based on the strength of the relevance, we then tailor the positioning, parameter scale, and modeling capacity of the control layers to reduce unnecessary parameters and redundant computations. Additionally, to further improve efficiency, we replace the self-attention and FFN in the commonly used copy block with the carefully designed Two-Dimensional Shuffle Mixer (TDSM), enabling efficient implementation of both the token mixer and channel mixer. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance with only 15% of the parameters and computational complexity compared to PixArt-delta.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://360cvgroup.github.io/RelaCtrl/ Github: https://github.com/360CVGroup/RelaCtrl</p></details> |
| **[WorldModelBench: Judging Video Generation Models As World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20694v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have rapidly progressed, positioning themselves as video world models capable of supporting decision-making applications like robotics and autonomous driving. However, current benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate these claims, focusing only on general video quality, ignoring important factors to world models such as physics adherence. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldModelBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the world modeling capabilities of video generation models in application-driven domains. WorldModelBench offers two key advantages: (1) Against to nuanced world modeling violations: By incorporating instruction-following and physics-adherence dimensions, WorldModelBench detects subtle violations, such as irregular changes in object size that breach the mass conservation law - issues overlooked by prior benchmarks. (2) Aligned with large-scale human preferences: We crowd-source 67K human labels to accurately measure 14 frontier models. Using our high-quality human labels, we further fine-tune an accurate judger to automate the evaluation procedure, achieving 8.6% higher average accuracy in predicting world modeling violations than GPT-4o with 2B parameters. In addition, we demonstrate that training to align human annotations by maximizing the rewards from the judger noticeably improve the world modeling capability.

Unlike previous methods that rely on separately trained generative models for video generation and novel view synthesis, we design a unified diffusion model to generate novel view videos of dynamic 3D objects. Specifically, given a monocular reference video, SV4D generates novel views for each video frame that are temporally consistent. We then use the generated novel view videos to optimize an implicit 4D representation (dynamic NeRF) efficiently, without the need for cumbersome SDS-based optimization used in most prior works. To train our unified novel view video generation model, we curate a dynamic 3D object dataset from the existing Objaverse dataset. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets and user studies demonstrate SV4D's state-of-the-art performance on novel-view video synthesis as well as 4D generation compared to prior works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sv4d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Mobius: Text to Seamless Looping Video Generation via Latent Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20307v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Mobius, a novel method to generate seamlessly looping videos from text descriptions directly without any user annotations, thereby creating new visual materials for the multi-media presentation. Our method repurposes the pre-trained video latent diffusion model for generating looping videos from text prompts without any training. During inference, we first construct a latent cycle by connecting the starting and ending noise of the videos. Given that the temporal consistency can be maintained by the context of the video diffusion model, we perform multi-frame latent denoising by gradually shifting the first-frame latent to the end in each step. As a result, the denoising context varies in each step while maintaining consistency throughout the inference process. Moreover, the latent cycle in our method can be of any length. This extends our latent-shifting approach to generate seamless looping videos beyond the scope of the video diffusion model's context. Unlike previous cinemagraphs, the proposed method does not require an image as appearance, which will restrict the motions of the generated results. Instead, our method can produce more dynamic motion and better visual quality. We conduct multiple experiments and comparisons to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its efficacy in different scenarios. All the code will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mobius-diffusion.github.io/ ; GitHub repository: https://github.com/YisuiTT/Mobius</p></details> |
| **[Do generative video models understand physical principles?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09038v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI video generation is undergoing a revolution, with quality and realism advancing rapidly. These advances have led to a passionate scientific debate: Do video models learn "world models" that discover laws of physics -- or, alternatively, are they merely sophisticated pixel predictors that achieve visual realism without understanding the physical principles of reality? We address this question by developing Physics-IQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that can only be solved by acquiring a deep understanding of various physical principles, like fluid dynamics, optics, solid mechanics, magnetism and thermodynamics. We find that across a range of current models (Sora, Runway, Pika, Lumiere, Stable Video Diffusion, and VideoPoet), physical understanding is severely limited, and unrelated to visual realism. At the same time, some test cases can already be successfully solved. This indicates that acquiring certain physical principles from observation alone may be possible, but significant challenges remain. While we expect rapid advances ahead, our work demonstrates that visual realism does not imply physical understanding.

| **[FlexiDiT: Your Diffusion Transformer Can Easily Generate High-Quality Samples with Less Compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20126v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their remarkable performance, modern Diffusion Transformers are hindered by substantial resource requirements during inference, stemming from the fixed and large amount of compute needed for each denoising step. In this work, we revisit the conventional static paradigm that allocates a fixed compute budget per denoising iteration and propose a dynamic strategy instead. Our simple and sample-efficient framework enables pre-trained DiT models to be converted into \emph{flexible} ones -- dubbed FlexiDiT -- allowing them to process inputs at varying compute budgets. We demonstrate how a single \emph{flexible} model can generate images without any drop in quality, while reducing the required FLOPs by more than $40$\% compared to their static counterparts, for both class-conditioned and text-conditioned image generation. Our method is general and agnostic to input and conditioning modalities. We show how our approach can be readily extended for video generation, where FlexiDiT models generate samples with up to $75$\% less compute without compromising performance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a training-free approach to enhance the coherence and quality of DiT-based generated videos, named Enhance-A-Video. The core idea is enhancing the cross-frame correlations based on non-diagonal temporal attention distributions. Thanks to its simple design, our approach can be easily applied to most DiT-based video generation frameworks without any retraining or fine-tuning. Across various DiT-based video generation models, our approach demonstrates promising improvements in both temporal consistency and visual quality. We hope this research can inspire future explorations in video generation enhancement.</p></details> |  |
| **[C-Drag: Chain-of-Thought Driven Motion Controller for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19868v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory-based motion control has emerged as an intuitive and efficient approach for controllable video generation. However, the existing trajectory-based approaches are usually limited to only generating the motion trajectory of the controlled object and ignoring the dynamic interactions between the controlled object and its surroundings. To address this limitation, we propose a Chain-of-Thought-based motion controller for controllable video generation, named C-Drag. Instead of directly generating the motion of some objects, our C-Drag first performs object perception and then reasons the dynamic interactions between different objects according to the given motion control of the objects. Specifically, our method includes an object perception module and a Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module. The object perception module employs visual language models to capture the position and category information of various objects within the image. The Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module takes this information as input and conducts a stage-wise reasoning process to generate motion trajectories for each of the affected objects, which are subsequently fed to the diffusion model for video synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a new video object interaction (VOI) dataset to evaluate the generation quality of motion controlled video generation methods. Our VOI dataset contains three typical types of interactions and provides the motion trajectories of objects that can be used for accurate performance evaluation. Experimental results show that C-Drag achieves promising performance across multiple metrics, excelling in object motion control. Our benchmark, codes, and models will be available at https://github.com/WesLee88524/C-Drag-Official-Repo.</p></details> |  |

Despite their substantial potential, the generated videos may present artifacts, including structural implausibility, temporal inconsistency, and a lack of motion, often resulting in near-static video. In this work, we have identified a correlation between the disparity of temporal attention maps across different blocks and the occurrence of temporal inconsistencies. Additionally, we have observed that the energy contained within the temporal attention maps is directly related to the magnitude of motion amplitude in the generated videos. Based on these observations, we present ByTheWay, a training-free method to improve the quality of text-to-video generation without introducing additional parameters, augmenting memory or sampling time. Specifically, ByTheWay is composed of two principal components: 1) Temporal Self-Guidance improves the structural plausibility and temporal consistency of generated videos by reducing the disparity between the temporal attention maps across various decoder blocks. 2) Fourier-based Motion Enhancement enhances the magnitude and richness of motion by amplifying the energy of the map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ByTheWay significantly improves the quality of text-to-video generation with negligible additional cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Video Generation with Pyramid Attention Broadcast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12588v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Pyramid Attention Broadcast (PAB), a real-time, high quality and training-free approach for DiT-based video generation. Our method is founded on the observation that attention difference in the diffusion process exhibits a U-shaped pattern, indicating significant redundancy. We mitigate this by broadcasting attention outputs to subsequent steps in a pyramid style. It applies different broadcast strategies to each attention based on their variance for best efficiency. We further introduce broadcast sequence parallel for more efficient distributed inference. PAB demonstrates up to 10.5x speedup across three models compared to baselines, achieving real-time generation for up to 720p videos. We anticipate that our simple yet effective method will serve as a robust baseline and facilitate future research and application for video generation.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[EchoVideo: Identity-Preserving Human Video Generation by Multimodal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13452v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have significantly impacted various downstream applications, particularly in identity-preserving video generation (IPT2V). However, existing methods struggle with "copy-paste" artifacts and low similarity issues, primarily due to their reliance on low-level facial image information. This dependence can result in rigid facial appearances and artifacts reflecting irrelevant details. To address these challenges, we propose EchoVideo, which employs two key strategies: (1) an Identity Image-Text Fusion Module (IITF) that integrates high-level semantic features from text, capturing clean facial identity representations while discarding occlusions, poses, and lighting variations to avoid the introduction of artifacts; (2) a two-stage training strategy, incorporating a stochastic method in the second phase to randomly utilize shallow facial information. The objective is to balance the enhancements in fidelity provided by shallow features while mitigating excessive reliance on them. This strategy encourages the model to utilize high-level features during training, ultimately fostering a more robust representation of facial identities. EchoVideo effectively preserves facial identities and maintains full-body integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves excellent results in generating high-quality, controllability and fidelity videos.</p></details> |  |

However, 3D shape generation technology has so far lagged behind, constrained by limitations in 3D data scale, complexity of 3D data processing, and insufficient exploration of advanced techniques in the 3D domain. Current approaches to 3D shape generation face substantial challenges in terms of output quality, generalization capability, and alignment with input conditions. We present TripoSG, a new streamlined shape diffusion paradigm capable of generating high-fidelity 3D meshes with precise correspondence to input images. Specifically, we propose: 1) A large-scale rectified flow transformer for 3D shape generation, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity through training on extensive, high-quality data. 2) A hybrid supervised training strategy combining SDF, normal, and eikonal losses for 3D VAE, achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction performance. 3) A data processing pipeline to generate 2 million high-quality 3D samples, highlighting the crucial rules for data quality and quantity in training 3D generative models. Through comprehensive experiments, we have validated the effectiveness of each component in our new framework. The seamless integration of these parts has enabled TripoSG to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape generation. The resulting 3D shapes exhibit enhanced detail due to high-resolution capabilities and demonstrate exceptional fidelity to input images. Moreover, TripoSG demonstrates improved versatility in generating 3D models from diverse image styles and contents, showcasing strong generalization capabilities. To foster progress and innovation in the field of 3D generation, we will make our model publicly available.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the use of Large Vision Models (LVMs) for video continuation, a task essential for building world models and predicting future frames. We introduce ARCON, a scheme that alternates between generating semantic and RGB tokens, allowing the LVM to explicitly learn high-level structural video information.

Our models set a new state-of-the-art on multiple tasks: text-to-video synthesis, video personalization, video editing, video-to-audio generation, and text-to-audio generation. Our largest video generation model is a 30B parameter transformer trained with a maximum context length of 73K video tokens, corresponding to a generated video of 16 seconds at 16 frames-per-second. We show multiple technical innovations and simplifications on the architecture, latent spaces, training objectives and recipes, data curation, evaluation protocols, parallelization techniques, and inference optimizations that allow us to reap the benefits of scaling pre-training data, model size, and training compute for training large scale media generation models.

As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of O(N^2), compared to O(N) for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs almost no end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

However, existing methods suffer from poor controllability, making them less applicable to real-world scenarios such as filmmaking and live streaming for e-commerce. To address this limitation, we propose FLAP, a novel approach that integrates explicit 3D intermediate parameters (head poses and facial expressions) into the diffusion model for end-to-end generation of realistic portrait videos. The proposed architecture allows the model to generate vivid portrait videos from audio while simultaneously incorporating additional control signals, such as head rotation angles and eye-blinking frequency. Furthermore, the decoupling of head pose and facial expression allows for independent control of each, offering precise manipulation of both the avatar's pose and facial expressions. We also demonstrate its flexibility in integrating with existing 3D head generation methods, bridging the gap between 3D model-based approaches and end-to-end diffusion techniques. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms recent audio-driven portrait video models in both naturalness and controllability.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Glad: A Streaming Scene Generator for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00045v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation and simulation of diverse real-world scenes have significant application value in the field of autonomous driving, especially for the corner cases. Recently, researchers have explored employing neural radiance fields or diffusion models to generate novel views or synthetic data under driving scenes. However, these approaches suffer from unseen scenes or restricted video length, thus lacking sufficient adaptability for data generation and simulation. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective framework, named Glad, to generate video data in a frame-by-frame style. To ensure the temporal consistency of synthetic video, we introduce a latent variable propagation module, which views the latent features of previous frame as noise prior and injects it into the latent features of current frame. In addition, we design a streaming data sampler to orderly sample the original image in a video clip at continuous iterations. Given the reference frame, our Glad can be viewed as a streaming simulator by generating the videos for specific scenes. Extensive experiments are performed on the widely-used nuScenes dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Glad achieves promising performance, serving as a strong baseline for online video generation. We will release the source code and models publicly.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |

To accelerate this process, we developed a low-precision, mathematically-equivalent algorithm called PASA, based on Flash Attention. PASA introduces two novel techniques: online pseudo-average shifting and global recovering. These techniques enable the use of half-precision computation throughout the Flash Attention process without incurring overflow instability or unacceptable numerical accuracy loss. This algorithm enhances performance on memory-restricted AI hardware architectures, such as the Ascend Neural-network Processing Unit(NPU), by reducing data movement and increasing computational FLOPs. The algorithm is validated using both designed random benchmarks and real large models. We find that the large bias and amplitude of attention input data are critical factors contributing to numerical overflow ($>65504$ for half precision) in two different categories of large models (Qwen2-7B language models and Stable-Video-Diffusion multi-modal models). Specifically, overflow arises due to the large bias in the sequence dimension and the resonance mechanism between the query and key in the head dimension of the Stable-Video-Diffusion models. The resonance mechanism is defined as phase coincidence or 180-degree phase shift between query and key matrices. It will remarkably amplify the element values of attention score matrix. This issue also applies to the Qwen models. Additionally, numerical accuracy is assessed through root mean square error (RMSE) and by comparing the final generated texts and videos to those produced using high-precision attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 Pa...</summary><p>21 Pages, 14 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge.

Nevertheless, due to limitations in data and computational resources, achieving efficient generation of long videos with rich motion dynamics remains a significant challenge. To generate high-quality, dynamic, and temporally consistent long videos, this paper presents ARLON, a novel framework that boosts diffusion Transformers with autoregressive models for long video generation, by integrating the coarse spatial and long-range temporal information provided by the AR model to guide the DiT model. Specifically, ARLON incorporates several key innovations: 1) A latent Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) compresses the input latent space of the DiT model into compact visual tokens, bridging the AR and DiT models and balancing the learning complexity and information density; 2) An adaptive norm-based semantic injection module integrates the coarse discrete visual units from the AR model into the DiT model, ensuring effective guidance during video generation; 3) To enhance the tolerance capability of noise introduced from the AR inference, the DiT model is trained with coarser visual latent tokens incorporated with an uncertainty sampling module. Experimental results demonstrate that ARLON significantly outperforms the baseline OpenSora-V1.2 on eight out of eleven metrics selected from VBench, with notable improvements in dynamic degree and aesthetic quality, while delivering competitive results on the remaining three and simultaneously accelerating the generation process. In addition, ARLON achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation. Detailed analyses of the improvements in inference efficiency are presented, alongside a practical application that demonstrates the generation of long videos using progressive text prompts.

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

However, like other AIGC types, video generation requires robust content control. A common approach is to embed watermarks, but most research has focused on images, with limited attention given to videos. Traditional methods, which embed watermarks frame-by-frame in a post-processing manner, often degrade video quality. In this paper, we propose VideoShield, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for popular diffusion-based video generation models. Unlike post-processing methods, VideoShield embeds watermarks directly during video generation, eliminating the need for additional training. To ensure video integrity, we introduce a tamper localization feature that can detect changes both temporally (across frames) and spatially (within individual frames). Our method maps watermark bits to template bits, which are then used to generate watermarked noise during the denoising process. Using DDIM Inversion, we can reverse the video to its original watermarked noise, enabling straightforward watermark extraction. Additionally, template bits allow precise detection for potential temporal and spatial modification. Extensive experiments across various video models (both T2V and I2V models) demonstrate that our method effectively extracts watermarks and detects tamper without compromising video quality. Furthermore, we show that this approach is applicable to image generation models, enabling tamper detection in generated images as well.

To achieve this, we propose a novel method that guides single-modal models to cooperatively generate well-aligned samples across modalities. Specifically, given two pre-trained base diffusion models, we train a lightweight joint guidance module to adjust scores separately estimated by the base models to match the score of joint distribution over audio and video. We show that this guidance can be computed using the gradient of the optimal discriminator, which distinguishes real audio-video pairs from fake ones independently generated by the base models. Based on this analysis, we construct a joint guidance module by training this discriminator. Additionally, we adopt a loss function to stabilize the discriminator's gradient and make it work as a noise estimator, as in standard diffusion models. Empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method improves both single-modal fidelity and multimodal alignment with relatively few parameters.

Video generation presents unique challenges beyond static image generation, requiring both high-quality individual frames and temporal coherence to maintain consistency across the spatiotemporal sequence. Recent works have aimed at addressing the spatiotemporal consistency issue in video generation, while few literature review has been organized from this perspective. This gap hinders a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms for high-quality video generation. In this survey, we systematically review the recent advances in video generation, covering five key aspects: foundation models, information representations, generation schemes, post-processing techniques, and evaluation metrics. We particularly focus on their contributions to maintaining spatiotemporal consistency. Finally, we discuss the future directions and challenges in this field, hoping to inspire further efforts to advance the development of video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Camera Control for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10126v4)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a training-free and robust solution to offer camera movement control for off-the-shelf video diffusion models. Unlike previous work, our method does not require any supervised finetuning on camera-annotated datasets or self-supervised training via data augmentation. Instead, it can be plug-and-play with most pretrained video diffusion models and generate camera-controllable videos with a single image or text prompt as input. The inspiration for our work comes from the layout prior that intermediate latents encode for the generated results, thus rearranging noisy pixels in them will cause the output content to relocate as well. As camera moving could also be seen as a type of pixel rearrangement caused by perspective change, videos can be reorganized following specific camera motion if their noisy latents change accordingly. Building on this, we propose CamTrol, which enables robust camera control for video diffusion models. It is achieved by a two-stage process. First, we model image layout rearrangement through explicit camera movement in 3D point cloud space. Second, we generate videos with camera motion by leveraging the layout prior of noisy latents formed by a series of rearranged images. Extensive experiments have demonstrated its superior performance in both video generation and camera motion alignment compared with other finetuned methods. Furthermore, we show the capability of CamTrol to generalize to various base models, as well as its impressive applications in scalable motion control, dealing with complicated trajectories and unsupervised 3D video generation.

As its core, we introduce a unified transformer-diffusion framework, featuring an autoregressive transformer model that synthesize extended and music-synchronized token sequences for 2D body, head and hands poses, which then guide a diffusion model to produce coherent and realistic dance video frames. Unlike traditional methods that primarily generate human motion in 3D, X-Dancer addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by modeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, capturing their nuanced alignment with musical beats through readily available monocular videos. To achieve this, we first build a spatially compositional token representation from 2D human pose labels associated with keypoint confidences, encoding both large articulated body movements (e.g., upper and lower body) and fine-grained motions (e.g., head and hands). We then design a music-to-motion transformer model that autoregressively generates music-aligned dance pose token sequences, incorporating global attention to both musical style and prior motion context. Finally we leverage a diffusion backbone to animate the reference image with these synthesized pose tokens through AdaIN, forming a fully differentiable end-to-end framework. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Dancer is able to produce both diverse and characterized dance videos, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods in term of diversity, expressiveness and realism.

However, multi-grained video editing, which encompasses class-level, instance-level, and part-level modifications, remains a formidable challenge. The major difficulties in multi-grained editing include semantic misalignment of text-to-region control and feature coupling within the diffusion model. To address these difficulties, we present VideoGrain, a zero-shot approach that modulates space-time (cross- and self-) attention mechanisms to achieve fine-grained control over video content. We enhance text-to-region control by amplifying each local prompt's attention to its corresponding spatial-disentangled region while minimizing interactions with irrelevant areas in cross-attention. Additionally, we improve feature separation by increasing intra-region awareness and reducing inter-region interference in self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world scenarios.

Diffusion models have emerged as superior alternatives to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) by addressing their limitations, such as training instability, mode collapse, and poor representation of multimodal distributions. This success has spurred widespread research interest. In the domain of tabular data, diffusion models have begun to showcase similar advantages over GANs and VAEs, achieving significant performance breakthroughs and demonstrating their potential for addressing unique challenges in tabular data modeling. However, while domains like images and time series have numerous surveys summarizing advancements in diffusion models, there remains a notable gap in the literature for tabular data. Despite the increasing interest in diffusion models for tabular data, there has been little effort to systematically review and summarize these developments. This lack of a dedicated survey limits a clear understanding of the challenges, progress, and future directions in this critical area. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of diffusion models for tabular data. Covering works from June 2015, when diffusion models emerged, to December 2024, we analyze nearly all relevant studies, with updates maintained in a \href{https://github.com/Diffusion-Model-Leiden/awesome-diffusion-models-for-tabular-data}{GitHub repository}. Assuming readers possess foundational knowledge of statistics and diffusion models, we employ mathematical formulations to deliver a rigorous and detailed review, aiming to promote developments in this emerging and exciting area.</p></details> |  |

A deep compression Variational Autoencoder, Video-VAE, is designed for video generation tasks, achieving 16x16 spatial and 8x temporal compression ratios, while maintaining exceptional video reconstruction quality. User prompts are encoded using two bilingual text encoders to handle both English and Chinese. A DiT with 3D full attention is trained using Flow Matching and is employed to denoise input noise into latent frames.

However, it conversely exacerbates the risk of image misuse, as attackers may use one available image to create videos involving politics, violence, and other illegal content. To counter this threat, we propose Dormant, a novel protection approach tailored to defend against pose-driven human image animation techniques. Dormant applies protective perturbation to one human image, preserving the visual similarity to the original but resulting in poor-quality video generation. The protective perturbation is optimized to induce misextraction of appearance features from the image and create incoherence among the generated video frames. Our extensive evaluation across 8 animation methods and 4 datasets demonstrates the superiority of Dormant over 6 baseline protection methods, leading to misaligned identities, visual distortions, noticeable artifacts, and inconsistent frames in the generated videos. Moreover, Dormant shows effectiveness on 6 real-world commercial services, even with fully black-box access.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security 2025</p></details> |

However, larger model sizes and multi-frame processing for video generation lead to increased computational and memory costs, posing challenges for practical deployment on edge devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective method for reducing memory costs and computational complexity. When quantizing diffusion transformers, we find that existing quantization methods face challenges when applied to text-to-image and video tasks. To address these challenges, we begin by systematically analyzing the source of quantization error and conclude with the unique challenges posed by DiT quantization. Accordingly, we design an improved quantization scheme: ViDiT-Q (Video & Image Diffusion Transformer Quantization), tailored specifically for DiT models. We validate the effectiveness of ViDiT-Q across a variety of text-to-image and video models, achieving W8A8 and W4A8 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics. Additionally, we implement efficient GPU kernels to achieve practical 2-2.5x memory saving and a 1.4-1.7x end-to-end latency speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025, Project Page: https://a-suozhang.xyz/viditq.github.io/</p></details> |

However, generating even longer videos with temporal coherence remains a major challenge, and existing length extrapolation methods lead to temporal repetition or motion deceleration. In this work, we systematically analyze the role of frequency components in positional embeddings and identify an intrinsic frequency that primarily governs extrapolation behavior. Based on this insight, we propose RIFLEx, a minimal yet effective approach that reduces the intrinsic frequency to suppress repetition while preserving motion consistency, without requiring any additional modifications. RIFLEx offers a true free lunch--achieving high-quality $2\times$ extrapolation on state-of-the-art video diffusion transformers in a completely training-free manner. Moreover, it enhances quality and enables $3\times$ extrapolation by minimal fine-tuning without long videos.

VaViM is a simple auto-regressive video model that predicts frames using spatio-temporal token sequences. We show that it captures the semantics and dynamics of driving scenes. VaVAM, the video-action model, leverages the learned representations of VaViM to generate driving trajectories through imitation learning. Together, the models form a complete perception-to-action pipeline. We evaluate our models in open- and closed-loop driving scenarios, revealing that video-based pre-training holds promise for autonomous driving. Key insights include the semantic richness of the learned representations, the benefits of scaling for video synthesis, and the complex relationship between model size, data, and safety metrics in closed-loop evaluations.

However, while latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), combines the advantages of graph neural networks, i.e., the traceability of entities across time-steps, with the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder are frozen to enable generative modeling in the latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is to introduce identifier representations (IDs) to allow for retrieval of entity properties, e.g., entity coordinates, from latent system representations and thus enables traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

| **[Hardware-Friendly Static Quantization Method for Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15077v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers for video generation have gained significant research interest since the impressive performance of SORA. Efficient deployment of such generative-AI models on GPUs has been demonstrated with dynamic quantization. However, resource-constrained devices cannot support dynamic quantization, and need static quantization of the models for their efficient deployment on AI processors. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the post-training quantization of OpenSora\cite{opensora}, a Video Diffusion Transformer, without relying on dynamic quantization techniques. Our approach employs static quantization, achieving video quality comparable to FP16 and dynamically quantized ViDiT-Q methods, as measured by CLIP, and VQA metrics. In particular, we utilize per-step calibration data to adequately provide a post-training statically quantized model for each time step, incorporating channel-wise quantization for weights and tensor-wise quantization for activations. By further applying the smooth-quantization technique, we can obtain high-quality video outputs with the statically quantized models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that static quantization can be a viable alternative to dynamic quantization for video diffusion transformers, offering a more efficient approach without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAVID: An Agentic LVLM Framework for Diffusion-Generated Video Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14994v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impressive achievements of generative models in creating high-quality videos have raised concerns about digital integrity and privacy vulnerabilities. Recent works of AI-generated content detection have been widely studied in the image field (e.g., deepfake), yet the video field has been unexplored. Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) has become an emerging tool for AI-generated content detection for its strong reasoning and multimodal capabilities. It breaks the limitations of traditional deep learning based methods faced with like lack of transparency and inability to recognize new artifacts. Motivated by this, we propose LAVID, a novel LVLMs-based ai-generated video detection with explicit knowledge enhancement. Our insight list as follows: (1) The leading LVLMs can call external tools to extract useful information to facilitate its own video detection task; (2) Structuring the prompt can affect LVLM's reasoning ability to interpret information in video content. Our proposed pipeline automatically selects a set of explicit knowledge tools for detection, and then adaptively adjusts the structure prompt by self-rewriting. Different from prior SOTA that trains additional detectors, our method is fully training-free and only requires inference of the LVLM for detection. To facilitate our research, we also create a new benchmark \vidfor with high-quality videos generated from multiple sources of video generation tools. Evaluation results show that LAVID improves F1 scores by 6.2 to 30.2% over the top baselines on our datasets across four SOTA LVLMs.</p></details> |  |

Effective traversal of the latent space learned by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has been the basis for recent breakthroughs in image editing. However, the applicability of such advancements to the video domain has been hindered by the difficulty of representing and controlling videos in the latent space of GANs. In particular, videos are composed of content (i.e., appearance) and complex motion components that require a special mechanism to disentangle and control. To achieve this, VidStyleODE encodes the video content in a pre-trained StyleGAN $\mathcal{W}_+$ space and benefits from a latent ODE component to summarize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the input video. Our novel continuous video generation process then combines the two to generate high-quality and temporally consistent videos with varying frame rates. We show that our proposed method enables a variety of applications on real videos: text-guided appearance manipulation, motion manipulation, image animation, and video interpolation and extrapolation.

While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K 256x256 and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 17x256x256.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 22 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Second, the lack of large-scale public available MIRST dataset in satellite videos greatly hinders the algorithm development. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we first build a large-scale dataset for MIRST detection in satellite videos (namely IRSatVideo-LEO), and then develop a recurrent feature refinement (RFR) framework as the baseline method. Specifically, IRSatVideo-LEO is a semi-simulated dataset with synthesized satellite motion, target appearance, trajectory and intensity, which can provide a standard toolbox for satellite video generation and a reliable evaluation platform to facilitate the algorithm development. For baseline method, RFR is proposed to be equipped with existing powerful CNN-based methods for long-term temporal dependency exploitation and integrated motion compensation & MIRST detection. Specifically, a pyramid deformable alignment (PDA) module and a temporal-spatial-frequency modulation (TSFM) module are proposed to achieve effective and efficient feature alignment, propagation, aggregation and refinement. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our scheme. The comparative results show that ResUNet equipped with RFR outperforms the state-of-the-art MIRST detection methods.

Though these models are necessary in many low-latency applications like Augmented/Virtual Reality, they cannot be deployed on resource-constrained Edge devices (like Apple Vision Pro or Meta Ray-Ban glasses) due to their huge computational complexity. To overcome this, we turn to knowledge distillation and perform a thorough design-space exploration to achieve the best DiT for a given parameter size. In particular, we provide principles for how to choose design knobs such as depth, width, attention heads and distillation setup for a DiT. During the process, a three-way trade-off emerges between model performance, size and speed that is crucial for Edge implementation of diffusion. We also propose two distillation approaches - Teaching Assistant (TA) method and Multi-In-One (MI1) method - to perform feature distillation in the DiT context. Unlike existing solutions, we demonstrate and benchmark the efficacy of our approaches on practical Edge devices such as NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.</p></details> | 4 pages |

In this paper, we introduce CustomVideoX, an innovative framework leveraging the video diffusion transformer for personalized video generation from a reference image. CustomVideoX capitalizes on pre-trained video networks by exclusively training the LoRA parameters to extract reference features, ensuring both efficiency and adaptability. To facilitate seamless interaction between the reference image and video content, we propose 3D Reference Attention, which enables direct and simultaneous engagement of reference image features with all video frames across spatial and temporal dimensions. To mitigate the excessive influence of reference image features and textual guidance on generated video content during inference, we implement the Time-Aware Reference Attention Bias (TAB) strategy, dynamically modulating reference bias over different time steps. Additionally, we introduce the Entity Region-Aware Enhancement (ERAE) module, aligning highly activated regions of key entity tokens with reference feature injection by adjusting attention bias. To thoroughly evaluate personalized video generation, we establish a new benchmark, VideoBench, comprising over 50 objects and 100 prompts for extensive assessment. Experimental results show that CustomVideoX significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of video consistency and quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secti...</summary><p>Section 4 in CustomVideoX Entity Region-Aware Enhancement has description errors.

In this paper, we propose a novel conditional diffusion model with spatial attention and latent embedding (cDAL) for medical image segmentation. In cDAL, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based discriminator is used at every time-step of the diffusion process to distinguish between the generated labels and the real ones. A spatial attention map is computed based on the features learned by the discriminator to help cDAL generate more accurate segmentation of discriminative regions in an input image. Additionally, we incorporated a random latent embedding into each layer of our model to significantly reduce the number of training and sampling time-steps, thereby making it much faster than other diffusion models for image segmentation. We applied cDAL on 3 publicly available medical image segmentation datasets (MoNuSeg, Chest X-ray and Hippocampus) and observed significant qualitative and quantitative improvements with higher Dice scores and mIoU over the state-of-the-art algorithms.

To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training.

Beyond the training and sampling phases, recent studies have investigated noise priors of diffusion models, as improved noise priors yield better generation results. One recent approach employs the Fourier transform to manipulate noise, marking the initial exploration of frequency operations in this context. However, it often generates videos that lack motion dynamics and imaging details. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the variance decay issue present in existing methods, contributing to the loss of details and motion dynamics. Recognizing the critical impact of noise distribution on generation quality, we introduce FreqPrior, a novel noise initialization strategy that refines noise in the frequency domain. Our method features a novel filtering technique designed to address different frequency signals while maintaining the noise prior distribution that closely approximates a standard Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we propose a partial sampling process by perturbing the latent at an intermediate timestep during finding the noise prior, significantly reducing inference time without compromising quality. Extensive experiments on VBench demonstrate that our method achieves the highest scores in both quality and semantic assessments, resulting in the best overall total score. These results highlight the superiority of our proposed noise prior.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, significant challenges remain to achieve satisfied facial dynamics while keeping the identity unchanged. In this work, we present a novel tuning-free IPT2V framework by enhancing face knowledge of the pre-trained video model built on diffusion transformers (DiT), dubbed FantasyID. Essentially, 3D facial geometry prior is incorporated to ensure plausible facial structures during video synthesis. To prevent the model from learning copy-paste shortcuts that simply replicate reference face across frames, a multi-view face augmentation strategy is devised to capture diverse 2D facial appearance features, hence increasing the dynamics over the facial expressions and head poses. Additionally, after blending the 2D and 3D features as guidance, instead of naively employing cross-attention to inject guidance cues into DiT layers, a learnable layer-aware adaptive mechanism is employed to selectively inject the fused features into each individual DiT layers, facilitating balanced modeling of identity preservation and motion dynamics. Experimental results validate our model's superiority over the current tuning-free IPT2V methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Animate Your Thoughts: Decoupled Reconstruction of Dynamic Natural Vision from Slow Brain Activity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03280v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing human dynamic vision from brain activity is a challenging task with great scientific significance. Although prior video reconstruction methods have made substantial progress, they still suffer from several limitations, including: (1) difficulty in simultaneously reconciling semantic (e.g. categorical descriptions), structure (e.g. size and color), and consistent motion information (e.g. order of frames); (2) low temporal resolution of fMRI, which poses a challenge in decoding multiple frames of video dynamics from a single fMRI frame; (3) reliance on video generation models, which introduces ambiguity regarding whether the dynamics observed in the reconstructed videos are genuinely derived from fMRI data or are hallucinations from generative model. To overcome these limitations, we propose a two-stage model named Mind-Animator. During the fMRI-to-feature stage, we decouple semantic, structure, and motion features from fMRI. Specifically, we employ fMRI-vision-language tri-modal contrastive learning to decode semantic feature from fMRI and design a sparse causal attention mechanism for decoding multi-frame video motion features through a next-frame-prediction task. In the feature-to-video stage, these features are integrated into videos using an inflated Stable Diffusion, effectively eliminating external video data interference. Extensive experiments on multiple video-fMRI datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive visualization analyses further elucidate the interpretability of our model from a neurobiological perspective. Project page: https://mind-animator-design.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

The rise of high-quality AI-generated content has spurred interest in AI-driven micro-video creation. However, despite the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and DeepSeek in text generation and reasoning, their potential to assist the creation of popular micro-videos remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn). Specifically, we investigate the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation? (ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity? (iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task? By exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 enable micro-video generation to achieve popularity comparable to human-created content. Prompt enhancements further boost popularity, and benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 among LLMs, while LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo lead in video generation. This pioneering work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation, uncovering new research opportunities. We will release the code and datasets to support future studies.</p></details> |  |

This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of T2V-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-to-video outputs remain challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed T2VEval-Bench, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset for text-to-video quality evaluation, which contains 148 textual prompts and 1,783 videos generated by 13 T2V models. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we scored each video on four dimensions in the subjective experiment, which are overall impression, text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Based on T2VEval-Bench, we developed T2VEval, a multi-branch fusion scheme for T2V quality evaluation. T2VEval assesses videos across three branches: text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large language model. Additionally, we implemented a divide-and-conquer training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces VidCapBench, a video caption evaluation scheme specifically designed for T2V generation, agnostic to any particular caption format. VidCapBench employs a data annotation pipeline, combining expert model labeling and human refinement, to associate each collected video with key information spanning video aesthetics, content, motion, and physical laws. VidCapBench then partitions these key information attributes into automatically assessable and manually assessable subsets, catering to both the rapid evaluation needs of agile development and the accuracy requirements of thorough validation. By evaluating numerous state-of-the-art captioning models, we demonstrate the superior stability and comprehensiveness of VidCapBench compared to existing video captioning evaluation approaches. Verification with off-the-shelf T2V models reveals a significant positive correlation between scores on VidCapBench and the T2V quality evaluation metrics, indicating that VidCapBench can provide valuable guidance for training T2V models.

| **[A Physical Coherence Benchmark for Evaluating Video Generation Models via Optical Flow-guided Frame Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05503v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation models demonstrate their potential as world simulators, but they often struggle with videos deviating from physical laws, a key concern overlooked by most text-to-video benchmarks. We introduce a benchmark designed specifically to assess the Physical Coherence of generated videos, PhyCoBench. Our benchmark includes 120 prompts covering 7 categories of physical principles, capturing key physical laws observable in video content. We evaluated four state-of-the-art (SoTA) T2V models on PhyCoBench and conducted manual assessments. Additionally, we propose an automated evaluation model: PhyCoPredictor, a diffusion model that generates optical flow and video frames in a cascade manner. Through a consistency evaluation comparing automated and manual sorting, the experimental results show that PhyCoPredictor currently aligns most closely with human evaluation. Therefore, it can effectively evaluate the physical coherence of videos, providing insights for future model optimization. Our benchmark, including physical coherence prompts, the automatic evaluation tool PhyCoPredictor, and the generated video dataset, has been released on GitHub at https://github.com/Jeckinchen/PhyCoBench.</p></details> |  |

| **[MALT Diffusion: Memory-Augmented Latent Transformers for Any-Length Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12632v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are successful for synthesizing high-quality videos but are limited to generating short clips (e.g., 2-10 seconds). Synthesizing sustained footage (e.g. over minutes) still remains an open research question. In this paper, we propose MALT Diffusion (using Memory-Augmented Latent Transformers), a new diffusion model specialized for long video generation. MALT Diffusion (or just MALT) handles long videos by subdividing them into short segments and doing segment-level autoregressive generation. To achieve this, we first propose recurrent attention layers that encode multiple segments into a compact memory latent vector; by maintaining this memory vector over time, MALT is able to condition on it and continuously generate new footage based on a long temporal context. We also present several training techniques that enable the model to generate frames over a long horizon with consistent quality and minimal degradation. We validate the effectiveness of MALT through experiments on long video benchmarks. We first perform extensive analysis of MALT in long-contextual understanding capability and stability using popular long video benchmarks. For example, MALT achieves an FVD score of 220.4 on 128-frame video generation on UCF-101, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of 648.4. Finally, we explore MALT's capabilities in a text-to-video generation setting and show that it can produce long videos compared with recent techniques for long text-to-video generation.</p></details> | preprint. 26 pages |
| **[Harness Local Rewards for Global Benefits: Effective Text-to-Video Generation Alignment with Patch-level Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06812v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of diffusion models (DMs) has significantly improved the quality of text-to-video generation models (VGMs). However, current VGM optimization primarily emphasizes the global quality of videos, overlooking localized errors, which leads to suboptimal generation capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a post-training strategy for VGMs, HALO, which explicitly incorporates local feedback from a patch reward model, providing detailed and comprehensive training signals with the video reward model for advanced VGM optimization. To develop an effective patch reward model, we distill GPT-4o to continuously train our video reward model, which enhances training efficiency and ensures consistency between video and patch reward distributions. Furthermore, to harmoniously integrate patch rewards into VGM optimization, we introduce a granular DPO (Gran-DPO) algorithm for DMs, allowing collaborative use of both patch and video rewards during the optimization process. Experimental results indicate that our patch reward model aligns well with human annotations and HALO substantially outperforms the baselines across two evaluation methods. Further experiments quantitatively prove the existence of patch defects, and our proposed method could effectively alleviate this issue.</p></details> |  |
| **[DLFR-VAE: Dynamic Latent Frame Rate VAE for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11897v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Latent Frame Rate VAE (DLFR-VAE), a training-free paradigm that can make use of adaptive temporal compression in latent space. While existing video generative models apply fixed compression rates via pretrained VAE, we observe that real-world video content exhibits substantial temporal non-uniformity, with high-motion segments containing more information than static scenes. Based on this insight, DLFR-VAE dynamically adjusts the latent frame rate according to the content complexity. Specifically, DLFR-VAE comprises two core innovations: (1) A Dynamic Latent Frame Rate Scheduler that partitions videos into temporal chunks and adaptively determines optimal frame rates based on information-theoretic content complexity, and (2) A training-free adaptation mechanism that transforms pretrained VAE architectures into a dynamic VAE that can process features with variable frame rates. Our simple but effective DLFR-VAE can function as a plug-and-play module, seamlessly integrating with existing video generation models and accelerating the video generation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-Centric Image to Video Generation with Language Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11655v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and flexible world models are crucial for autonomous systems to understand their environment and predict future events. Object-centric models, with structured latent spaces, have shown promise in modeling object dynamics and interactions, but often face challenges in scaling to complex datasets and incorporating external guidance, limiting their applicability in robotics. To address these limitations, we propose TextOCVP, an object-centric model for image-to-video generation guided by textual descriptions. TextOCVP parses an observed scene into object representations, called slots, and utilizes a text-conditioned transformer predictor to forecast future object states and video frames. Our approach jointly models object dynamics and interactions while incorporating textual guidance, thus leading to accurate and controllable predictions. Our method's structured latent space offers enhanced control over the prediction process, outperforming several image-to-video generative baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured object-centric representations provide superior controllability and interpretability, facilitating the modeling of object dynamics and enabling more precise and understandable predictions. Videos and code are available at https://play-slot.github.io/TextOCVP/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient-vDiT: Efficient Video Diffusion Transformers With Attention Tile](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06155v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the promise of synthesizing high-fidelity videos, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention suffer from expensive inference due to the complexity of attention computation and numerous sampling steps. For example, the popular Open-Sora-Plan model consumes more than 9 minutes for generating a single video of 29 frames. This paper addresses the inefficiency issue from two aspects: 1) Prune the 3D full attention based on the redundancy within video data; We identify a prevalent tile-style repetitive pattern in the 3D attention maps for video data, and advocate a new family of sparse 3D attention that holds a linear complexity w.r.t. the number of video frames. 2) Shorten the sampling process by adopting existing multi-step consistency distillation; We split the entire sampling trajectory into several segments and perform consistency distillation within each one to activate few-step generation capacities. We further devise a three-stage training pipeline to conjoin the low-complexity attention and few-step generation capacities. Notably, with 0.1% pretraining data, we turn the Open-Sora-Plan-1.2 model into an efficient one that is 7.4x -7.8x faster for 29 and 93 frames 720p video generation with a marginal performance trade-off in VBench. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach is amenable to distributed inference, achieving an additional 3.91x speedup when running on 4 GPUs with sequence parallelism.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods are limited to static images and lack the ability to control video animation generation using hand-drawn sketches. To address this gap, we propose VidSketch, the first method capable of generating high-quality video animations directly from any number of hand-drawn sketches and simple text prompts, bridging the divide between ordinary users and professional artists. Specifically, our method introduces a Level-Based Sketch Control Strategy to automatically adjust the guidance strength of sketches during the generation process, accommodating users with varying drawing skills. Furthermore, a TempSpatial Attention mechanism is designed to enhance the spatiotemporal consistency of generated video animations, significantly improving the coherence across frames.

We present a conditional encoder designed to adapt an image-to-video model for large-motion frame interpolation. To enhance performance, we integrate a dual-branch feature extractor and propose a cross-frame attention mechanism that effectively captures both spatial and temporal information, enabling accurate interpolations of intermediate frames. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on the Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) metric when evaluated against other state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in handling large motion scenarios, highlighting advancements in generative-based methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magic 1-For-1: Generating One Minute Video Clips within One Minute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07701v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this technical report, we present Magic 1-For-1 (Magic141), an efficient video generation model with optimized memory consumption and inference latency. The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average. We conduct a series of preliminary explorations to find out the optimal tradeoff between computational cost and video quality during diffusion step distillation and hope this could be a good foundation model for open-source explorations.

In this work, we introduce \textbf{MaskFlow}, a unified video generation framework that combines discrete representations with flow-matching to enable efficient generation of high-quality long videos. By leveraging a frame-level masking strategy during training, MaskFlow conditions on previously generated unmasked frames to generate videos with lengths ten times beyond that of the training sequences. MaskFlow does so very efficiently by enabling the use of fast Masked Generative Model (MGM)-style sampling and can be deployed in both fully autoregressive as well as full-sequence generation modes. We validate the quality of our method on the FaceForensics (FFS) and Deepmind Lab (DMLab) datasets and report Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. We also provide a detailed analysis on the sampling efficiency of our method and demonstrate that MaskFlow can be applied to both timestep-dependent and timestep-independent models in a training-free manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phantom: Subject-consistent video generation via cross-modal alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11079v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The continuous development of foundational models for video generation is evolving into various applications, with subject-consistent video generation still in the exploratory stage. We refer to this as Subject-to-Video, which extracts subject elements from reference images and generates subject-consistent video through textual instructions. We believe that the essence of subject-to-video lies in balancing the dual-modal prompts of text and image, thereby deeply and simultaneously aligning both text and visual content. To this end, we propose Phantom, a unified video generation framework for both single and multi-subject references. Building on existing text-to-video and image-to-video architectures, we redesign the joint text-image injection model and drive it to learn cross-modal alignment via text-image-video triplet data. In particular, we emphasize subject consistency in human generation, covering existing ID-preserving video generation while offering enhanced advantages.

| **[FLIP: Flow-Centric Generative Planning as General-Purpose Manipulation World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08261v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to develop a model-based planning framework for world models that can be scaled with increasing model and data budgets for general-purpose manipulation tasks with only language and vision inputs. To this end, we present FLow-centric generative Planning (FLIP), a model-based planning algorithm on visual space that features three key modules: 1. a multi-modal flow generation model as the general-purpose action proposal module; 2. a flow-conditioned video generation model as the dynamics module; and 3. a vision-language representation learning model as the value module. Given an initial image and language instruction as the goal, FLIP can progressively search for long-horizon flow and video plans that maximize the discounted return to accomplish the task. FLIP is able to synthesize long-horizon plans across objects, robots, and tasks with image flows as the general action representation, and the dense flow information also provides rich guidance for long-horizon video generation. In addition, the synthesized flow and video plans can guide the training of low-level control policies for robot execution. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FLIP can improve both the success rates and quality of long-horizon video plan synthesis and has the interactive world model property, opening up wider applications for future works.Video demos are on our website: https://nus-lins-lab.github.io/flipweb/.</p></details> |  |

However, they also introduce significant usability challenges, as users often struggle to provide precise camera parameters when working with arbitrary real-world images without knowledge of their depth nor scene scale. To address these real-world application issues, we propose RealCam-I2V, a novel diffusion-based video generation framework that integrates monocular metric depth estimation to establish 3D scene reconstruction in a preprocessing step. During training, the reconstructed 3D scene enables scaling camera parameters from relative to absolute values, ensuring compatibility and scale consistency across diverse real-world images. In inference, RealCam-I2V offers an intuitive interface where users can precisely draw camera trajectories by dragging within the 3D scene. To further enhance precise camera control and scene consistency, we propose scene-constrained noise shaping, which shapes high-level noise and also allows the framework to maintain dynamic, coherent video generation in lower noise stages. RealCam-I2V achieves significant improvements in controllability and video quality on the RealEstate10K and out-of-domain images. We further enables applications like camera-controlled looping video generation and generative frame interpolation. We will release our absolute-scale annotation, codes, and all checkpoints.

| **[When Video Coding Meets Multimodal Large Language Models: A Unified Paradigm for Video Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08093v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing codecs are designed to eliminate intrinsic redundancies to create a compact representation for compression. However, strong external priors from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have not been explicitly explored in video compression. Herein, we introduce a unified paradigm for Cross-Modality Video Coding (CMVC), which is a pioneering approach to explore multimodality representation and video generative models in video coding. Specifically, on the encoder side, we disentangle a video into spatial content and motion components, which are subsequently transformed into distinct modalities to achieve very compact representation by leveraging MLLMs. During decoding, previously encoded components and video generation models are leveraged to create multiple encoding-decoding modes that optimize video reconstruction quality for specific decoding requirements, including Text-Text-to-Video (TT2V) mode to ensure high-quality semantic information and Image-Text-to-Video (IT2V) mode to achieve superb perceptual consistency. In addition, we propose an efficient frame interpolation model for IT2V mode via Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) tuning to guarantee perceptual quality, which allows the generated motion cues to behave smoothly. Experiments on benchmarks indicate that TT2V achieves effective semantic reconstruction, while IT2V exhibits competitive perceptual consistency. These results highlight potential directions for future research in video coding.</p></details> |  |

However, the majority of existing VLAs fail to account for the inevitable external perturbations encountered during deployment. These perturbations introduce unforeseen state information to the VLA, resulting in inaccurate actions and consequently, a significant decline in generalization performance. The classic internal model control (IMC) principle demonstrates that a closed-loop system with an internal model that includes external input signals can accurately track the reference input and effectively offset the disturbance. We propose a novel closed-loop VLA method GEVRM that integrates the IMC principle to enhance the robustness of robot visual manipulation. The text-guided video generation model in GEVRM can generate highly expressive future visual planning goals. Simultaneously, we evaluate perturbations by simulating responses, which are called internal embeddings and optimized through prototype contrastive learning. This allows the model to implicitly infer and distinguish perturbations from the external environment. The proposed GEVRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both standard and perturbed CALVIN benchmarks and shows significant improvements in realistic robot tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, T2V generation still faces two important challenges: 1) Lacking a precise open sourced high-quality dataset. The previous popular video datasets, e.g. WebVid-10M and Panda-70M, are either with low quality or too large for most research institutions. Therefore, it is challenging but crucial to collect a precise high-quality text-video pairs for T2V generation. 2) Ignoring to fully utilize textual information. Recent T2V methods have focused on vision transformers, using a simple cross attention module for video generation, which falls short of thoroughly extracting semantic information from text prompt. To address these issues, we introduce OpenVid-1M, a precise high-quality dataset with expressive captions. This open-scenario dataset contains over 1 million text-video pairs, facilitating research on T2V generation. Furthermore, we curate 433K 1080p videos from OpenVid-1M to create OpenVidHD-0.4M, advancing high-definition video generation. Additionally, we propose a novel Multi-modal Video Diffusion Transformer (MVDiT) capable of mining both structure information from visual tokens and semantic information from text tokens.

However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals).

Our goal is to empower users with comparable controllability as professional film directors: precise placement of objects within the scene, flexible manipulation of both objects and camera in 3D space, and intuitive layout control over the rendered frames. To achieve this, CineMaster operates in two stages. In the first stage, we design an interactive workflow that allows users to intuitively construct 3D-aware conditional signals by positioning object bounding boxes and defining camera movements within the 3D space. In the second stage, these control signals--comprising rendered depth maps, camera trajectories and object class labels--serve as the guidance for a text-to-video diffusion model, ensuring to generate the user-intended video content. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of in-the-wild datasets with 3D object motion and camera pose annotations, we carefully establish an automated data annotation pipeline that extracts 3D bounding boxes and camera trajectories from large-scale video data. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that CineMaster significantly outperforms existing methods and implements prominent 3D-aware text-to-video generation.

| **[Next Block Prediction: Video Generation via Semi-Autoregressive Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07737v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next-Token Prediction (NTP) is a de facto approach for autoregressive (AR) video generation, but it suffers from suboptimal unidirectional dependencies and slow inference speed. In this work, we propose a semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation. By uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or frames), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks, allowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the corresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our framework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to capture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in parallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps, leading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores of 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an average of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps, the NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128x128 resolution) per second, achieving an 11x speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B parameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD scores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://renshuhuai-andy.github.io/NBP-project/</p></details> |

Building on this success, Lumina-Next achieves exceptional performance in the generation of photorealistic images with Next-DiT. However, its potential for video generation remains largely untapped, with significant challenges in modeling the spatiotemporal complexity inherent to video data. To address this, we introduce Lumina-Video, a framework that leverages the strengths of Next-DiT while introducing tailored solutions for video synthesis. Lumina-Video incorporates a Multi-scale Next-DiT architecture, which jointly learns multiple patchifications to enhance both efficiency and flexibility. By incorporating the motion score as an explicit condition, Lumina-Video also enables direct control of generated videos' dynamic degree. Combined with a progressive training scheme with increasingly higher resolution and FPS, and a multi-source training scheme with mixed natural and synthetic data, Lumina-Video achieves remarkable aesthetic quality and motion smoothness at high training and inference efficiency. We additionally propose Lumina-V2A, a video-to-audio model based on Next-DiT, to create synchronized sounds for generated videos.

FloVD leverages optical flow maps to represent motions of the camera and moving objects. This approach offers two key benefits. Since optical flow can be directly estimated from videos, our approach allows for the use of arbitrary training videos without ground-truth camera parameters. Moreover, as background optical flow encodes 3D correlation across different viewpoints, our method enables detailed camera control by leveraging the background motion. To synthesize natural object motion while supporting detailed camera control, our framework adopts a two-stage video synthesis pipeline consisting of optical flow generation and flow-conditioned video synthesis.

| **[Learning Human Skill Generators at Key-Step Levels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08234v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are committed to learning human skill generators at key-step levels. The generation of skills is a challenging endeavor, but its successful implementation could greatly facilitate human skill learning and provide more experience for embodied intelligence. Although current video generation models can synthesis simple and atomic human operations, they struggle with human skills due to their complex procedure process. Human skills involve multi-step, long-duration actions and complex scene transitions, so the existing naive auto-regressive methods for synthesizing long videos cannot generate human skills. To address this, we propose a novel task, the Key-step Skill Generation (KS-Gen), aimed at reducing the complexity of generating human skill videos. Given the initial state and a skill description, the task is to generate video clips of key steps to complete the skill, rather than a full-length video. To support this task, we introduce a carefully curated dataset and define multiple evaluation metrics to assess performance. Considering the complexity of KS-Gen, we propose a new framework for this task. First, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) generates descriptions for key steps using retrieval argument. Subsequently, we use a Key-step Image Generator (KIG) to address the discontinuity between key steps in skill videos. Finally, a video generation model uses these descriptions and key-step images to generate video clips of the key steps with high temporal consistency. We offer a detailed analysis of the results, hoping to provide more insights on human skill generation. All models and data are available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/KS-Gen.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyCharV: Bootstrap Controllable Character Video Generation with Fine-to-Coarse Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08189v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Character video generation is a significant real-world application focused on producing high-quality videos featuring specific characters. Recent advancements have introduced various control signals to animate static characters, successfully enhancing control over the generation process. However, these methods often lack flexibility, limiting their applicability and making it challenging for users to synthesize a source character into a desired target scene. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, AnyCharV, that flexibly generates character videos using arbitrary source characters and target scenes, guided by pose information. Our approach involves a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we develop a base model capable of integrating the source character with the target scene using pose guidance. The second stage further bootstraps controllable generation through a self-boosting mechanism, where we use the generated video in the first stage and replace the fine mask with the coarse one, enabling training outcomes with better preservation of character details. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

| **[VidCRAFT3: Camera, Object, and Lighting Control for Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07531v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image-to-video generation methods have demonstrated success in enabling control over one or two visual elements, such as camera trajectory or object motion. However, these methods are unable to offer control over multiple visual elements due to limitations in data and network efficacy. In this paper, we introduce VidCRAFT3, a novel framework for precise image-to-video generation that enables control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction simultaneously. To better decouple control over each visual element, we propose the Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer, which integrates lighting direction, text, and image in a symmetric way. Since most real-world video datasets lack lighting annotations, we construct a high-quality synthetic video dataset, the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset. This dataset includes lighting direction annotations and objects of diverse appearance, enabling VidCRAFT3 to effectively handle strong light transmission and reflection effects. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training strategy that eliminates the need for training data annotated with multiple visual elements (camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction) simultaneously. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of VidCRAFT3 in producing high-quality video content, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of control granularity and visual coherence. All code and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, the impact of these videos on the content ecosystem remains largely unexplored. Video information retrieval remains a fundamental approach for accessing video content. Building on the observation that retrieval models often favor AI-generated content in ad-hoc and image retrieval tasks, we investigate whether similar biases emerge in the context of challenging video retrieval, where temporal and visual factors may further influence model behavior. To explore this, we first construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing both real and AI-generated videos, along with a set of fair and rigorous metrics to assess bias. This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by two state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously design a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference, accounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and suboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video retrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our findings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval. Further investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the training set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference observed in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from both unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video bias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we fine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach. The results of this study highlight the potential implications of AI-generated videos on retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the text input allows us to tap into the power of modern-day video diffusion to generate plausible motion samples for the right object category and part. In turn, the input 3D object provides image prompting to personalize the generated video to that very object we wish to articulate. Our method starts with a few-shot finetuning for category-specific motion generation, a key first step to compensate for the lack of articulation awareness by current video diffusion models. For this, we finetune a pre-trained multi-view image generation model for controllable multi-view video generation, using a small collection of video samples obtained for the target object category. This is followed by motion video personalization that is realized by multi-view rendered images of the target 3D object. At last, we transfer the personalized video motion to the target 3D object via differentiable rendering to optimize part motion parameters by a score distillation sampling loss. We show that our method is capable of generating realistic motion videos and predict 3D motion parameters in a more accurate and generalizable way, compared to prior works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 16 pages</p></details> |

Despite recent advancements, existing methods struggle with accurately identifying the rhythmic or semantic triggers from audio for generating contextualized gesture patterns and achieving pixel-level realism. To address these challenges, we introduce Contextual Gesture, a framework that improves co-speech gesture video generation through three innovative components: (1) a chronological speech-gesture alignment that temporally connects two modalities, (2) a contextualized gesture tokenization that incorporate speech context into motion pattern representation through distillation, and (3) a structure-aware refinement module that employs edge connection to link gesture keypoints to improve video generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Contextual Gesture not only produces realistic and speech-aligned gesture videos but also supports long-sequence generation and video gesture editing applications, shown in Fig.1 Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Contextual-Gesture/.</p></details> |  |

Many creators repurpose their long-form videos to produce short-form videos, but creators report that planning, extracting, and arranging clips from long-form videos is challenging. Currently, creators make extractive short-form videos composed of existing long-form video clips or abstractive short-form videos by adding newly recorded narration to visuals. While extractive videos maintain the original connection between audio and visuals, abstractive videos offer flexibility in selecting content to be included in a shorter time. We present Lotus, a system that combines both approaches to balance preserving the original content with flexibility over the content. Lotus first creates an abstractive short-form video by generating both a short-form script and its corresponding speech, then matching long-form video clips to the generated narration. Creators can then add extractive clips with an automated method or Lotus's editing interface. Lotus's interface can be used to further refine the short-form video. We compare short-form videos generated by Lotus with those using an extractive baseline method. In our user study, we compare creating short-form videos using Lotus to participants' existing practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, ACM IUI 2025</p></details> |
| **[History-Guided Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06764v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a key technique for improving conditional generation in diffusion models, enabling more accurate control while enhancing sample quality. It is natural to extend this technique to video diffusion, which generates video conditioned on a variable number of context frames, collectively referred to as history. However, we find two key challenges to guiding with variable-length history: architectures that only support fixed-size conditioning, and the empirical observation that CFG-style history dropout performs poorly. To address this, we propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), a video diffusion architecture and theoretically grounded training objective that jointly enable conditioning on a flexible number of history frames. We then introduce History Guidance, a family of guidance methods uniquely enabled by DFoT. We show that its simplest form, vanilla history guidance, already significantly improves video generation quality and temporal consistency. A more advanced method, history guidance across time and frequency further enhances motion dynamics, enables compositional generalization to out-of-distribution history, and can stably roll out extremely long videos.

However, current video editing methods still suffer from several challenges. Inversion-based methods, though training-free and flexible, are time-consuming during inference, struggle with fine-grained editing instructions, and produce artifacts and jitter. On the other hand, end-to-end methods, which rely on edited video pairs for training, offer faster inference speeds but often produce poor editing results due to a lack of high-quality training video pairs. In this paper, to close the gap in end-to-end methods, we introduce Se\~norita-2M, a high-quality video editing dataset. Se\~norita-2M consists of approximately 2 millions of video editing pairs. It is built by crafting four high-quality, specialized video editing models, each crafted and trained by our team to achieve state-of-the-art editing results. We also propose a filtering pipeline to eliminate poorly edited video pairs. Furthermore, we explore common video editing architectures to identify the most effective structure based on current pre-trained generative model. Extensive experiments show that our dataset can help to yield remarkably high-quality video editing results. More details are available at https://senorita.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Existing visual imitation learning (IL) approaches rely on action chunking to model complex behaviors, which lacks the ability to respond instantly to real-time tactile feedback during the chunk execution. Furthermore, most teleoperation systems struggle to provide fine-grained tactile / force feedback, which limits the range of tasks that can be performed. To address these challenges, we introduce TactAR, a low-cost teleoperation system that provides real-time tactile feedback through Augmented Reality (AR), along with Reactive Diffusion Policy (RDP), a novel slow-fast visual-tactile imitation learning algorithm for learning contact-rich manipulation skills. RDP employs a two-level hierarchy: (1) a slow latent diffusion policy for predicting high-level action chunks in latent space at low frequency, (2) a fast asymmetric tokenizer for closed-loop tactile feedback control at high frequency. This design enables both complex trajectory modeling and quick reactive behavior within a unified framework. Through extensive evaluation across three challenging contact-rich tasks, RDP significantly improves performance compared to state-of-the-art visual IL baselines through rapid response to tactile / force feedback. Furthermore, experiments show that RDP is applicable across different tactile / force sensors. Code and videos are available on https://reactive-diffusion-policy.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Existing classifier-free guidance methods use a simple heuristic to mix conditional and unconditional scores to approximately sample from conditional distributions. However, such methods do not approximate the intermediate distributions, necessitating additional 'corrector' steps. In this work, we provide an efficient and principled method for sampling from a sequence of annealed, geometric-averaged, or product distributions derived from pretrained score-based models. We derive a weighted simulation scheme which we call Feynman-Kac Correctors (FKCs) based on the celebrated Feynman-Kac formula by carefully accounting for terms in the appropriate partial differential equations (PDEs). To simulate these PDEs, we propose Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) resampling algorithms that leverage inference-time scaling to improve sampling quality. We empirically demonstrate the utility of our methods by proposing amortized sampling via inference-time temperature annealing, improving multi-objective molecule generation using pretrained models, and improving classifier-free guidance for text-to-image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/martaskrt/fkc-diffusion.</p></details> |  |

While scaling these models up to billions of parameters shows promise, the effectiveness of scaling beyond current sizes remains underexplored and challenging. By explicitly exploiting the computational heterogeneity of image generations, we develop a new family of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models (EC-DIT) for diffusion transformers with expert-choice routing. EC-DIT learns to adaptively optimize the compute allocated to understand the input texts and generate the respective image patches, enabling heterogeneous computation aligned with varying text-image complexities. This heterogeneity provides an efficient way of scaling EC-DIT up to 97 billion parameters and achieving significant improvements in training convergence, text-to-image alignment, and overall generation quality over dense models and conventional MoE models. Through extensive ablations, we show that EC-DIT demonstrates superior scalability and adaptive compute allocation by recognizing varying textual importance through end-to-end training. Notably, in text-to-image alignment evaluation, our largest models achieve a state-of-the-art GenEval score of 71.68% and still maintain competitive inference speed with intuitive interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Variable-friction manipulation is an alternative approach to dexterity, previously demonstrating robust and versatile 2D IHM capabilities with only two single-joint fingers. However, the hard-coded manipulation methods for variable friction hands are restricted to regular polygon objects and limited target poses, as well as requiring the policy to be tailored for each object. This paper proposes an end-to-end learning-based manipulation method to achieve arbitrary object manipulation for any target pose on real hardware, with minimal engineering efforts and data collection. The method features a diffusion policy-based imitation learning method with co-training from simulation and a small amount of real-world data. With the proposed framework, arbitrary objects including polygons and non-polygons can be precisely manipulated to reach arbitrary goal poses within 2 hours of training on an A100 GPU and only 1 hour of real-world data collection. The precision is higher than previous customized object-specific policies, achieving an average success rate of 71.3% with average pose error being 2.676 mm and 1.902 degrees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025 Project website: https://sites.google.com/view/vf-ihm-il/home</p></details> |

Specifically, we propose to use a denoising model to sample eigenvectors and eigenvalues from which we can reconstruct the graph Laplacian and adjacency matrix. Using the Laplacian spectrum allows us to naturally capture the structural characteristics of the graph and work directly in the node space while avoiding the quadratic complexity bottleneck that limits the applicability of other diffusion-based methods. This, in turn, is accomplished by truncating the spectrum, which, as we show in our experiments, results in a faster yet accurate generative process, and by designing a novel transformer-based architecture linear in the number of nodes. Our permutation invariant model can also handle node features by concatenating them to the eigenvectors of each node. An extensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real-world graphs demonstrates the strengths of our model against state-of-the-art alternatives.</p></details> |  |

Our results extend to continuous mixtures of Gaussians where the mixing distribution is supported on a union of $k$ balls of constant radius. In particular, this applies to the case of Gaussian convolutions of distributions on low-dimensional manifolds, or more generally sets with small covering number, for which no sub-exponential algorithm was previously known. Unlike previous approaches, most of which are algebraic in nature, our approach is analytic and relies on the framework of diffusion models. Diffusion models are a modern paradigm for generative modeling, which typically rely on learning the score function (gradient log-pdf) along a process transforming a pure noise distribution, in our case a Gaussian, to the data distribution. Despite their dazzling performance in tasks such as image generation, there are few end-to-end theoretical guarantees that they can efficiently learn nontrivial families of distributions; we give some of the first such guarantees. We proceed by deriving higher-order Gaussian noise sensitivity bounds for the score functions for a Gaussian mixture to show that that they can be inductively learned using piecewise polynomial regression (up to poly-logarithmic degree), and combine this with known convergence results for diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches have traditionally been treated as distinct methodologies with separate optimization frameworks. In this work, we establish a unified perspective that connects MPPI, RL, and Diffusion Models through gradient-based optimization on the Gibbs measure. We first show that MPPI can be interpreted as performing gradient ascent on a smoothed energy function. We then demonstrate that Policy Gradient methods reduce to MPPI by applying an exponential transformation to the objective function. Additionally, we establish that the reverse sampling process in diffusion models follows the same update rule as MPPI.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated RL subsection in Main section</p></details> |

Our system enables complex in-hand manipulation tasks, such as unscrewing a bottle lid with one hand, by leveraging a fast and responsive teleoperation setup for the four-fingered Allegro Hand. We collect high-quality expert demonstrations using an augmented reality (AR) interface that tracks hand movements and applies inverse kinematics and motion retargeting for precise control. The AR headset provides real-time visualization, while gesture controls streamline teleoperation. To enhance policy learning, we introduce a novel demonstration outlier removal approach based on HDBSCAN clustering and the Global-Local Outlier Score from Hierarchies (GLOSH) algorithm, effectively filtering out low-quality demonstrations that could degrade performance. We evaluate our approach extensively in real-world settings and provide all experimental videos on the project website: https://dex-manip.github.io/</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map generation studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning capabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling complex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with Centerline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior knowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building BEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local mapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely visual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates historical information into mapping generation by applying transformation matrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module based on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through spatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction. We construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public nuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method improves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and 240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping. TS-CGNet attains an improvement of 1.92% for perceived ranges of 100x100m in the task of BEV semantic mapping. Moreover, TS-CGNet achieves an average improvement of 2.92% in detection accuracy under varying weather conditions and sensor interferences in the perception range of 240x60m.

However, their lengthy denoising process and computationally intensive score estimation network impede their scalability in low-latency and resource-constrained scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses and accelerates diffusion models without retraining, but it inevitably introduces additional quantization noise, resulting in mean and variance deviations. In this work, we propose D2-DPM, a dual denoising mechanism aimed at precisely mitigating the adverse effects of quantization noise on the noise estimation network. Specifically, we first unravel the impact of quantization noise on the sampling equation into two components: the mean deviation and the variance deviation. The mean deviation alters the drift coefficient of the sampling equation, influencing the trajectory trend, while the variance deviation magnifies the diffusion coefficient, impacting the convergence of the sampling trajectory. The proposed D2-DPM is thus devised to denoise the quantization noise at each time step, and then denoise the noisy sample through the inverse diffusion iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that D2-DPM achieves superior generation quality, yielding a 1.42 lower FID than the full-precision model while achieving 3.99x compression and 11.67x bit-operation acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, acceptted by AAAI2025, the code is available at https://github.com/taylorjocelyn/d2-dpm</p></details> |

Streamline-based registration approaches can leverage the 3D geometric information of fiber pathways to enable spatial alignment after registration. Existing methods usually rely on the optimization of the spatial distances to identify the optimal transformation. However, such methods overlook point connectivity patterns within the streamline itself, limiting their ability to identify anatomical correspondences across tractography datasets. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised approach using deep learning to perform streamline-based dMRI tractography registration. The overall idea is to identify corresponding keypoint pairs across subjects for spatial alignment of tractography datasets. We model tractography as point clouds to leverage the graph connectivity along streamlines. We propose a novel keypoint detection method for streamlines, framed as a probabilistic classification task to identify anatomically consistent correspondences across unstructured streamline sets. In the experiments, we compare several existing methods and show highly effective and efficient tractography registration performance.</p></details> |  |

Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy optimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive to hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE, on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose leave-one-out PPO ( LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP combines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling multiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the robustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling. Our results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on various black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between computational efficiency and performance.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional differentiable filters, which often impose restrictive assumptions on process noise (e.g., Gaussianity), DnD Filter enables a nonlinear state update without such constraints by conditioning a diffusion model on both the predicted state and observational data, capitalizing on its ability to approximate complex distributions. We validate its effectiveness on both a simulated task and a real-world visual odometry task, where DnD Filter consistently outperforms existing baselines. Specifically, it achieves a 25\% improvement in estimation accuracy on the visual odometry task compared to state-of-the-art differentiable filters, and even surpasses differentiable smoothers that utilize future measurements. To the best of our knowledge, DnD Filter represents the first successful attempt to leverage diffusion models for state estimation, offering a flexible and powerful framework for nonlinear estimation under noisy measurements.</p></details> |  |

However, a key challenge remains: ensuring precise control over the generated outcomes without compromising realism. This is crucial for applications such as motion planning or trajectory forecasting, where adherence to physical constraints and task-specific objectives is essential. We propose a novel framework that enhances controllability in diffusion models by leveraging multi-modal prior distributions and enforcing strong modal coupling. This allows us to initiate the denoising process directly from distinct prior modes that correspond to different possible system behaviors, ensuring sampling to align with the training distribution. We evaluate our approach on motion prediction using the Waymo dataset and multi-task control in Maze2D environments. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms both guidance-based techniques and conditioned models with unimodal priors, achieving superior fidelity, diversity, and controllability, even in the absence of explicit conditioning. Overall, our approach provides a more reliable and scalable solution for controllable motion generation in robotics.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in quantum computing, particularly the integration of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with classical machine learning architectures, offer new opportunities to develop models that may outperform traditional methods. However, quantum machine learning (QML) remains in its early stages and requires further experimental analysis to better understand its behavior and limitations. In this paper, we propose an end to end hybrid classical quantum convolutional neural network (CQ CNN) for AD detection using clinically formatted 3D MRI data. Our approach involves developing a framework to make 3D MRI data usable for machine learning, designing and training a brain tissue segmentation model (Skull Net), and training a diffusion model to generate synthetic images for the minority class. Our converged models exhibit potential quantum advantages, achieving higher accuracy in fewer epochs than classical models. The proposed beta8 3 qubit model achieves an accuracy of 97.50%, surpassing state of the art (SOTA) models while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. In particular, the architecture employs only 13K parameters (0.48 MB), reducing the parameter count by more than 99.99% compared to current SOTA models. Furthermore, the diffusion-generated data used to train our quantum models, in conjunction with real samples, preserve clinical structural standards, representing a notable first in the field of QML. We conclude that CQCNN architecture like models, with further improvements in gradient optimization techniques, could become a viable option and even a potential alternative to classical models for AD detection, especially in data limited and resource constrained clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appli...</summary><p>Application of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning for (early stage) disease detection</p></details> |

However, despite the perception stability in harsh environments, the point cloud generated by mmWave radar is relatively sparse while containing significant noise, which limits its further development. Traditional mmWave radar enhancement approaches often struggle to leverage the effectiveness of diffusion models in super-resolution, largely due to the unnatural range-azimuth heatmap (RAH) or bird's eye view (BEV) representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method that pioneers the application of fusing range images with image diffusion models, achieving accurate and dense mmWave radar point clouds that are similar to LiDAR. Benefitting from the projection that aligns with human observation, the range image representation of mmWave radar is close to natural images, allowing the knowledge from pre-trained image diffusion models to be effectively transferred, significantly improving the overall performance. Extensive evaluations on both public datasets and self-constructed datasets demonstrate that our approach provides substantial improvements, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in generating truly three-dimensional LiDAR-like point clouds via mmWave radar.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to 2025 IROS.

| **[PatternPaint: Practical Layout Pattern Generation Using Diffusion-Based Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01348v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating diverse VLSI layout patterns is essential for various downstream tasks in design for manufacturing, as design rules continually evolve during the development of new technology nodes. However, existing training-based methods for layout pattern generation rely on large datasets. In practical scenarios, especially when developing a new technology node, obtaining such extensive layout data is challenging. Consequently, training models with large datasets becomes impractical, limiting the scalability and adaptability of prior approaches. To this end, we propose PatternPaint, a diffusion-based framework capable of generating legal patterns with limited design-rule-compliant training samples. PatternPaint simplifies complex layout pattern generation into a series of inpainting processes with a template-based denoising scheme. Furthermore, we perform few-shot finetuning on a pretrained image foundation model with only 20 design-rule-compliant samples. Experimental results show that using a sub-3nm technology node (Intel 18A), our model is the only one that can generate legal patterns in complex 2D metal interconnect design rule settings among all previous works and achieves a high diversity score. Additionally, our few-shot finetuning can boost the legality rate with 1.87X improvement compared to the original pretrained model. As a result, we demonstrate a production-ready approach for layout pattern generation in developing new technology nodes.</p></details> |  |

Among various quantum generative models, quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models (QuDDPMs) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 100602 (2024)] provide a promising approach with stepwise learning that resolves the training issues. However, the requirement of high-fidelity scrambling unitaries in QuDDPM poses a challenge in near-term implementation. We propose the \textit{mixed-state quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model} (MSQuDDPM) to eliminate the need for scrambling unitaries. Our approach focuses on adapting the quantum noise channels to the model architecture, which integrates depolarizing noise channels in the forward diffusion process and parameterized quantum circuits with projective measurements in the backward denoising steps. We also introduce several techniques to improve MSQuDDPM, including a cosine-exponent schedule of noise interpolation, the use of single-qubit random ancilla, and superfidelity-based cost functions to enhance the convergence. We evaluate MSQuDDPM on quantum ensemble generation tasks, demonstrating its successful performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures; Fig.8 added, appendix C added</p></details> |

To address this, we present TweedieMix, a novel method for composing customized diffusion models during the inference phase. By analyzing the properties of reverse diffusion sampling, our approach divides the sampling process into two stages. During the initial steps, we apply a multiple object-aware sampling technique to ensure the inclusion of the desired target objects. In the later steps, we blend the appearances of the custom concepts in the de-noised image space using Tweedie's formula. Our results demonstrate that TweedieMix can generate multiple personalized concepts with higher fidelity than existing methods.

However, due to inherent issues in imaging principles, it faces significant challenges including spatially varying noise and anisotropic resolution, where the axial resolution lags behind the lateral resolution up to 4.5 times. Meanwhile, laser power is kept low to maintain cell viability, leading to inaccessible low-noise and high-resolution paired ground truth (GT). To tackle these limitations, a dual Cycle-consistent Diffusion is proposed to effectively mine intra-volume imaging priors within 3D cell volumes in an unsupervised manner, i.e., Volume Tells (VTCD), achieving de-noising and super-resolution (SR) simultaneously. Specifically, a spatially iso-distributed denoiser is designed to exploit the noise distribution consistency between adjacent low-noise and high-noise regions within the 3D cell volume, suppressing the spatially varying noise. Then, in light of the structural consistency of the cell volume, a cross-plane global-propagation SR module propagates high-resolution details from the XY plane into adjacent regions in the XZ and YZ planes, progressively enhancing resolution across the entire 3D cell volume. Experimental results on 10 in vivo cellular dataset demonstrate high improvements in both denoising and super-resolution, with axial resolution enhanced from ~ 430 nm to ~ 90 nm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Most current social simulation research emphasizes interactive behaviors in fixed environments, ignoring information opacity, relationship variability and diffusion diversity. In this paper, we study the dynamics of information diffusion in 12 asymmetric open environments defined by information content and distribution mechanisms. We first present a general framework to capture the features of information diffusion. Then, we designed a dynamic attention mechanism to help agents allocate attention to different information, addressing the limitations of LLM-based attention. Agents start by responding to external information stimuli within a five-agent group, increasing group size and forming information circles while developing relationships and sharing information. Additionally, we observe the emergence of information cocoons, the evolution of information gaps, and the accumulation of social capital, which are closely linked to psychological, sociological, and communication theories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Finding Local Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19754v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In image generation, Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB)-based methods theoretically enhance the efficiency and quality compared to the diffusion models by finding the least costly path between two distributions. However, they are computationally expensive and time-consuming when applied to complex image data. The reason is that they focus on fitting globally optimal paths in high-dimensional spaces, directly generating images as next step on the path using complex networks through self-supervised training, which typically results in a gap with the global optimum. Meanwhile, most diffusion models are in the same path subspace generated by weights $f_A(t)$ and $f_B(t)$, as they follow the paradigm ($x_t = f_A(t)x_{Img} + f_B(t)\epsilon$). To address the limitations of SB-based methods, this paper proposes for the first time to find local Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridges (LDSB) in the diffusion path subspace, which strengthens the connection between the SB problem and diffusion models. Specifically, our method optimizes the diffusion paths using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which has the advantage of resistance to forgetting and continuous output. The experiment shows that our LDSB significantly improves the quality and efficiency of image generation using the same pre-trained denoising network and the KAN for optimising is only less than 0.1MB. The FID metric is reduced by more than 15\%, especially with a reduction of 48.50\% when NFE of DDIM is $5$ for the CelebA dataset.

This approach modifies the backward process of a pretrained diffusion model to construct a bridge that converges to an implicit distribution associated with the editing target at time 0. Building on this framework, we propose h-Edit, a novel editing method that utilizes Doob's h-transform and Langevin Monte Carlo to decompose the update of an intermediate edited sample into two components: a "reconstruction" term and an "editing" term. This decomposition provides flexibility, allowing the reconstruction term to be computed via existing inversion techniques and enabling the combination of multiple editing terms to handle complex editing tasks. To our knowledge, h-Edit is the first training-free method capable of performing simultaneous text-guided and reward-model-based editing. Extensive experiments, both quantitative and qualitative, show that h-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of editing effectiveness and faithfulness.

| **[Language-Informed Hyperspectral Image Synthesis for Imbalanced-Small Sample Classification via Semi-Supervised Conditional Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19700v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation effectively addresses the imbalanced-small sample data (ISSD) problem in hyperspectral image classification (HSIC). While most methodologies extend features in the latent space, few leverage text-driven generation to create realistic and diverse samples. Recently, text-guided diffusion models have gained significant attention due to their ability to generate highly diverse and high-quality images based on text prompts in natural image synthesis. Motivated by this, this paper proposes Txt2HSI-LDM(VAE), a novel language-informed hyperspectral image synthesis method to address the ISSD in HSIC. The proposed approach uses a denoising diffusion model, which iteratively removes Gaussian noise to generate hyperspectral samples conditioned on textual descriptions. First, to address the high-dimensionality of hyperspectral data, a universal variational autoencoder (VAE) is designed to map the data into a low-dimensional latent space, which provides stable features and reduces the inference complexity of diffusion model. Second, a semi-supervised diffusion model is designed to fully take advantage of unlabeled data. Random polygon spatial clipping (RPSC) and uncertainty estimation of latent feature (LF-UE) are used to simulate the varying degrees of mixing. Third, the VAE decodes HSI from latent space generated by the diffusion model with the language conditions as input. In our experiments, we fully evaluate synthetic samples' effectiveness from statistical characteristics and data distribution in 2D-PCA space. Additionally, visual-linguistic cross-attention is visualized on the pixel level to prove that our proposed model can capture the spatial layout and geometry of the generated data. Experiments demonstrate that the performance of the proposed Txt2HSI-LDM(VAE) surpasses the classical backbone models, state-of-the-art CNNs, and semi-supervised methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional training methods often rely on the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence due to its tractability. However, the mode-seeking behavior of reverse KL hinders effective approximation of multi-modal target distributions. To address this, we propose to minimize the reverse KL along diffusion trajectories of both model and target densities. We refer to this objective as the reverse diffusive KL divergence, which allows the model to capture multiple modes. Leveraging this objective, we train neural samplers that can efficiently generate samples from the target distribution in one step. We demonstrate that our method enhances sampling performance across various Boltzmann distributions, including both synthetic multi-modal densities and n-body particle systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[HanDrawer: Leveraging Spatial Information to Render Realistic Hands Using a Conditional Diffusion Model in Single Stage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02127v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion methods excel in text-to-image generation, generating accurate hand gestures remains a major challenge, resulting in severe artifacts, such as incorrect number of fingers or unnatural gestures. To enable the diffusion model to learn spatial information to improve the quality of the hands generated, we propose HanDrawer, a module to condition the hand generation process. Specifically, we apply graph convolutional layers to extract the endogenous spatial structure and physical constraints implicit in MANO hand mesh vertices. We then align and fuse these spatial features with other modalities via cross-attention. The spatially fused features are used to guide a single stage diffusion model denoising process for high quality generation of the hand region. To improve the accuracy of spatial feature fusion, we propose a Position-Preserving Zero Padding (PPZP) fusion strategy, which ensures that the features extracted by HanDrawer are fused into the region of interest in the relevant layers of the diffusion model. HanDrawer learns the entire image features while paying special attention to the hand region thanks to an additional hand reconstruction loss combined with the denoising loss. To accurately train and evaluate our approach, we perform careful cleansing and relabeling of the widely used HaGRID hand gesture dataset and obtain high quality multimodal data. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on the HaGRID dataset through multiple evaluation metrics. Source code and our enhanced dataset will be released publicly if the paper is accepted.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This task remains challenging due to complex variations in real-world applications. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in diverse scene generation, which inspires us to explore their potential for improving DG tasks. Instead of generating images, our method extracts multi-step intermediate features during the diffusion process to obtain domain-invariant features for generalized detection. Furthermore, we propose an efficient knowledge transfer framework that enables detectors to inherit the generalization capabilities of diffusion models through feature and object-level alignment, without increasing inference time. We conduct extensive experiments on six challenging DG benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements of 14.0% mAP over existing DG approaches across different domains and corruption types. Notably, our method even outperforms most domain adaptation methods without accessing any target domain data. Moreover, the diffusion-guided detectors show consistent improvements of 15.9% mAP on average compared to the baseline. Our work aims to present an effective approach for domain-generalized detection and provide potential insights for robust visual recognition in real-world scenarios.

| **[FRMD: Fast Robot Motion Diffusion with Consistency-Distilled Movement Primitives for Smooth Action Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02048v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of using diffusion models to generate fast, smooth, and temporally consistent robot motions. Although diffusion models have demonstrated superior performance in robot learning due to their task scalability and multi-modal flexibility, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (1) they often produce non-smooth, jerky motions due to their inability to capture temporally consistent movement dynamics, and (2) their iterative sampling process incurs prohibitive latency for many robotic tasks. Inspired by classic robot motion generation methods such as DMPs and ProMPs, which capture temporally and spatially consistent dynamic of trajectories using low-dimensional vectors -- and by recent advances in diffusion-based image generation that use consistency models with probability flow ODEs to accelerate the denoising process, we propose Fast Robot Motion Diffusion (FRMD). FRMD uniquely integrates Movement Primitives (MPs) with Consistency Models to enable efficient, single-step trajectory generation. By leveraging probabilistic flow ODEs and consistency distillation, our method models trajectory distributions while learning a compact, time-continuous motion representation within an encoder-decoder architecture. This unified approach eliminates the slow, multi-step denoising process of conventional diffusion models, enabling efficient one-step inference and smooth robot motion generation. We extensively evaluated our FRMD on the well-recognized Meta-World and ManiSkills Benchmarks, ranging from simple to more complex manipulation tasks, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art baselines. Our results show that FRMD generates significantly faster, smoother trajectories while achieving higher success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.01586 by other authors</p></details> |

Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Framework for Crediting Data Contributors of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03153v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As diffusion models are deployed in real-world settings, and their performance is driven by training data, appraising the contribution of data contributors is crucial to creating incentives for sharing quality data and to implementing policies for data compensation. Depending on the use case, model performance corresponds to various global properties of the distribution learned by a diffusion model (e.g., overall aesthetic quality). Hence, here we address the problem of attributing global properties of diffusion models to data contributors. The Shapley value provides a principled approach to valuation by uniquely satisfying game-theoretic axioms of fairness. However, estimating Shapley values for diffusion models is computationally impractical because it requires retraining on many training data subsets corresponding to different contributors and rerunning inference. We introduce a method to efficiently retrain and rerun inference for Shapley value estimation, by leveraging model pruning and fine-tuning. We evaluate the utility of our method with three use cases: (i) image quality for a DDPM trained on a CIFAR dataset, (ii) demographic diversity for an LDM trained on CelebA-HQ, and (iii) aesthetic quality for a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on Post-Impressionist artworks. Our results empirically demonstrate that our framework can identify important data contributors across models' global properties, outperforming existing attribution methods for diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Despite substantial progress, existing methods lack broad generalization capabilities and require category-specific training data. To address these limitations, we propose a fundamentally new approach to shape correspondence based on denoising diffusion models. In our method, a diffusion model learns to directly predict the functional map, a low-dimensional representation of a point-wise map between shapes. We use a large dataset of synthetic human meshes for training and employ two steps to reduce the number of functional maps that need to be learned. First, the maps refer to a template rather than shape pairs. Second, the functional map is defined in a basis of eigenvectors of the Laplacian, which is not unique due to sign ambiguity. Therefore, we introduce an unsupervised approach to select a specific basis by correcting the signs of eigenvectors based on surface features. Our approach achieves competitive performance on standard human datasets, meshes with anisotropic connectivity, non-isometric humanoid shapes, as well as animals compared to existing descriptor-based and large-scale shape deformation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025; Project page: https://alekseizhuravlev.github.io/denoising-functional-maps/</p></details> |

However, as they scale, rising memory demands and higher latency pose substantial deployment challenges. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing their weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both weights and activations are highly sensitive, where existing post-training quantization methods like smoothing become insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit quantization paradigm. Different from smoothing, which redistributes outliers between weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a low-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from activations to weights. Then, we use a high-precision, low-rank branch to take in the weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), while a low-bit quantized branch handles the residuals. This process eases the quantization on both sides. However, naively running the low-rank branch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of activations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design an inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into those of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also seamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without re-quantization. Extensive experiments on SDXL, PixArt-$\Sigma$, and FLUX.1 validate the effectiveness of SVDQuant in preserving image quality. We reduce the memory usage for the 12B FLUX.1 models by 3.5$\times$, achieving 3.0$\times$ speedup over the 4-bit weight-only quantization (W4A16) baseline on the 16GB laptop 4090 GPU with INT4 precision.

However, achieving photorealistic rendering from extreme novel viewpoints remains challenging, as artifacts persist across representations. In this work, we introduce Difix3D+, a novel pipeline designed to enhance 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis through single-step diffusion models. At the core of our approach is Difix, a single-step image diffusion model trained to enhance and remove artifacts in rendered novel views caused by underconstrained regions of the 3D representation. Difix serves two critical roles in our pipeline. First, it is used during the reconstruction phase to clean up pseudo-training views that are rendered from the reconstruction and then distilled back into 3D. This greatly enhances underconstrained regions and improves the overall 3D representation quality. More importantly, Difix also acts as a neural enhancer during inference, effectively removing residual artifacts arising from imperfect 3D supervision and the limited capacity of current reconstruction models. Difix3D+ is a general solution, a single model compatible with both NeRF and 3DGS representations, and it achieves an average 2$\times$ improvement in FID score over baselines while maintaining 3D consistency.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

A primary challenge lies in generating accurate and style-consistent textual and visual content. Existing works in a related task of visual text generation often focus on generating text within given specific regions, which limits the creativity of generation models, resulting in style or color inconsistencies between textual and visual elements if applied to design image generation. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end, one-stage diffusion-based framework that avoids intricate components like position and layout modeling. Specifically, the proposed framework directly synthesizes textual and visual design elements from user prompts. It utilizes a distinctive character embedding derived from the visual text to enhance the input prompt, along with a character localization loss for enhanced supervision during text generation. Furthermore, we employ a self-play Direct Preference Optimization fine-tuning strategy to improve the quality and accuracy of the synthesized visual text.

However, they typically perform well in scenes with a single object and motion, struggling in compositional scenarios with multiple objects and distinct motions to accurately reflect the semantic content of text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{StarVid}, a plug-and-play, training-free method that improves semantic alignment between multiple subjects, their motions, and text prompts in T2V models. StarVid first leverages the spatial reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for two-stage motion trajectory planning based on text prompts. Such trajectories serve as spatial priors, guiding a spatial-aware loss to refocus cross-attention (CA) maps into distinctive regions. Furthermore, we propose a syntax-guided contrastive constraint to strengthen the correlation between the CA maps of verbs and their corresponding nouns, enhancing motion-subject binding. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline methods, delivering videos of higher quality with improved semantic consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Aligned Diffusion Planner for Quadrupedal Locomotion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13586v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex distributions from large-scale datasets, providing a promising solution for quadrupedal locomotion control. However, the robustness of the diffusion planner is inherently dependent on the diversity of the pre-collected datasets. To mitigate this issue, we propose a two-stage learning framework to enhance the capability of the diffusion planner under limited dataset (reward-agnostic). Through the offline stage, the diffusion planner learns the joint distribution of state-action sequences from expert datasets without using reward labels. Subsequently, we perform the online interaction in the simulation environment based on the trained offline planner, which significantly diversified the original behavior and thus improves the robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel weak preference labeling method without the ground-truth reward or human preferences. The proposed method exhibits superior stability and velocity tracking accuracy in pacing, trotting, and bounding gait under different speeds and can perform a zero-shot transfer to the real Unitree Go1 robots.

| **[MRI super-resolution reconstruction using efficient diffusion probabilistic model with residual shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01576v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective:This study introduces a residual error-shifting mechanism that drastically reduces sampling steps while preserving critical anatomical details, thus accelerating MRI reconstruction. Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.

| **[Divide and Conquer: Heterogeneous Noise Integration for Diffusion-based Adversarial Purification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01407v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing diffusion-based purification methods aim to disrupt adversarial perturbations by introducing a certain amount of noise through a forward diffusion process, followed by a reverse process to recover clean examples. However, this approach is fundamentally flawed: the uniform operation of the forward process across all pixels compromises normal pixels while attempting to combat adversarial perturbations, resulting in the target model producing incorrect predictions. Simply relying on low-intensity noise is insufficient for effective defense. To address this critical issue, we implement a heterogeneous purification strategy grounded in the interpretability of neural networks. Our method decisively applies higher-intensity noise to specific pixels that the target model focuses on while the remaining pixels are subjected to only low-intensity noise. This requirement motivates us to redesign the sampling process of the diffusion model, allowing for the effective removal of varying noise levels. Furthermore, to evaluate our method against strong adaptative attack, our proposed method sharply reduces time cost and memory usage through a single-step resampling. The empirical evidence from extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms most current adversarial training and purification techniques by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Training One-Step Diffusion Models Without Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08005v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in one-step generative models typically follow a two-stage process: first training a teacher diffusion model and then distilling it into a one-step student model. This distillation process traditionally relies on both the teacher model's score function to compute the distillation loss and its weights for student initialization. In this paper, we explore whether one-step generative models can be trained directly without this distillation process. First, we show that the teacher's score function is not essential and propose a family of distillation methods that achieve competitive results without relying on score estimation. Next, we demonstrate that initialization from teacher weights is indispensable in successful training. Surprisingly, we find that this benefit is not due to improved ``input-output" mapping but rather the learned feature representations, which dominate distillation quality. Our findings provide a better understanding of the role of initialization in one-step model training and its impact on distillation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Technical Report</p></details> |

However, the quality and generalizability of 3D content generation remain limited. State-of-the-art methods often require large-scale 3D assets for training, which are challenging to collect. In this work, we introduce Kiss3DGen (Keep It Simple and Straightforward in 3D Generation), an efficient framework for generating, editing, and enhancing 3D objects by repurposing a well-trained 2D image diffusion model for 3D generation. Specifically, we fine-tune a diffusion model to generate ''3D Bundle Image'', a tiled representation composed of multi-view images and their corresponding normal maps. The normal maps are then used to reconstruct a 3D mesh, and the multi-view images provide texture mapping, resulting in a complete 3D model. This simple method effectively transforms the 3D generation problem into a 2D image generation task, maximizing the utilization of knowledge in pretrained diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our Kiss3DGen model is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as 3D editing, mesh and texture enhancement, etc. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its ability to produce high-quality 3D models efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Moreover, converting the polarimetric Mueller Matrix (MM) to standardized stained images becomes a promising approach to help pathologists interpret the results. However, existing methods for polarization-based virtual staining are still in the early stage, and the diffusion-based model, which has shown great potential in enhancing the fidelity of the generated images, has not been studied yet. In this paper, a Regulated Bridge Diffusion Model (RBDM) for polarization-based virtual staining is proposed. RBDM utilizes the bidirectional bridge diffusion process to learn the mapping from polarization images to other modalities such as H\&E and fluorescence. And to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct the experiment on our manually collected dataset, which consists of 18,000 paired polarization, fluorescence and H\&E images, due to the unavailability of the public dataset. The experiment results show that our model greatly outperforms other benchmark methods. Our dataset and code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CacheQuant: Comprehensively Accelerated Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01323v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have gradually gained prominence in the field of image synthesis, showcasing remarkable generative capabilities. Nevertheless, the slow inference and complex networks, resulting from redundancy at both temporal and structural levels, hinder their low-latency applications in real-world scenarios. Current acceleration methods for diffusion models focus separately on temporal and structural levels. However, independent optimization at each level to further push the acceleration limits results in significant performance degradation. On the other hand, integrating optimizations at both levels can compound the acceleration effects. Unfortunately, we find that the optimizations at these two levels are not entirely orthogonal. Performing separate optimizations and then simply integrating them results in unsatisfactory performance. To tackle this issue, we propose CacheQuant, a novel training-free paradigm that comprehensively accelerates diffusion models by jointly optimizing model caching and quantization techniques. Specifically, we employ a dynamic programming approach to determine the optimal cache schedule, in which the properties of caching and quantization are carefully considered to minimize errors. Additionally, we propose decoupled error correction to further mitigate the coupled and accumulated errors step by step. Experimental results show that CacheQuant achieves a 5.18 speedup and 4 compression for Stable Diffusion on MS-COCO, with only a 0.02 loss in CLIP score.

While item-based CF (ItemCF) enhances diversity through item similarity, it compromises accuracy. Conversely, mass diffusion (MD) algorithms prioritize accuracy by favoring popular items but lack diversity. To address this trade-off, we propose the HI-series algorithms, hybrid models integrating ItemCF with diffusion-based approaches (MD, HHP, BHC, BD) through a nonlinear combination controlled by parameter $\epsilon$. This hybridization leverages ItemCF's diversity and MD's accuracy, extending to advanced diffusion models (HI-HHP, HI-BHC, HI-BD) for enhanced performance. Experiments on MovieLens, Netflix, and RYM datasets demonstrate that HI-series algorithms significantly outperform their base counterparts. In sparse data ($20\%$ training), HI-MD achieves a $0.8\%$-$4.4\%$ improvement in F1-score over MD while maintaining higher diversity (Diversity@20: 459 vs. 396 on MovieLens). For dense data ($80\%$ training), HI-BD improves F1-score by $2.3\%$-$5.2\%$ compared to BD, with diversity gains up to $18.6\%$. Notably, hybrid models consistently enhance novelty in sparse settings and exhibit robust parameter adaptability. The results validate that strategic hybridization effectively breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, offering a flexible framework for optimizing recommendation systems across data sparsity levels.</p></details> |  |

More recently, a sampling-based variant of this approach, which utilizes a pre-trained \textit{generative diffusion model}, has gained great popularity for solving IR problems through stochastic sampling. The IR results using PnP with a pre-trained diffusion model demonstrate distinct advantages compared to those using discriminative denoisers, \ie improved perceptual quality while sacrificing the data fidelity. The unsatisfactory results are due to the lack of integration of these strategies in the IR tasks. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot IR scheme, dubbed Reconciling Diffusion Model in Dual (RDMD), which leverages only a \textbf{single} pre-trained diffusion model to construct \textbf{two} complementary regularizers. Specifically, the diffusion model in RDMD will iteratively perform deterministic denoising and stochastic sampling, aiming to achieve high-fidelity image restoration with appealing perceptual quality. RDMD also allows users to customize the distortion-perception tradeoff with a single hyperparameter, enhancing the adaptability of the restoration process in different practical scenarios. Extensive experiments on several IR tasks demonstrate that our proposed method could achieve superior results compared to existing approaches on both the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the potential of VDMs for creating transparent videos remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we introduce TransVDM, the first diffusion-based model specifically designed for transparent video generation. TransVDM integrates a Transparent Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) and a pretrained UNet-based VDM, along with a novel Alpha Motion Constraint Module (AMCM). The TVAE captures the alpha channel transparency of video frames and encodes it into the latent space of the VDMs, facilitating a seamless transition to transparent video diffusion models. To improve the detection of transparent areas, the AMCM integrates motion constraints from the foreground within the VDM, helping to reduce undesirable artifacts. Moreover, we curate a dataset containing 250K transparent frames for training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

| **[GDTS: Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for Multi-Modal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14922v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for improving the safety of autonomous driving. However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Stabilizer Policy for Automated Surgical Robot Manipulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01252v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent surgical robots have the potential to revolutionize clinical practice by enabling more precise and automated surgical procedures. However, the automation of such robot for surgical tasks remains under-explored compared to recent advancements in solving household manipulation tasks. These successes have been largely driven by (1) advanced models, such as transformers and diffusion models, and (2) large-scale data utilization. Aiming to extend these successes to the domain of surgical robotics, we propose a diffusion-based policy learning framework, called Diffusion Stabilizer Policy (DSP), which enables training with imperfect or even failed trajectories. Our approach consists of two stages: first, we train the diffusion stabilizer policy using only clean data. Then, the policy is continuously updated using a mixture of clean and perturbed data, with filtering based on the prediction error on actions. Comprehensive experiments conducted in various surgical environments demonstrate the superior performance of our method in perturbation-free settings and its robustness when handling perturbed demonstrations.</p></details> | Under-review |

Based on the techniques of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models, which are inequalities that relate the accuracy of data generation to the entropy production rate, which can be interpreted as the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the non-conservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide a quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models with different noise schedules and the different data. We numerically discuss our results for the optimal and suboptimal learning protocols. We also show the inaccurate data generation due to the non-conservative force, and the applicability of our results to data generation from the real-world image datasets.</p></details> | 36 pages, 7 figures |

Despite its popularity, the limitations of infrared cameras, such as low spatial resolution and complex degradations, consistently challenge imaging quality and subsequent visual tasks. Hence, infrared image super-resolution (IISR) has been developed to address this challenge. While recent developments in diffusion models have greatly advanced this field, current methods to solve it either ignore the unique modal characteristics of infrared imaging or overlook the machine perception requirements. To bridge these gaps, we propose DifIISR, an infrared image super-resolution diffusion model optimized for visual quality and perceptual performance. Our approach achieves task-based guidance for diffusion by injecting gradients derived from visual and perceptual priors into the noise during the reverse process. Specifically, we introduce an infrared thermal spectrum distribution regulation to preserve visual fidelity, ensuring that the reconstructed infrared images closely align with high-resolution images by matching their frequency components. Subsequently, we incorporate various visual foundational models as the perceptual guidance for downstream visual tasks, infusing generalizable perceptual features beneficial for detection and segmentation. As a result, our approach gains superior visual results while attaining State-Of-The-Art downstream task performance.

Current research exploring the vulnerabilities using adversarial patches often struggles to balance the trade-off between attack effectiveness and visual quality. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework of patch attack from semantic perspective, which we refer to as AdvLogo. Based on the hypothesis that every semantic space contains an adversarial subspace where images can cause detectors to fail in recognizing objects, we leverage the semantic understanding of the diffusion denoising process and drive the process to adversarial subareas by perturbing the latent and unconditional embeddings at the last timestep. To mitigate the distribution shift that exposes a negative impact on image quality, we apply perturbation to the latent in frequency domain with the Fourier Transform. Experimental results demonstrate that AdvLogo achieves strong attack performance while maintaining high visual quality.</p></details> |  |

While posterior sampling methods for continuous diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress, analogous methods for discrete diffusion models remain challenging. In this work, we introduce a principled plug-and-play discrete diffusion posterior sampling algorithm based on split Gibbs sampling, which we call SG-DPS. Our algorithm enables reward-guided generation and solving inverse problems in discrete-state spaces. We demonstrate that SG-DPS converges to the true posterior distribution on synthetic benchmarks, and enjoys state-of-the-art posterior sampling performance on a range of benchmarks for discrete data, achieving up to 2x improved performance compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning Timestep-Distilled Diffusion Model Using Pairwise Sample Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03190v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in timestep-distilled diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation that rivals non-distilled multi-step models, but with significantly fewer inference steps. While such models are attractive for applications due to the low inference cost and latency, fine-tuning them with a naive diffusion objective would result in degraded and blurry outputs. An intuitive alternative is to repeat the diffusion distillation process with a fine-tuned teacher model, which produces good results but is cumbersome and computationally intensive; the distillation training usually requires magnitude higher of training compute compared to fine-tuning for specific image styles. In this paper, we present an algorithm named pairwise sample optimization (PSO), which enables the direct fine-tuning of an arbitrary timestep-distilled diffusion model. PSO introduces additional reference images sampled from the current time-step distilled model, and increases the relative likelihood margin between the training images and reference images. This enables the model to retain its few-step generation ability, while allowing for fine-tuning of its output distribution. We also demonstrate that PSO is a generalized formulation which can be flexibly extended to both offline-sampled and online-sampled pairwise data, covering various popular objectives for diffusion model preference optimization. We evaluate PSO in both preference optimization and other fine-tuning tasks, including style transfer and concept customization. We show that PSO can directly adapt distilled models to human-preferred generation with both offline and online-generated pairwise preference image data. PSO also demonstrates effectiveness in style transfer and concept customization by directly tuning timestep-distilled diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

We first formulate the problem as a generic regularized loss minimization over probability distributions and directly optimize the distribution using the Dual Averaging method. Next, we enable sampling from the learned distribution by approximating its score function via Doob's $h$-transform technique. The proposed framework is supported by rigorous convergence guarantees and an end-to-end bound on the sampling error, which imply that when the original distribution's score is known accurately, the complexity of sampling from shifted distributions is independent of isoperimetric conditions. This framework is broadly applicable to general distribution optimization problems, including alignment tasks in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). We empirically validate its performance on synthetic and image datasets using the DPO objective.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoInD: Enabling Logical Compositions in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01145v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we learn generative models to sample data with arbitrary logical compositions of statistically independent attributes? The prevailing solution is to sample from distributions expressed as a composition of attributes' conditional marginal distributions under the assumption that they are statistically independent. This paper shows that standard conditional diffusion models violate this assumption, even when all attribute compositions are observed during training. And, this violation is significantly more severe when only a subset of the compositions is observed. We propose CoInD to address this problem. It explicitly enforces statistical independence between the conditional marginal distributions by minimizing Fisher's divergence between the joint and marginal distributions. The theoretical advantages of CoInD are reflected in both qualitative and quantitative experiments, demonstrating a significantly more faithful and controlled generation of samples for arbitrary logical compositions of attributes. The benefit is more pronounced for scenarios that current solutions relying on the assumption of conditionally independent marginals struggle with, namely, logical compositions involving the NOT operation and when only a subset of compositions are observed during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPR: Diffusion Preference-based Reward for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01143v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) mitigates the need for reward definition, aligning with human preferences via preference-driven reward feedback without interacting with the environment. However, the effectiveness of preference-driven reward functions depends on the modeling ability of the learning model, which current MLP-based and Transformer-based methods may fail to adequately provide. To alleviate the failure of the reward function caused by insufficient modeling, we propose a novel preference-based reward acquisition method: Diffusion Preference-based Reward (DPR). Unlike previous methods using Bradley-Terry models for trajectory preferences, we use diffusion models to directly model preference distributions for state-action pairs, allowing rewards to be discriminatively obtained from these distributions. In addition, considering the particularity of preference data that only know the internal relationships of paired trajectories, we further propose Conditional Diffusion Preference-based Reward (C-DPR), which leverages relative preference information to enhance the construction of the diffusion model. We apply the above methods to existing offline reinforcement learning algorithms and a series of experiment results demonstrate that the diffusion-based reward acquisition approach outperforms previous MLP-based and Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Learn Weight Generation via Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01117v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation, particularly in scenarios like multi-task learning that require frequent weight updates. However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Lt-Di-0E51.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a feature learning framework aimed at analyzing and comparing the training dynamics of diffusion models with those of traditional classification models. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that diffusion models, due to the denoising objective, are encouraged to learn more balanced and comprehensive representations of the data. In contrast, neural networks with a similar architecture trained for classification tend to prioritize learning specific patterns in the data, often focusing on easy-to-learn components. To support these theoretical insights, we conduct several experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which empirically validate our findings and highlight the distinct feature learning dynamics in diffusion models compared to classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Drift, Diffusion, and Causal Structure from Temporal Snapshots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22729v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a fundamental tool for modelling dynamic processes, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), contaminant transport, financial markets, and image generation. However, learning the underlying SDE from data is a challenging task, especially if individual trajectories are not observable. Motivated by burgeoning research in single-cell datasets, we present the first comprehensive approach for jointly identifying the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its temporal marginals. Assuming linear drift and additive diffusion, we prove that these parameters are identifiable from marginals if and only if the initial distribution lacks any generalized rotational symmetries. We further prove that the causal graph of any SDE with additive diffusion can be recovered from the SDE parameters. To complement this theory, we adapt entropy-regularized optimal transport to handle anisotropic diffusion, and introduce APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from $X_0$), an iterative algorithm designed to estimate the drift, diffusion, and causal graph of an additive noise SDE, solely from temporal marginals. We show that APPEX iteratively decreases Kullback-Leibler divergence to the true solution, and demonstrate its effectiveness on simulated data from linear additive noise SDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Unlearning in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01034v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that diffusion models memorize and reproduce training data examples. At the same time, large copyright lawsuits and legislation such as GDPR have highlighted the need for erasing datapoints from diffusion models. However, retraining from scratch is often too expensive. This motivates the setting of data unlearning, i.e., the study of efficient techniques for unlearning specific datapoints from the training set. Existing concept unlearning techniques require an anchor prompt/class/distribution to guide unlearning, which is not available in the data unlearning setting. General-purpose machine unlearning techniques were found to be either unstable or failed to unlearn data. We therefore propose a family of new loss functions called Subtracted Importance Sampled Scores (SISS) that utilize importance sampling and are the first method to unlearn data with theoretical guarantees. SISS is constructed as a weighted combination between simpler objectives that are responsible for preserving model quality and unlearning the targeted datapoints. When evaluated on CelebA-HQ and MNIST, SISS achieved Pareto optimality along the quality and unlearning strength dimensions. On Stable Diffusion, SISS successfully mitigated memorization on nearly 90% of the prompts we tested.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

It includes existing diffusion models for generative modeling, but also underdamped versions with degenerate diffusion matrices, where the noise only acts in certain dimensions. Extending previous findings, our framework allows to rigorously show that score matching in the underdamped case is indeed equivalent to maximizing a lower bound on the likelihood. Motivated by superior convergence properties and compatibility with sophisticated numerical integration schemes of underdamped stochastic processes, we propose \emph{underdamped diffusion bridges}, where a general density evolution is learned rather than prescribed by a fixed noising process. We apply our method to the challenging task of sampling from unnormalized densities without access to samples from the target distribution. Across a diverse range of sampling problems, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, notably outperforming alternative methods, while requiring significantly fewer discretization steps and no hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in atom- and motif-wise deep learning models for 3D molecular generation, current methods often struggle with validity and reliability. To address these issues, we develop the Atom-Motif Consistency Diffusion Model (AMDiff), utilizing a joint-training paradigm for multi-view learning. This model features a hierarchical diffusion architecture that integrates both atom- and motif-level views of molecules, allowing for comprehensive exploration of complementary information. By leveraging classifier-free guidance and incorporating binding site features as conditional inputs, AMDiff ensures robust molecule generation across diverse targets. Compared to existing approaches, AMDiff exhibits superior validity and novelty in generating molecules tailored to fit various protein pockets. Case studies targeting protein kinases, including Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), demonstrate the model's capability in structure-based de novo drug design. Overall, AMDiff bridges the gap between atom-view and motif-view drug discovery and speeds up the process of target-aware molecular generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

SymDiff resembles a learned data augmentation that is deployed at sampling time, and is lightweight, computationally efficient, and easy to implement on top of arbitrary off-the-shelf models. In contrast to previous work, SymDiff typically does not require any neural network components that are intrinsically equivariant, avoiding the need for complex parameterisations or the use of higher-order geometric features. Instead, our method can leverage highly scalable modern architectures as drop-in replacements for these more constrained alternatives. We show that this additional flexibility yields significant empirical benefit for $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariant molecular generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of symmetrisation to generative modelling, suggesting its potential in this domain more generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[FedBiP: Heterogeneous One-Shot Federated Learning with Personalized Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04810v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL), a special decentralized machine learning paradigm, has recently gained significant attention. OSFL requires only a single round of client data or model upload, which reduces communication costs and mitigates privacy threats compared to traditional FL. Despite these promising prospects, existing methods face challenges due to client data heterogeneity and limited data quantity when applied to real-world OSFL systems. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) have shown remarkable advancements in synthesizing high-quality images through pretraining on large-scale datasets, thereby presenting a potential solution to overcome these issues. However, directly applying pretrained LDM to heterogeneous OSFL results in significant distribution shifts in synthetic data, leading to performance degradation in classification models trained on such data. This issue is particularly pronounced in rare domains, such as medical imaging, which are underrepresented in LDM's pretraining data. To address this challenge, we propose Federated Bi-Level Personalization (FedBiP), which personalizes the pretrained LDM at both instance-level and concept-level. Hereby, FedBiP synthesizes images following the client's local data distribution without compromising the privacy regulations. FedBiP is also the first approach to simultaneously address feature space heterogeneity and client data scarcity in OSFL. Our method is validated through extensive experiments on three OSFL benchmarks with feature space heterogeneity, as well as on challenging medical and satellite image datasets with label heterogeneity. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedBiP, which substantially outperforms other OSFL methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

| **[Dynamical Diffusion: Learning Temporal Dynamics with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00951v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks by progressively adding noise to data through a forward process and then reversing this process to generate realistic samples. While these models have achieved strong performance across various tasks and modalities, their application to temporal predictive learning remains underexplored. Existing approaches treat predictive learning as a conditional generation problem, but often fail to fully exploit the temporal dynamics inherent in the data, leading to challenges in generating temporally coherent sequences. To address this, we introduce Dynamical Diffusion (DyDiff), a theoretically sound framework that incorporates temporally aware forward and reverse processes. Dynamical Diffusion explicitly models temporal transitions at each diffusion step, establishing dependencies on preceding states to better capture temporal dynamics. Through the reparameterization trick, Dynamical Diffusion achieves efficient training and inference similar to any standard diffusion model. Extensive experiments across scientific spatiotemporal forecasting, video prediction, and time series forecasting demonstrate that Dynamical Diffusion consistently improves performance in temporal predictive tasks, filling a crucial gap in existing methodologies.

| **[A Dual-Purpose Framework for Backdoor Defense and Backdoor Amplification in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19047v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative frameworks, excelling in producing high-quality multi-modal samples. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where backdoored models generate specific, undesirable outputs called backdoor target (e.g., harmful images) when a pre-defined trigger is embedded to their inputs. In this paper, we propose PureDiffusion, a dual-purpose framework that simultaneously serves two contrasting roles: backdoor defense and backdoor attack amplification. For defense, we introduce two novel loss functions to invert backdoor triggers embedded in diffusion models. The first leverages trigger-induced distribution shifts across multiple timesteps of the diffusion process, while the second exploits the denoising consistency effect when a backdoor is activated. Once an accurate trigger inversion is achieved, we develop a backdoor detection method that analyzes both the inverted trigger and the generated backdoor targets to identify backdoor attacks. In terms of attack amplification with the role of an attacker, we describe how our trigger inversion algorithm can be used to reinforce the original trigger embedded in the backdoored diffusion model. This significantly boosts attack performance while reducing the required backdoor training time. Experimental results demonstrate that PureDiffusion achieves near-perfect detection accuracy, outperforming existing defenses by a large margin, particularly against complex trigger patterns. Additionally, in an attack scenario, our attack amplification approach elevates the attack success rate (ASR) of existing backdoor attacks to nearly 100\% while reducing training time by up to 20x.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Multi-user Offloading of Personalized Diffusion Models: A DRL-Convex Hybrid Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15781v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models, personalized content synthesis has emerged as the most highly anticipated. However, the large model sizes and iterative nature of inference make it difficult to deploy personalized diffusion models broadly on local devices with varying computational power. To this end, we propose a novel framework for efficient multi-user offloading of personalized diffusion models, given a variable number of users, diverse user computational capabilities, and fluctuating available computational resources on the edge server. To enhance computational efficiency and reduce storage burden on edge servers, we first propose a tailored multi-user hybrid inference manner, where the inference process for each user is split into two phases with an optimizable split point. The initial phase of inference is processed on a cluster-wide model using batching techniques, generating low-level semantic information corresponding to each user's prompt. Then, the users employ their own personalized model to add further details in the later inference phase. Given the constraints on edge server computational resources and users' preferences for low latency and high accuracy, we model the joint optimization of each user's offloading request handling and split point as an extension of the Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP). Our objective is to maximize a comprehensive metric that accounts for both latency and accuracy across all users. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we transform the GQAP into an adaptive decision sequence, model it as a Markov decision process, and develop a hybrid solution combining deep reinforcement learning with convex optimization techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior optimality and low complexity compared to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

The zero-shot generation of various visual content using a pretrained image diffusion model has been explored mainly in two directions. First, Diffusion Synchronization-performing reverse diffusion processes jointly across different projected spaces while synchronizing them in the target space-generates high-quality outputs when enough conditioning is provided, but it struggles in its absence. Second, Score Distillation Sampling-gradually updating the target space data through gradient descent-results in better coherence but often lacks detail. In this paper, we reveal for the first time the interconnection between these two methods while highlighting their differences. To this end, we propose StochSync, a novel approach that combines the strengths of both, enabling effective performance with weak conditioning. Our experiments demonstrate that StochSync provides the best performance in 360{\deg} panorama generation (where image conditioning is not given), outperforming previous finetuning-based methods, and also delivers comparable results in 3D mesh texturing (where depth conditioning is provided) with previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://stochsync.github.io/ (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[On the Asymptotic Mean Square Error Optimality of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02957v4)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) as generative priors have recently shown great potential for denoising tasks but lack theoretical understanding with respect to their mean square error (MSE) optimality. This paper proposes a novel denoising strategy inspired by the structure of the MSE-optimal conditional mean estimator (CME). The resulting DM-based denoiser can be conveniently employed using a pre-trained DM, being particularly fast by truncating reverse diffusion steps and not requiring stochastic re-sampling. We present a comprehensive (non-)asymptotic optimality analysis of the proposed diffusion-based denoiser, demonstrating polynomial-time convergence to the CME under mild conditions. Our analysis also derives a novel Lipschitz constant that depends solely on the DM's hyperparameters. Further, we offer a new perspective on DMs, showing that they inherently combine an asymptotically optimal denoiser with a powerful generator, modifiable by switching re-sampling in the reverse process on or off. The theoretical findings are thoroughly validated with experiments based on various benchmark datasets</p></details> |  |
| **[DartControl: A Diffusion-Based Autoregressive Motion Model for Real-Time Text-Driven Motion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05260v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-conditioned human motion generation, which allows for user interaction through natural language, has become increasingly popular. Existing methods typically generate short, isolated motions based on a single input sentence. However, human motions are continuous and can extend over long periods, carrying rich semantics. Creating long, complex motions that precisely respond to streams of text descriptions, particularly in an online and real-time setting, remains a significant challenge. Furthermore, incorporating spatial constraints into text-conditioned motion generation presents additional challenges, as it requires aligning the motion semantics specified by text descriptions with geometric information, such as goal locations and 3D scene geometry. To address these limitations, we propose DartControl, in short DART, a Diffusion-based Autoregressive motion primitive model for Real-time Text-driven motion control. Our model effectively learns a compact motion primitive space jointly conditioned on motion history and text inputs using latent diffusion models. By autoregressively generating motion primitives based on the preceding history and current text input, DART enables real-time, sequential motion generation driven by natural language descriptions. Additionally, the learned motion primitive space allows for precise spatial motion control, which we formulate either as a latent noise optimization problem or as a Markov decision process addressed through reinforcement learning. We present effective algorithms for both approaches, demonstrating our model's versatility and superior performance in various motion synthesis tasks. Experiments show our method outperforms existing baselines in motion realism, efficiency, and controllability.

However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

However, the error analysis for discrete diffusion models remains less well-understood. In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework for the error analysis of discrete diffusion models based on L\'evy-type stochastic integrals. By generalizing the Poisson random measure to that with a time-independent and state-dependent intensity, we rigorously establish a stochastic integral formulation of discrete diffusion models and provide the corresponding change of measure theorems that are intriguingly analogous to It\^o integrals and Girsanov's theorem for their continuous counterparts. Our framework unifies and strengthens the current theoretical results on discrete diffusion models and obtains the first error bound for the $\tau$-leaping scheme in KL divergence. With error sources clearly identified, our analysis gives new insight into the mathematical properties of discrete diffusion models and offers guidance for the design of efficient and accurate algorithms for real-world discrete diffusion model applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving Long-Text Alignment for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11817v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has enabled them to generate unprecedented results from given texts. However, as text inputs become longer, existing encoding methods like CLIP face limitations, and aligning the generated images with long texts becomes challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose LongAlign, which includes a segment-level encoding method for processing long texts and a decomposed preference optimization method for effective alignment training. For segment-level encoding, long texts are divided into multiple segments and processed separately. This method overcomes the maximum input length limits of pretrained encoding models. For preference optimization, we provide decomposed CLIP-based preference models to fine-tune diffusion models. Specifically, to utilize CLIP-based preference models for T2I alignment, we delve into their scoring mechanisms and find that the preference scores can be decomposed into two components: a text-relevant part that measures T2I alignment and a text-irrelevant part that assesses other visual aspects of human preference. Additionally, we find that the text-irrelevant part contributes to a common overfitting problem during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose a reweighting strategy that assigns different weights to these two components, thereby reducing overfitting and enhancing alignment. After fine-tuning $512 \times 512$ Stable Diffusion (SD) v1.5 for about 20 hours using our method, the fine-tuned SD outperforms stronger foundation models in T2I alignment, such as PixArt-$\alpha$ and Kandinsky v2.2.

| **[Geodesic Diffusion Models for Medical Image-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00745v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models transform an unknown data distribution into a Gaussian prior by progressively adding noise until the data become indistinguishable from pure noise. This stochastic process traces a path in probability space, evolving from the original data distribution (considered as a Gaussian with near-zero variance) to an isotropic Gaussian. The denoiser then learns to reverse this process, generating high-quality samples from random Gaussian noise. However, standard diffusion models, such as the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), do not ensure a geodesic (i.e., shortest) path in probability space. This inefficiency necessitates the use of many intermediate time steps, leading to high computational costs in training and sampling. To address this limitation, we propose the Geodesic Diffusion Model (GDM), which defines a geodesic path under the Fisher-Rao metric with a variance-exploding noise scheduler. This formulation transforms the data distribution into a Gaussian prior with minimal energy, significantly improving the efficiency of diffusion models. We trained GDM by continuously sampling time steps from 0 to 1 and using as few as 15 evenly spaced time steps for model sampling. We evaluated GDM on two medical image-to-image generation tasks: CT image denoising and MRI image super-resolution. Experimental results show that GDM achieved state-of-the-art performance while reducing training time by a 50-fold compared to DDPM and 10-fold compared to Fast-DDPM, with 66 times faster sampling than DDPM and a similar sampling speed to Fast-DDPM. These efficiency gains enable rapid model exploration and real-time clinical applications. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/GDM-VE.</p></details> |  |

We posit machine unlearning (MU) as a crucial foundation for developing safe, secure, and trustworthy GenAI models. Traditional MU methods often rely on stringent assumptions and require access to real data. This paper introduces Score Forgetting Distillation (SFD), an innovative MU approach that promotes the forgetting of undesirable information in diffusion models by aligning the conditional scores of "unsafe" classes or concepts with those of "safe" ones. To eliminate the need for real data, our SFD framework incorporates a score-based MU loss into the score distillation objective of a pretrained diffusion model. This serves as a regularization term that preserves desired generation capabilities while enabling the production of synthetic data through a one-step generator. Our experiments on pretrained label-conditional and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method effectively accelerates the forgetting of target classes or concepts during generation, while preserving the quality of other classes or concepts. This unlearned and distilled diffusion not only pioneers a novel concept in MU but also accelerates the generation speed of diffusion models. Our experiments and studies on a range of diffusion models and datasets confirm that our approach is generalizable, effective, and advantageous for MU in diffusion models.

For those systems without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, commencing with the representation of state-action mapping in the end-to-end autonomous driving paradigm, we introduce a novel pipeline, VDT-Auto. Leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of Visual Language Model (VLM), incorporating with diffusion Transformer-based action generation, our VDT-Auto parses the environment geometrically and contextually for the conditioning of the diffusion process. Geometrically, we use a bird's-eye view (BEV) encoder to extract feature grids from the surrounding images. Contextually, the structured output of our fine-tuned VLM is processed into textual embeddings and noisy paths. During our diffusion process, the added noise for the forward process is sampled from the noisy path output of the fine-tuned VLM, while the extracted BEV feature grids and embedded texts condition the reverse process of our diffusion Transformers. Our VDT-Auto achieved 0.52m on average L2 errors and 21% on average collision rate in the nuScenes open-loop planning evaluation. Moreover, the real-world demonstration exhibited prominent generalizability of our VDT-Auto. The code and dataset will be released after acceptance.</p></details> | Submitted paper |

Recently, Diffusion Models have revolutionized the capabilities of generative methods by surpassing the performance of GANs. In this work, we present FitDiff, a diffusion-based 3D facial avatar generative model. Leveraging diffusion principles, our model accurately generates relightable facial avatars, utilizing an identity embedding extracted from an "in-the-wild" 2D facial image. The introduced multi-modal diffusion model is the first to concurrently output facial reflectance maps (diffuse and specular albedo and normals) and shapes, showcasing great generalization capabilities. It is solely trained on an annotated subset of a public facial dataset, paired with 3D reconstructions. We revisit the typical 3D facial fitting approach by guiding a reverse diffusion process using perceptual and face recognition losses. Being the first 3D LDM conditioned on face recognition embeddings, FitDiff reconstructs relightable human avatars, that can be used as-is in common rendering engines, starting only from an unconstrained facial image, and achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

However, in recent years, diffusion models have emerged as a non-adversarial alternative to GANs that merely require training a score function via regression, yet produce generations of higher quality. In response, we investigate how to lift insights from diffusion modeling to the sequential setting. We propose diffusing states and performing score-matching along diffused states to measure the discrepancy between the expert's and learner's states. Thus, our approach only requires training score functions to predict noises via standard regression, making it significantly easier and more stable to train than adversarial methods. Theoretically, we prove first- and second-order instance-dependent bounds with linear scaling in the horizon, proving that our approach avoids the compounding errors that stymie offline approaches to imitation learning. Empirically, we show our approach outperforms both GAN-style imitation learning baselines and discriminator-free imitation learning baselines across various continuous control problems, including complex tasks like controlling humanoids to walk, sit, crawl, and navigate through obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

While numerous studies have demonstrated the impressive performance of diffusion planning, the mechanisms behind the key components of a good diffusion planner remain unclear and the design choices are highly inconsistent in existing studies. In this work, we address this issue through systematic empirical experiments on diffusion planning in an offline reinforcement learning (RL) setting, providing practical insights into the essential components of diffusion planning. We trained and evaluated over 6,000 diffusion models, identifying the critical components such as guided sampling, network architecture, action generation and planning strategy. We revealed that some design choices opposite to the common practice in previous work in diffusion planning actually lead to better performance, e.g., unconditional sampling with selection can be better than guided sampling and Transformer outperforms U-Net as denoising network. Based on these insights, we suggest a simple yet strong diffusion planning baseline that achieves state-of-the-art results on standard offline RL benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 (Spotlight), Code: https://github.com/Josh00-Lu/DiffusionVeteran</p></details> |
