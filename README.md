| **[MusicInfuser: Making Video Diffusion Listen and Dance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14505v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MusicInfuser, an approach for generating high-quality dance videos that are synchronized to a specified music track. Rather than attempting to design and train a new multimodal audio-video model, we show how existing video diffusion models can be adapted to align with musical inputs by introducing lightweight music-video cross-attention and a low-rank adapter. Unlike prior work requiring motion capture data, our approach fine-tunes only on dance videos. MusicInfuser achieves high-quality music-driven video generation while preserving the flexibility and generative capabilities of the underlying models. We introduce an evaluation framework using Video-LLMs to assess multiple dimensions of dance generation quality.

| **[MagicComp: Training-free Dual-Phase Refinement for Compositional Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14428v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) generation has made significant strides with diffusion models. However, existing methods still struggle with accurately binding attributes, determining spatial relationships, and capturing complex action interactions between multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we propose MagicComp, a training-free method that enhances compositional T2V generation through dual-phase refinement. Specifically, (1) During the Conditioning Stage: We introduce the Semantic Anchor Disambiguation to reinforces subject-specific semantics and resolve inter-subject ambiguity by progressively injecting the directional vectors of semantic anchors into original text embedding; (2) During the Denoising Stage: We propose Dynamic Layout Fusion Attention, which integrates grounding priors and model-adaptive spatial perception to flexibly bind subjects to their spatiotemporal regions through masked attention modulation. Furthermore, MagicComp is a model-agnostic and versatile approach, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing T2V architectures. Extensive experiments on T2V-CompBench and VBench demonstrate that MagicComp outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential for applications such as complex prompt-based and trajectory-controllable video generation.

| **[Impossible Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14378v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic videos nowadays is widely used to complement data scarcity and diversity of real-world videos. Current synthetic datasets primarily replicate real-world scenarios, leaving impossible, counterfactual and anti-reality video concepts underexplored. This work aims to answer two questions: 1) Can today's video generation models effectively follow prompts to create impossible video content? 2) Are today's video understanding models good enough for understanding impossible videos? To this end, we introduce IPV-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate and foster progress in video understanding and generation. IPV-Bench is underpinned by a comprehensive taxonomy, encompassing 4 domains, 14 categories. It features diverse scenes that defy physical, biological, geographical, or social laws. Based on the taxonomy, a prompt suite is constructed to evaluate video generation models, challenging their prompt following and creativity capabilities. In addition, a video benchmark is curated to assess Video-LLMs on their ability of understanding impossible videos, which particularly requires reasoning on temporal dynamics and world knowledge. Comprehensive evaluations reveal limitations and insights for future directions of video models, paving the way for next-generation video models.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[DreamRunner: Fine-Grained Compositional Story-to-Video Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Motion Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16657v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Storytelling video generation (SVG) aims to produce coherent and visually rich multi-scene videos that follow a structured narrative. Existing methods primarily employ LLM for high-level planning to decompose a story into scene-level descriptions, which are then independently generated and stitched together. However, these approaches struggle with generating high-quality videos aligned with the complex single-scene description, as visualizing such complex description involves coherent composition of multiple characters and events, complex motion synthesis and muti-character customization. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next, DreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame semantic control. We compare DreamRunner with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DreamRunner exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DreamRunner's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://zunwang1.github.io/DreamRunner</p></details> |
| **[LeanVAE: An Ultra-Efficient Reconstruction VAE for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14325v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) have revolutionized video generation by leveraging Video Variational Autoencoders (Video VAEs) to compress intricate video data into a compact latent space. However, as LVDM training scales, the computational overhead of Video VAEs becomes a critical bottleneck, particularly for encoding high-resolution videos. To address this, we propose LeanVAE, a novel and ultra-efficient Video VAE framework that introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight architecture based on a Neighborhood-Aware Feedforward (NAF) module and non-overlapping patch operations, drastically reducing computational cost, and (2) the integration of wavelet transforms and compressed sensing techniques to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments validate LeanVAE's superiority in video reconstruction and generation, particularly in enhancing efficiency over existing Video VAEs. Our model offers up to 50x fewer FLOPs and 44x faster inference speed while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, providing insights for scalable, efficient video generation. Our models and code are available at https://github.com/westlake-repl/LeanVAE</p></details> |  |
| **[Concat-ID: Towards Universal Identity-Preserving Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14151v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Concat-ID, a unified framework for identity-preserving video generation. Concat-ID employs Variational Autoencoders to extract image features, which are concatenated with video latents along the sequence dimension, leveraging solely 3D self-attention mechanisms without the need for additional modules. A novel cross-video pairing strategy and a multi-stage training regimen are introduced to balance identity consistency and facial editability while enhancing video naturalness. Extensive experiments demonstrate Concat-ID's superiority over existing methods in both single and multi-identity generation, as well as its seamless scalability to multi-subject scenarios, including virtual try-on and background-controllable generation. Concat-ID establishes a new benchmark for identity-preserving video synthesis, providing a versatile and scalable solution for a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Generation: Unlocking Universal Editing via Self-Supervised Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02114v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation have outpaced progress in video editing, which remains constrained by several limiting factors, namely: (a) the task's dependency on supervision severely limits generality, (b) an unnecessary artificial separation between the generation and editing task, and (c) the high computational costs of training a video model. In this work, we propose UES (Unlocking Universal Editing via Self-Supervision), a lightweight self-supervised fine-tuning strategy that transforms generation models into unified generation-editing systems through self-supervised semantic alignment. Our approach establishes a dual-conditioning mechanism where original video-text pairs jointly provide visual and textual semantics, enabling structured learning of intrinsic spatiotemporal correspondences. Key advantages include: (i) Universality through supervision-free adaptation to diverse editing tasks, (ii) Unification of generation and editing applicable to most text(+image)-to-video model, and (iii) Efficiency via lightweight fine-tune that reduces tunable parameters by 92.67%. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce OmniBench-99, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 99 videos across humans/animals, environments, and objects, comprising 4 editing types and 8 scenarios. Extensive experiments show UES enables models without inherent editing capability to perform powerful and universal editing while preserving or even enhancing their original generation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://haroldchen19.github.io/UES-Page/</p></details> |
| **[Fast Autoregressive Video Generation with Diagonal Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14070v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive Transformer models have demonstrated impressive performance in video generation, but their sequential token-by-token decoding process poses a major bottleneck, particularly for long videos represented by tens of thousands of tokens. In this paper, we propose Diagonal Decoding (DiagD), a training-free inference acceleration algorithm for autoregressively pre-trained models that exploits spatial and temporal correlations in videos. Our method generates tokens along diagonal paths in the spatial-temporal token grid, enabling parallel decoding within each frame as well as partially overlapping across consecutive frames. The proposed algorithm is versatile and adaptive to various generative models and tasks, while providing flexible control over the trade-off between inference speed and visual quality. Furthermore, we propose a cost-effective finetuning strategy that aligns the attention patterns of the model with our decoding order, further mitigating the training-inference gap on small-scale models. Experiments on multiple autoregressive video generation models and datasets demonstrate that DiagD achieves up to $10\times$ speedup compared to naive sequential decoding, while maintaining comparable visual fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[AIGVE-Tool: AI-Generated Video Evaluation Toolkit with Multifaceted Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14064v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement in AI-generated video synthesis has led to a growth demand for standardized and effective evaluation metrics. Existing metrics lack a unified framework for systematically categorizing methodologies, limiting a holistic understanding of the evaluation landscape. Additionally, fragmented implementations and the absence of standardized interfaces lead to redundant processing overhead. Furthermore, many prior approaches are constrained by dataset-specific dependencies, limiting their applicability across diverse video domains. To address these challenges, we introduce AIGVE-Tool (AI-Generated Video Evaluation Toolkit), a unified framework that provides a structured and extensible evaluation pipeline for a comprehensive AI-generated video evaluation. Organized within a novel five-category taxonomy, AIGVE-Tool integrates multiple evaluation methodologies while allowing flexible customization through a modular configuration system. Additionally, we propose AIGVE-Bench, a large-scale benchmark dataset created with five SOTA video generation models based on hand-crafted instructions and prompts. This dataset systematically evaluates various video generation models across nine critical quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AIGVE-Tool in providing standardized and reliable evaluation results, highlighting specific strengths and limitations of current models and facilitating the advancements of next-generation AI-generated video techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity-Preserving Pose-Guided Character Animation via Facial Landmarks Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08976v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating realistic pose-guided image-to-video character animations while preserving facial identity remains challenging, especially in complex and dynamic scenarios such as dancing, where precise identity consistency is crucial. Existing methods frequently encounter difficulties maintaining facial coherence due to misalignments between facial landmarks extracted from driving videos that provide head pose and expression cues and the facial geometry of the reference images. To address this limitation, we introduce the Facial Landmarks Transformation (FLT) method, which leverages a 3D Morphable Model to address this limitation. FLT converts 2D landmarks into a 3D face model, adjusts the 3D face model to align with the reference identity, and then transforms them back into 2D landmarks to guide the image-to-video generation process. This approach ensures accurate alignment with the reference facial geometry, enhancing the consistency between generated videos and reference images. Experimental results demonstrate that FLT effectively preserves facial identity, significantly improving pose-guided character animation models.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Timestep Embedding Tells: It's Time to Cache for Video Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19108v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising. Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025.

| **[Reangle-A-Video: 4D Video Generation as Video-to-Video Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09151v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized multi-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data.

| **[Frame-wise Conditioning Adaptation for Fine-Tuning Diffusion Models in Text-to-Video Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12953v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-video prediction (TVP) is a downstream video generation task that requires a model to produce subsequent video frames given a series of initial video frames and text describing the required motion. In practice TVP methods focus on a particular category of videos depicting manipulations of objects carried out by human beings or robot arms. Previous methods adapt models pre-trained on text-to-image tasks, and thus tend to generate video that lacks the required continuity. A natural progression would be to leverage more recent pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) models. This approach is rendered more challenging by the fact that the most common fine-tuning technique, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), yields undesirable results. In this work, we propose an adaptation-based strategy we label Frame-wise Conditioning Adaptation (FCA). Within the module, we devise a sub-module that produces frame-wise text embeddings from the input text, which acts as an additional text condition to aid generation. We use FCA to fine-tune the T2V model, which incorporates the initial frame(s) as an extra condition. We compare and discuss the more effective strategy for injecting such embeddings into the T2V model. We conduct extensive ablation studies on our design choices with quantitative and qualitative performance analysis. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art for the task of TVP.

| **[Other Vehicle Trajectories Are Also Needed: A Driving World Model Unifies Ego-Other Vehicle Trajectories in Video Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09215v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving World Model named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[AUTV: Creating Underwater Video Datasets with Pixel-wise Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12828v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater video analysis, hampered by the dynamic marine environment and camera motion, remains a challenging task in computer vision. Existing training-free video generation techniques, learning motion dynamics on the frame-by-frame basis, often produce poor results with noticeable motion interruptions and misaligments. To address these issues, we propose AUTV, a framework for synthesizing marine video data with pixel-wise annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by constructing two video datasets, namely UTV, a real-world dataset comprising 2,000 video-text pairs, and SUTV, a synthetic video dataset including 10,000 videos with segmentation masks for marine objects. UTV provides diverse underwater videos with comprehensive annotations including appearance, texture, camera intrinsics, lighting, and animal behavior. SUTV can be used to improve underwater downstream tasks, which are demonstrated in video inpainting and video object segmentation.</p></details> | under review |
| **[A Survey of State of the Art Large Vision Language Models: Alignment, Benchmark, Evaluations and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02189v5)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a transformative technology at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, enabling machines to perceive and reason about the world through both visual and textual modalities. For example, models such as CLIP, Claude, and GPT-4V demonstrate strong reasoning and understanding abilities on visual and textual data and beat classical single modality vision models on zero-shot classification. Despite their rapid advancements in research and growing popularity in applications, a comprehensive survey of existing studies on VLMs is notably lacking, particularly for researchers aiming to leverage VLMs in their specific domains. To this end, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs in the following aspects: model information of the major VLMs developed over the past five years (2019-2024); the main architectures and training methods of these VLMs; summary and categorization of the popular benchmarks and evaluation metrics of VLMs; the applications of VLMs including embodied agents, robotics, and video generation; the challenges and issues faced by current VLMs such as hallucination, fairness, and safety.

The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method has strong capabilities to address video super-resolution challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |
| **[SPC-GS: Gaussian Splatting with Semantic-Prompt Consistency for Indoor Open-World Free-view Synthesis from Sparse Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12535v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting-based indoor open-world free-view synthesis approaches have shown significant performance with dense input images. However, they exhibit poor performance when confronted with sparse inputs, primarily due to the sparse distribution of Gaussian points and insufficient view supervision. To relieve these challenges, we propose SPC-GS, leveraging Scene-layout-based Gaussian Initialization (SGI) and Semantic-Prompt Consistency (SPC) Regularization for open-world free view synthesis with sparse inputs. Specifically, SGI provides a dense, scene-layout-based Gaussian distribution by utilizing view-changed images generated from the video generation model and view-constraint Gaussian points densification. Additionally, SPC mitigates limited view supervision by employing semantic-prompt-based consistency constraints developed by SAM2. This approach leverages available semantics from training views, serving as instructive prompts, to optimize visually overlapping regions in novel views with 2D and 3D consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SPC-GS across Replica and ScanNet benchmarks. Notably, our SPC-GS achieves a 3.06 dB gain in PSNR for reconstruction quality and a 7.3% improvement in mIoU for open-world semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025.

| **[VMBench: A Benchmark for Perception-Aligned Video Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10076v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has advanced rapidly, improving evaluation methods, yet assessing video's motion remains a major challenge. Specifically, there are two key issues: 1) current motion metrics do not fully align with human perceptions; 2) the existing motion prompts are limited. Based on these findings, we introduce VMBench--a comprehensive Video Motion Benchmark that has perception-aligned motion metrics and features the most diverse types of motion. VMBench has several appealing properties: 1) Perception-Driven Motion Evaluation Metrics, we identify five dimensions based on human perception in motion video assessment and develop fine-grained evaluation metrics, providing deeper insights into models' strengths and weaknesses in motion quality. 2) Meta-Guided Motion Prompt Generation, a structured method that extracts meta-information, generates diverse motion prompts with LLMs, and refines them through human-AI validation, resulting in a multi-level prompt library covering six key dynamic scene dimensions. 3) Human-Aligned Validation Mechanism, we provide human preference annotations to validate our benchmarks, with our metrics achieving an average 35.3% improvement in Spearman's correlation over baseline methods. This is the first time that the quality of motion in videos has been evaluated from the perspective of human perception alignment. Additionally, we will soon release VMBench at https://github.com/GD-AIGC/VMBench, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing motion generation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PersonalVideo: High ID-Fidelity Video Customization without Dynamic and Semantic Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17048v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current text-to-video (T2V) generation has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic general videos, but it is still under-explored in identity-specific human video generation with customized ID images. The key challenge lies in maintaining high ID fidelity consistently while preserving the original motion dynamic and semantic following after the identity injection. Current video identity customization methods mainly rely on reconstructing given identity images on text-to-image models, which have a divergent distribution with the T2V model. This process introduces a tuning-inference gap, leading to dynamic and semantic degradation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework, dubbed $\textbf{PersonalVideo}$, that applies a mixture of reward supervision on synthesized videos instead of the simple reconstruction objective on images. Specifically, we first incorporate identity consistency reward to effectively inject the reference's identity without the tuning-inference gap. Then we propose a novel semantic consistency reward to align the semantic distribution of the generated videos with the original T2V model, which preserves its dynamic and semantic following capability during the identity injection. With the non-reconstructive reward training, we further employ simulated prompt augmentation to reduce overfitting by supervising generated results in more semantic scenarios, gaining good robustness even with only a single reference image. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in delivering high identity faithfulness while preserving the inherent video generation qualities of the original T2V model, outshining prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pyramidal Flow Matching for Efficient Video Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05954v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation requires modeling a vast spatiotemporal space, which demands significant computational resources and data usage. To reduce the complexity, the prevailing approaches employ a cascaded architecture to avoid direct training with full resolution latent. Despite reducing computational demands, the separate optimization of each sub-stage hinders knowledge sharing and sacrifices flexibility. This work introduces a unified pyramidal flow matching algorithm. It reinterprets the original denoising trajectory as a series of pyramid stages, where only the final stage operates at the full resolution, thereby enabling more efficient video generative modeling. Through our sophisticated design, the flows of different pyramid stages can be interlinked to maintain continuity. Moreover, we craft autoregressive video generation with a temporal pyramid to compress the full-resolution history. The entire framework can be optimized in an end-to-end manner and with a single unified Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method supports generating high-quality 5-second (up to 10-second) videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS within 20.7k A100 GPU training hours. All code and models are open-sourced at https://pyramid-flow.github.io.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Toward this goal, we introduce an audio-to-video generation framework for creating Real Time/cine-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (RT-/cine-MRI) visuals of the vocal tract from speech signals. Our framework first preprocesses RT-/cine-MRI sequences and speech samples to achieve temporal alignment, ensuring synchronization between visual and audio data. We then employ a modified stable diffusion model, integrating structural and temporal blocks, to effectively capture movement characteristics and temporal dynamics in the synchronized data. This process enables the generation of MRI sequences from new speech inputs, improving the conversion of audio into visual data. We evaluated our framework on healthy controls and tongue cancer patients by analyzing and comparing the vocal tract movements in synthesized videos. Our framework demonstrated adaptability to new speech inputs and effective generalization. In addition, positive human evaluations confirmed its effectiveness, with realistic and accurate visualizations, suggesting its potential for outpatient therapy and personalized simulation of vocal tract visualizations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods improve the alignment separately at each stage, making it difficult to manage subtle misalignments arising from another stage. Here, we present SteerX, a zero-shot inference-time steering method that unifies scene reconstruction into the generation process, tilting data distributions toward better geometric alignment. To this end, we introduce two geometric reward functions for 3D/4D scene generation by using pose-free feed-forward scene reconstruction models.

Unlike existing methods that rely on iterative depth estimation and image inpainting, often leading to geometric distortions and inconsistencies, WonderVerse leverages the powerful world-level priors embedded within video generative foundation models to create highly immersive and geometrically coherent 3D environments. Furthermore, we propose a new technique for controllable 3D scene extension to substantially increase the scale of the generated environments. Besides, we introduce a novel abnormal sequence detection module that utilizes camera trajectory to address geometric inconsistency in the generated videos. Finally, WonderVerse is compatible with various 3D reconstruction methods, allowing both efficient and high-quality generation.

These models can distort embedded watermarks during editing, posing significant challenges to copyright protection. In this work, we introduce W-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of watermarking methods against a wide range of image editing techniques, including image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation. Through extensive evaluations of eleven representative watermarking methods against prevalent editing techniques, we demonstrate that most methods fail to detect watermarks after such edits. To address this limitation, we propose VINE, a watermarking method that significantly enhances robustness against various image editing techniques while maintaining high image quality. Our approach involves two key innovations: (1) we analyze the frequency characteristics of image editing and identify that blurring distortions exhibit similar frequency properties, which allows us to use them as surrogate attacks during training to bolster watermark robustness; (2) we leverage a large-scale pretrained diffusion model SDXL-Turbo, adapting it for the watermarking task to achieve more imperceptible and robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that our method achieves outstanding watermarking performance under various image editing techniques, outperforming existing methods in both image quality and robustness.

However, altering camera trajectories of a given video remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation. It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories. The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video conditioning mechanism -- its capability often overlooked in current research. To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5, which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics, covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments tell that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines. Our method also finds promising applications in video stabilization, super-resolution, and outpainting.

It introduces additional redundancy, abrupt variations, and a domain gap between language and vision tokens while generation. Addressing these challenges requires an effective video tokenizer that can efficiently encode video data while preserving essential semantic and spatiotemporal information, serving as a critical bridge between text and vision. Inspired by the observation in VQ-VAE-2 and workflows of traditional animation, we propose HiTVideo for text-to-video generation with hierarchical tokenizers. It utilizes a 3D causal VAE with a multi-layer discrete token framework, encoding video content into hierarchically structured codebooks. Higher layers capture semantic information with higher compression, while lower layers focus on fine-grained spatiotemporal details, striking a balance between compression efficiency and reconstruction quality. Our approach efficiently encodes longer video sequences (e.g., 8 seconds, 64 frames), reducing bits per pixel (bpp) by approximately 70\% compared to baseline tokenizers, while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. We explore the trade-offs between compression and reconstruction, while emphasizing the advantages of high-compressed semantic tokens in text-to-video tasks. HiTVideo aims to address the potential limitations of existing video tokenizers in text-to-video generation tasks, striving for higher compression ratios and simplify LLMs modeling under language guidance, offering a scalable and promising framework for advancing text to video generation.

Current datasets, such as Ego4D, often suffer from inconsistent view perspectives and misaligned interactions, leading to reduced video quality and limiting their applicability for precise imitation learning tasks. Towards this end, we introduce TASTE-Rob -- a pioneering large-scale dataset of 100,856 ego-centric hand-object interaction videos. Each video is meticulously aligned with language instructions and recorded from a consistent camera viewpoint to ensure interaction clarity. By fine-tuning a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) on TASTE-Rob, we achieve realistic object interactions, though we observed occasional inconsistencies in hand grasping postures. To enhance realism, we introduce a three-stage pose-refinement pipeline that improves hand posture accuracy in generated videos. Our curated dataset, coupled with the specialized pose-refinement framework, provides notable performance gains in generating high-quality, task-oriented hand-object interaction videos, resulting in achieving superior generalizable robotic manipulation. The TASTE-Rob dataset will be made publicly available upon publication to foster further advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025</p></details> |

The advent of powerful text-to-video diffusion models has opened a promising pathway for music-video (MV) generation by first addressing the music-to-MV description task and subsequently leveraging these models for video generation. In this study, we focus on the MV description generation task and propose a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training data construction and multimodal model fine-tuning. We fine-tune existing pre-trained multimodal models on our newly constructed music-to-MV description dataset based on the Music4All dataset, which integrates both musical and visual information. Our experimental results demonstrate that music representations can be effectively mapped to textual domains, enabling the generation of meaningful MV description directly from music inputs. We also identify key components in the dataset construction pipeline that critically impact the quality of MV description and highlight specific musical attributes that warrant greater focus for improved MV description generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RepL4NLP 2025 @ NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[SAFREE: Training-Free and Adaptive Guard for Safe Text-to-Image And Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12761v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly enhanced their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, but they have also increased the risk of producing unsafe content. Existing unlearning/editing-based methods for safe generation remove harmful concepts from models but face several challenges: (1) They cannot instantly remove harmful concepts without training. (2) Their safe generation capabilities depend on collected training data. (3) They alter model weights, risking degradation in quality for content unrelated to toxic concepts. To address these, we propose SAFREE, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I and T2V, that does not alter the model's weights. Specifically, we detect a subspace corresponding to a set of toxic concepts in the text embedding space and steer prompt embeddings away from this subspace, thereby filtering out harmful content while preserving intended semantics. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving safe concepts, SAFREE incorporates a novel self-validating filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the denoising steps when applying the filtered embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate adaptive re-attention mechanisms within the diffusion latent space to selectively diminish the influence of features related to toxic concepts at the pixel level. In the end, SAFREE ensures coherent safety checking, preserving the fidelity, quality, and safety of the output. SAFREE achieves SOTA performance in suppressing unsafe content in T2I generation compared to training-free baselines and effectively filters targeted concepts while maintaining high-quality images. It also shows competitive results against training-based methods. We extend SAFREE to various T2I backbones and T2V tasks, showcasing its flexibility and generalization. SAFREE provides a robust and adaptable safeguard for ensuring safe visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; The first two authors contributed equally; Project page: https://safree-safe-t2i-t2v.github.io/</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor (TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser (MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D motion compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tora excels in achieving high motion fidelity compared to the foundational DiT model, while also accurately simulating the complex movements of the physical world.

High content and motion fidelity aligned with text prompts, however, often require large model parameters and a substantial number of function evaluations (NFEs). Realistic and visually appealing details are typically reflected in high resolution outputs, further amplifying computational demands especially for single stage DiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two stage framework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs across stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage, prompt fidelity is prioritized through a low resolution generation process utilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational efficiency. The second stage establishes flow matching between low and high resolutions, effectively generating fine details with minimal NFEs. Quantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves state-of-the-art high resolution video generation with superior computational efficiency. Additionally, the two-stage design enables users to preview the initial output and accordingly adjust the prompt before committing to full-resolution generation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs and wait times as well as enhancing commercial viability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Model...</summary><p>Model and Weight: https://github.com/FoundationVision/FlashVideo</p></details> |

However, tuning-based methods inherently tend to overfit the concepts, resulting in failure to create the concept under multiple conditions (*e.g.*, headphone is missing when generating "a `dog wearing a headphone"). Interestingly, we notice that the base model before fine-tuning exhibits the capability to compose the base concept with other elements (*e.g.*, "a dog wearing a headphone"), implying that the compositional ability only disappears after personalization tuning. We observe a semantic shift in the customized concept after fine-tuning, indicating that the personalized concept is not aligned with the original concept, and further show through theoretical analyses that this semantic shift leads to increased difficulty in sampling the joint conditional probability distribution, resulting in the loss of the compositional ability. Inspired by this finding, we present **ClassDiffusion**, a technique that leverages a **semantic preservation loss** to explicitly regulate the concept space when learning a new concept. Although simple, this approach effectively prevents semantic drift during the fine-tuning process of the target concepts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the use of semantic preservation loss effectively improves the compositional abilities of fine-tuning models. Lastly, we also extend our ClassDiffusion to personalized video generation, demonstrating its flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR2025, Code is available at https://github.com/Rbrq03/ClassDiffusion</p></details> |

Our findings reveal that these models lack comprehension of multiple image-level augmentations. To facilitate this study, we created an augmented version of the Flickr8k dataset, pairing each image with a detailed description of the applied transformation. We further explore how this deficiency impacts downstream tasks, particularly in image editing, and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art Image2Image models on simple transformations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 15 images |

Given the scarcity of available datasets with motion attribute annotations, existing methods struggle to generalize well in this task. In our work, the text input allows us to tap into the power of modern-day diffusion models to generate plausible motion samples for the right object category and part. In turn, the input 3D object provides image prompting to personalize the generated video to that very object we wish to articulate. Our method starts with a few-shot finetuning for category-specific motion generation, a key first step to compensate for the lack of articulation awareness by current diffusion models. For this, we finetune a pre-trained multi-view image generation model for controllable multi-view video generation, using a small collection of video samples obtained for the target object category. This is followed by motion video personalization that is realized by multi-view rendered images of the target 3D object. At last, we transfer the personalized video motion to the target 3D object via differentiable rendering to optimize part motion parameters by a score distillation sampling loss. Experimental results on PartNet-Sapien and ACD datasets show that our method is capable of generating realistic motion videos and predicting 3D motion parameters in a more accurate and generalizable way, compared to prior works in the few-shot setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 16 pages</p></details> |

Previous camera-conditioned video generative models suffer from diminished video dynamics and limited range of viewpoints when generating videos with large camera movement. We take an approach that progressively expands the generation of dynamic scenes -- first enhancing dynamic content within individual video clip, then extending this capability to create seamless explorations across broad viewpoint ranges. Specifically, we construct a dataset featuring a large degree of dynamics with camera parameter annotations for training while designing a lightweight camera injection module and training scheme to preserve dynamics of the pretrained models. Building on these improved single-clip techniques, we enable extended scene exploration by allowing users to iteratively specify camera trajectories for generating coherent video sequences. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that CameraCtrl Ii enables camera-controlled dynamic scene synthesis with substantially wider spatial exploration than previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hehao13.github.io/Projects-CameraCtrl-II/</p></details> |

However, real-world narrative videos require multi-shot scenes with visual and dynamic consistency across shots. In this work, we introduce Long Context Tuning (LCT), a training paradigm that expands the context window of pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models to learn scene-level consistency directly from data. Our method expands full attention mechanisms from individual shots to encompass all shots within a scene, incorporating interleaved 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy, enabling both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. Models with bidirectional attention after LCT can further be fine-tuned with context-causal attention, facilitating auto-regressive generation with efficient KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate single-shot models after LCT can produce coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibit emerging capabilities, including compositional generation and interactive shot extension, paving the way for more practical visual content creation.

By introducing a block-wise autoregressive unit, ACDiT offers a flexible interpolation between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion, bypassing the limitations of discrete tokenization. The generation of each block is formulated as a conditional diffusion process, conditioned on prior blocks. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) on standard diffusion transformer during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We show that ACDiT performs best among all autoregressive baselines under similar model scales on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefiting from autoregressive modeling, pretrained ACDiT can be transferred in visual understanding tasks despite being trained with the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. We hope that ACDiT offers a novel perspective on visual autoregressive generation and unlocks new avenues for unified models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CINEMA: Coherent Multi-Subject Video Generation via MLLM-Based Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10391v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of deep generative models, particularly diffusion models. While existing methods excel in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or single images, personalized multi-subject video generation remains a largely unexplored challenge. This task involves synthesizing videos that incorporate multiple distinct subjects, each defined by separate reference images, while ensuring temporal and spatial consistency. Current approaches primarily rely on mapping subject images to keywords in text prompts, which introduces ambiguity and limits their ability to model subject relationships effectively. In this paper, we propose CINEMA, a novel framework for coherent multi-subject video generation by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach eliminates the need for explicit correspondences between subject images and text entities, mitigating ambiguity and reducing annotation effort. By leveraging MLLM to interpret subject relationships, our method facilitates scalability, enabling the use of large and diverse datasets for training. Furthermore, our framework can be conditioned on varying numbers of subjects, offering greater flexibility in personalized content creation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves subject consistency, and overall video coherence, paving the way for advanced applications in storytelling, interactive media, and personalized video generation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce the first application of a pretrained transformer-based video generative model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and generates highly dynamic, realistic videos for portrait animation, effectively addressing these challenges. The adoption of a new video backbone model makes previous U-Net-based methods for identity maintenance, audio conditioning, and video extrapolation inapplicable. To address this limitation, we design an identity reference network consisting of a causal 3D VAE combined with a stacked series of transformer layers, ensuring consistent facial identity across video sequences. Additionally, we investigate various speech audio conditioning and motion frame mechanisms to enable the generation of continuous video driven by speech audio. Our method is validated through experiments on benchmark and newly proposed wild datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods in generating realistic portraits characterized by diverse orientations within dynamic and immersive scenes.

| **[Semantic Latent Motion for Portrait Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10096v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in portrait video generation have been noteworthy. However, existing methods rely heavily on human priors and pre-trained generation models, which may introduce unrealistic motion and lead to inefficient inference. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Latent Motion (SeMo), a compact and expressive motion representation. Leveraging this representation, our approach achieve both high-quality visual results and efficient inference. SeMo follows an effective three-step framework: Abstraction, Reasoning, and Generation. First, in the Abstraction step, we use a carefully designed Mask Motion Encoder to compress the subject's motion state into a compact and abstract latent motion (1D token). Second, in the Reasoning step, long-term modeling and efficient reasoning are performed in this latent space to generate motion sequences. Finally, in the Generation step, the motion dynamics serve as conditional information to guide the generation model in synthesizing realistic transitions from reference frames to target frames. Thanks to the compact and descriptive nature of Semantic Latent Motion, our method enables real-time video generation with highly realistic motion. User studies demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models with an 81% win rate in realism. Extensive experiments further highlight its strong compression capability, reconstruction quality, and generative potential. Moreover, its fully self-supervised nature suggests promising applications in broader video generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[UVE: Are MLLMs Unified Evaluators for AI-Generated Videos?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09949v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of video generative models (VGMs), it is essential to develop reliable and comprehensive automatic metrics for AI-generated videos (AIGVs). Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 16 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.

| **[VideoMerge: Towards Training-free Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09926v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video generation remains a challenging and compelling topic in computer vision. Diffusion based models, among the various approaches to video generation, have achieved state of the art quality with their iterative denoising procedures. However, the intrinsic complexity of the video domain renders the training of such diffusion models exceedingly expensive in terms of both data curation and computational resources. Moreover, these models typically operate on a fixed noise tensor that represents the video, resulting in predetermined spatial and temporal dimensions. Although several high quality open-source pretrained video diffusion models, jointly trained on images and videos of varying lengths and resolutions, are available, it is generally not recommended to specify a video length at inference that was not included in the training set. Consequently, these models are not readily adaptable to the direct generation of longer videos by merely increasing the specified video length. In addition to feasibility challenges, long-video generation also encounters quality issues. The domain of long videos is inherently more complex than that of short videos: extended durations introduce greater variability and necessitate long-range temporal consistency, thereby increasing the overall difficulty of the task. We propose VideoMerge, a training-free method that can be seamlessly adapted to merge short videos generated by pretrained text-to-video diffusion model. Our approach preserves the model's original expressiveness and consistency while allowing for extended duration and dynamic variation as specified by the user. By leveraging the strengths of pretrained models, our method addresses challenges related to smoothness, consistency, and dynamic content through orthogonal strategies that operate collaboratively to achieve superior quality.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in image and video synthesis using diffusion models, producing high-quality stereo videos remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of maintaining consistent temporal and spatial coherence between left and right views. We introduce StereoCrafter-Zero, a novel framework for zero-shot stereo video generation that leverages video diffusion priors without requiring paired training data. Our key innovations include a noisy restart strategy to initialize stereo-aware latent representations and an iterative refinement process that progressively harmonizes the latent space, addressing issues like temporal flickering and view inconsistencies. In addition, we propose the use of dissolved depth maps to streamline latent space operations by reducing high-frequency depth information. Our comprehensive evaluations, including quantitative metrics and user studies, demonstrate that StereoCrafter-Zero produces high-quality stereo videos with enhanced depth consistency and temporal smoothness, even when depth estimations are imperfect. Our framework is robust and adaptable across various diffusion models, setting a new benchmark for zero-shot stereo video generation and enabling more immersive visual experiences.

While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K 256x256 and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 17x256x256.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 22 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[LuciBot: Automated Robot Policy Learning from Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09871v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generating training supervision for embodied tasks is crucial, as manual designing is tedious and not scalable. While prior works use large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rewards, these approaches are largely limited to simple tasks with well-defined rewards, such as pick-and-place. This limitation arises because LLMs struggle to interpret complex scenes compressed into text or code due to their restricted input modality, while VLM-based rewards, though better at visual perception, remain limited by their less expressive output modality. To address these challenges, we leverage the imagination capability of general-purpose video generation models. Given an initial simulation frame and a textual task description, the video generation model produces a video demonstrating task completion with correct semantics. We then extract rich supervisory signals from the generated video, including 6D object pose sequences, 2D segmentations, and estimated depth, to facilitate task learning in simulation. Our approach significantly improves supervision quality for complex embodied tasks, enabling large-scale training in simulators.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines the precision of a computer graphics pipeline, enabling accurate control over elements such as camera movement, object rotation, and character animation, with the visual fidelity of generative AI to produce high-quality videos from coarsely rendered inputs. To support animations with any initial start point and extended sequences, we adopt a two-stage generation process guided by 3D geometry: 1) 3D-Guided Keyframe Generation, where a customized image diffusion model refines rendered keyframes to ensure consistency and quality, and 2) 3D-Guided Video Interpolation, a training-free approach that generates smooth, high-quality video frames between keyframes using bidirectional guidance. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our framework in producing controllable, high-quality animations from single input images by harmonizing 3D geometry with generative models. The code for our framework will be publicly released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://bestzzhang.github.io/I2V3D</p></details> |

This work studies the process of post-training these models for accurate world modeling through the lens of the simple, yet fundamental, physics task of modeling object freefall. We show state-of-the-art video generation models struggle with this basic task, despite their visually impressive outputs. To remedy this problem, we find that fine-tuning on a relatively small amount of simulated videos is effective in inducing the dropping behavior in the model, and we can further improve results through a novel reward modeling procedure we introduce. Our study also reveals key limitations of post-training in generalization and distribution modeling. Additionally, we release a benchmark for this task that may serve as a useful diagnostic tool for tracking physical accuracy in large-scale video generative model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion Sampling via Exploiting Local Transition Coherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09675v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in generating high-quality images and videos from textual descriptions. However, the lengthy sampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in practical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical relationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity between them, which often only works with specific network structures. To address this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the transition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the outputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on the network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel training-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified relationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent steps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure, LTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to almost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with them. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up sampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining competitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of 1.67-fold in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55-fold in video generation models. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable 10-fold speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than 16FPS.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce MaskFlow, a unified video generation framework that combines discrete representations with flow-matching to enable efficient generation of high-quality long videos. By leveraging a frame-level masking strategy during training, MaskFlow conditions on previously generated unmasked frames to generate videos with lengths ten times beyond that of the training sequences. MaskFlow does so very efficiently by enabling the use of fast Masked Generative Model (MGM)-style sampling and can be deployed in both fully autoregressive as well as full-sequence generation modes. We validate the quality of our method on the FaceForensics (FFS) and Deepmind Lab (DMLab) datasets and report Frechet Video Distance (FVD) competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. We also provide a detailed analysis on the sampling efficiency of our method and demonstrate that MaskFlow can be applied to both timestep-dependent and timestep-independent models in a training-free manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://compvis.github.io/maskflow/</p></details> |

However, theoretical analyses of these models remain scant. In this work, we develop theoretical underpinnings for these models and use our insights to improve the performance of existing models. We first develop Meta-ARVDM, a unified framework of ARVDMs that subsumes most existing methods. Using Meta-ARVDM, we analyze the KL-divergence between the videos generated by Meta-ARVDM and the true videos. Our analysis uncovers two important phenomena inherent to ARVDM -- error accumulation and memory bottleneck. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility result, we show that the memory bottleneck phenomenon cannot be avoided. To mitigate the memory bottleneck, we design various network structures to explicitly use more past frames. We also achieve a significantly improved trade-off between the mitigation of the memory bottleneck and the inference efficiency by compressing the frames. Experimental results on DMLab and Minecraft validate the efficacy of our methods. Our experiments also demonstrate a Pareto-frontier between the error accumulation and memory bottleneck across different methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-Centric World Model for Language-Guided Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06170v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model is essential for an agent to predict the future and plan in domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. To achieve this, recent advancements have focused on video generation, which has gained significant attention due to the impressive success of diffusion models. However, these models require substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a world model leveraging object-centric representation space using slot attention, guided by language instructions. Our model perceives the current state as an object-centric representation and predicts future states in this representation space conditioned on natural language instructions. This approach results in a more compact and computationally efficient model compared to diffusion-based generative alternatives. Furthermore, it flexibly predicts future states based on language instructions, and offers a significant advantage in manipulation tasks where object recognition is crucial. In this paper, we demonstrate that our latent predictive world model surpasses generative world models in visuo-linguo-motor control tasks, achieving superior sample and computation efficiency. We also investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method and explore various strategies for predicting actions using object-centric representations.</p></details> |  |

We utilize colormap to represent entity masks and depth maps, tightly integrating dense prediction with RGB video generation. Introducing dense prediction information improves video generation's consistency and motion smoothness without increasing computational costs. Incorporating learnable task embeddings brings multiple dense prediction tasks into a single model, enhancing flexibility and further boosting performance. We further propose a large-scale dense prediction video dataset~\datasetname, addressing the issue that existing datasets do not concurrently contain captions, videos, segmentation, or depth maps. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of our method, surpassing the state-of-the-art in terms of video quality, consistency, and motion smoothness.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

| **[Señorita-2M: A High-Quality Instruction-based Dataset for General Video Editing by Video Specialists](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06734v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have spurred the development of video editing techniques, which can be divided into inversion-based and end-to-end methods. However, current video editing methods still suffer from several challenges. Inversion-based methods, though training-free and flexible, are time-consuming during inference, struggle with fine-grained editing instructions, and produce artifacts and jitter. On the other hand, end-to-end methods, which rely on edited video pairs for training, offer faster inference speeds but often produce poor editing results due to a lack of high-quality training video pairs. In this paper, to close the gap in end-to-end methods, we introduce Se\~norita-2M, a high-quality video editing dataset. Se\~norita-2M consists of approximately 2 millions of video editing pairs. It is built by crafting four high-quality, specialized video editing models, each crafted and trained by our team to achieve state-of-the-art editing results. We also propose a filtering pipeline to eliminate poorly edited video pairs. Furthermore, we explore common video editing architectures to identify the most effective structure based on current pre-trained generative model. Extensive experiments show that our dataset can help to yield remarkably high-quality video editing results. More details are available at https://senorita-2m-dataset.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neighboring Autoregressive Modeling for Efficient Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10696v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual autoregressive models typically adhere to a raster-order ``next-token prediction" paradigm, which overlooks the spatial and temporal locality inherent in visual content. Specifically, visual tokens exhibit significantly stronger correlations with their spatially or temporally adjacent tokens compared to those that are distant. In this paper, we propose Neighboring Autoregressive Modeling (NAR), a novel paradigm that formulates autoregressive visual generation as a progressive outpainting procedure, following a near-to-far ``next-neighbor prediction" mechanism. Starting from an initial token, the remaining tokens are decoded in ascending order of their Manhattan distance from the initial token in the spatial-temporal space, progressively expanding the boundary of the decoded region. To enable parallel prediction of multiple adjacent tokens in the spatial-temporal space, we introduce a set of dimension-oriented decoding heads, each predicting the next token along a mutually orthogonal dimension. During inference, all tokens adjacent to the decoded tokens are processed in parallel, substantially reducing the model forward steps for generation. Experiments on ImageNet$256\times 256$ and UCF101 demonstrate that NAR achieves 2.4$\times$ and 8.6$\times$ higher throughput respectively, while obtaining superior FID/FVD scores for both image and video generation tasks compared to the PAR-4X approach. When evaluating on text-to-image generation benchmark GenEval, NAR with 0.8B parameters outperforms Chameleon-7B while using merely 0.4 of the training data.

The quality of AI video continues to improve, but at the cost of larger model size, increased data quantity, and greater demand for training compute. In this report, we present Open-Sora 2.0, a commercial-level video generation model trained for only $200k. With this model, we demonstrate that the cost of training a top-performing video generation model is highly controllable. We detail all techniques that contribute to this efficiency breakthrough, including data curation, model architecture, training strategy, and system optimization. According to human evaluation results and VBench scores, Open-Sora 2.0 is comparable to global leading video generation models including the open-source HunyuanVideo and the closed-source Runway Gen-3 Alpha.

By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing approaches that rely on priors from multi-view image and video generation models, our method is based on native 3D mesh generation models. Naively applying 3D mesh generation models to generate a mesh for each frame in a 4D task can lead to issues such as incorrect mesh poses, misalignment of mesh appearance, and inconsistencies in mesh geometry and texture maps. To address these problems, we propose a structured workflow that includes camera search and mesh reposing, condition embedding optimization for mesh appearance refinement, pairwise mesh registration for topology consistency, and global texture map optimization for texture consistency. Our method outputs high-quality 4D animated assets that are compatible with mainstream graphics and game software. Experimental results across a variety of animation types and motion amplitudes demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method.

This relaxed criterion enables substantial improvements in compression ratios without compromising the quality of downstream generative models. Specifically, we propose replacing the conventional encoder-decoder video embedder with an encoder-generator framework that employs a diffusion transformer (DiT) to synthesize missing details from a compact latent space. Therein, we develop a dedicated latent conditioning module to condition the DiT decoder on the encoded video latent embedding. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach enables superior encoding-decoding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the compression ratio increases. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we report results from our video embedders achieving a temporal compression ratio of up to 32x (8x higher than leading video embedders) and validate the robustness of this ultra-compact latent space for text-to-video generation, providing a significant efficiency boost in latent diffusion model training and inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning-Free Multi-Event Long Video Generation via Synchronized Coupled Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08605v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in text-to-video diffusion models enable high-quality short video generation from a single prompt, generating real-world long videos in a single pass remains challenging due to limited data and high computational costs. To address this, several works propose tuning-free approaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation, specifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content changes. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions between adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of semantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose Synchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that synchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range consistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two complementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling, which ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence, respectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns denoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended content changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS synchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise, ensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive experiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video generation, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence, outperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page with visuals: https://syncos2025.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives.

However, the leading video generation models remain closed-source, resulting in a notable performance gap between industry capabilities and those available to the public. In this report, we introduce HunyuanVideo, an innovative open-source video foundation model that demonstrates performance in video generation comparable to, or even surpassing, that of leading closed-source models. HunyuanVideo encompasses a comprehensive framework that integrates several key elements, including data curation, advanced architectural design, progressive model scaling and training, and an efficient infrastructure tailored for large-scale model training and inference. As a result, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13 billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. We conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to ensure high visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced filming techniques. According to evaluations by professionals, HunyuanVideo outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6, and three top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code for the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source communities.

However, current T2V models struggle to grasp abstract physical principles and generate videos that adhere to physical laws. This challenge arises primarily from a lack of clear guidance on physical information due to a significant gap between abstract physical principles and generation models. To this end, we introduce the World Simulator Assistant (WISA), an effective framework for decomposing and incorporating physical principles into T2V models. Specifically, WISA decomposes physical principles into textual physical descriptions, qualitative physical categories, and quantitative physical properties. To effectively embed these physical attributes into the generation process, WISA incorporates several key designs, including Mixture-of-Physical-Experts Attention (MoPA) and a Physical Classifier, enhancing the model's physics awareness. Furthermore, most existing datasets feature videos where physical phenomena are either weakly represented or entangled with multiple co-occurring processes, limiting their suitability as dedicated resources for learning explicit physical principles. We propose a novel video dataset, WISA-32K, collected based on qualitative physical categories. It consists of 32,000 videos, representing 17 physical laws across three domains of physics: dynamics, thermodynamics, and optics. Experimental results demonstrate that WISA can effectively enhance the compatibility of T2V models with real-world physical laws, achieving a considerable improvement on the VideoPhy benchmark.

Further pursuing the unification of generation and editing tasks has yielded significant progress in the domain of image content creation. However, due to the intrinsic demands for consistency across both temporal and spatial dynamics, achieving a unified approach for video synthesis remains challenging. We introduce VACE, which enables users to perform Video tasks within an All-in-one framework for Creation and Editing. These tasks include reference-to-video generation, video-to-video editing, and masked video-to-video editing. Specifically, we effectively integrate the requirements of various tasks by organizing video task inputs, such as editing, reference, and masking, into a unified interface referred to as the Video Condition Unit (VCU). Furthermore, by utilizing a Context Adapter structure, we inject different task concepts into the model using formalized representations of temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing it to handle arbitrary video synthesis tasks flexibly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the unified model of VACE achieves performance on par with task-specific models across various subtasks. Simultaneously, it enables diverse applications through versatile task combinations.

We present four key contributions to address the challenges of spatiotemporal video processing. First, we introduce the 3D Mobile Inverted Vector-Quantization Variational Autoencoder (3D-MBQ-VAE), which combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with masked token modeling to enhance spatiotemporal video compression. The model achieves superior temporal consistency and state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality by employing a novel training strategy with full frame masking. Second, we present MotionAura, a text-to-video generation framework that utilizes vector-quantized diffusion models to discretize the latent space and capture complex motion dynamics, producing temporally coherent videos aligned with text prompts. Third, we propose a spectral transformer-based denoising network that processes video data in the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform. This method effectively captures global context and long-range dependencies for high-quality video generation and denoising. Lastly, we introduce a downstream task of Sketch Guided Video Inpainting. This task leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our models achieve SOTA performance on a range of benchmarks.

This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of T2V-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-to-video outputs remain challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed T2VEval-Bench, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset for text-to-video quality evaluation, which contains 148 textual prompts and 1,783 videos generated by 13 T2V models. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we scored each video on four dimensions in the subjective experiment, which are overall impression, text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Based on T2VEval-Bench, we developed T2VEval, a multi-branch fusion scheme for T2V quality evaluation. T2VEval assesses videos across three branches: text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large language model. Additionally, we implemented a divide-and-conquer training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Physics Simulation for 3D Scenes via MLLM-Guided Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12789v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in 3D generation models have opened new possibilities for simulating dynamic 3D object movements and customizing behaviors, yet creating this content remains challenging. Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present ObjectMover, a generative model that can perform object movement in highly challenging scenes. Our key insight is that we model this task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and fine-tune a video generation model to leverage its knowledge of consistent object generation across video frames. We show that with this approach, our model is able to adjust to complex real-world scenarios, handling extreme lighting harmonization and object effect movement. As large-scale data for object movement are unavailable, we construct a data generation pipeline using a modern game engine to synthesize high-quality data pairs. We further propose a multi-task learning strategy that enables training on real-world video data to improve the model generalization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ObjectMover achieves outstanding results and adapts well to real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://xinyu-andy.github.io/ObjMover</p></details> |

Unlike previous approaches that process flattened local visual patches via direct discretization or adaptive query tokenization, SweetTok proposes a decoupling framework, compressing visual inputs through distinct spatial and temporal queries via \textbf{D}ecoupled \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (DQAE). This design allows SweetTok to efficiently compress video token count while achieving superior fidelity by capturing essential information across spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, we design a \textbf{M}otion-enhanced \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{C}odebook (MLC) tailored for spatial and temporal compression to address the differences in semantic representation between appearance and motion information. SweetTok significantly improves video reconstruction results by \textbf{42.8\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 dataset. With a better token compression strategy, it also boosts downstream video generation results by \textbf{15.1\%} w.r.t gFVD. Additionally, the compressed decoupled tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

Examining Teachers' Perspectives through TPACK and TAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08003v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of generative AI technology, particularly video generative AI (Video GenAI), has opened new possibilities for K-12 education by enabling the creation of dynamic, customized, and high-quality visual content. Despite its potential, there is limited research on how this emerging technology can be effectively integrated into educational practices. This study explores the perspectives of leading K-12 teachers on the educational applications of Video GenAI, using the TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) and TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) frameworks as analytical lenses. Through interviews and hands-on experimentation with video generation tools, the research identifies opportunities for enhancing teaching strategies, fostering student engagement, and supporting authentic task design. It also highlights challenges such as technical limitations, ethical considerations, and the need for institutional support.

This paper proposes LightMotion, a light and tuning-free method for simulating camera motion in video generation. Operating in the latent space, it eliminates additional fine-tuning, inpainting, and depth estimation, making it more streamlined than existing methods. The endeavors of this paper comprise: (i) The latent space permutation operation effectively simulates various camera motions like panning, zooming, and rotation. (ii) The latent space resampling strategy combines background-aware sampling and cross-frame alignment to accurately fill new perspectives while maintaining coherence across frames. (iii) Our in-depth analysis shows that the permutation and resampling cause an SNR shift in latent space, leading to poor-quality generation. To address this, we propose latent space correction, which reintroduces noise during denoising to mitigate SNR shift and enhance video generation quality. Exhaustive experiments show that our LightMotion outperforms existing methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | 18 pages in total |

The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that facilitates bidirectional information exchange between video and audio diffusion models through temporally-aligned self attention operations. Unlike prior work that uses dedicated models for A2V and V2A tasks and relies on pretrained feature extractors, AV-Link achieves both tasks in a single self-contained framework, directly leveraging features obtained by the complementary modality (i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video). Extensive automatic and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial improvement in audio-video synchronization, outperforming more expensive baselines such as the MovieGen video-to-audio model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: snap-research.github.io/AVLink/</p></details> |
| **[DreamRelation: Relation-Centric Video Customization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07602v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational video customization refers to the creation of personalized videos that depict user-specified relations between two subjects, a crucial task for comprehending real-world visual content. While existing methods can personalize subject appearances and motions, they still struggle with complex relational video customization, where precise relational modeling and high generalization across subject categories are essential. The primary challenge arises from the intricate spatial arrangements, layout variations, and nuanced temporal dynamics inherent in relations; consequently, current models tend to overemphasize irrelevant visual details rather than capturing meaningful interactions. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRelation, a novel approach that personalizes relations through a small set of exemplar videos, leveraging two key components: Relational Decoupling Learning and Relational Dynamics Enhancement. First, in Relational Decoupling Learning, we disentangle relations from subject appearances using relation LoRA triplet and hybrid mask training strategy, ensuring better generalization across diverse relationships. Furthermore, we determine the optimal design of relation LoRA triplet by analyzing the distinct roles of the query, key, and value features within MM-DiT's attention mechanism, making DreamRelation the first relational video generation framework with explainable components. Second, in Relational Dynamics Enhancement, we introduce space-time relational contrastive loss, which prioritizes relational dynamics while minimizing the reliance on detailed subject appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamRelation outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relational video customization. Code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dreamrelation.github.io</p></details> |

Effective traversal of the latent space learned by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has been the basis for recent breakthroughs in image editing. However, the applicability of such advancements to the video domain has been hindered by the difficulty of representing and controlling videos in the latent space of GANs. In particular, videos are composed of content (i.e., appearance) and complex motion components that require a special mechanism to disentangle and control. To achieve this, VidStyleODE encodes the video content in a pre-trained StyleGAN $\mathcal{W}_+$ space and benefits from a latent ODE component to summarize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the input video. Our novel continuous video generation process then combines the two to generate high-quality and temporally consistent videos with varying frame rates. We show that our proposed method enables a variety of applications on real videos: text-guided appearance manipulation, motion manipulation, image animation, and video interpolation and extrapolation.

| **[AR-Diffusion: Asynchronous Video Generation with Auto-Regressive Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07418v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of video generation requires synthesizing visually realistic and temporally coherent video frames. Existing methods primarily use asynchronous auto-regressive models or synchronous diffusion models to address this challenge. However, asynchronous auto-regressive models often suffer from inconsistencies between training and inference, leading to issues such as error accumulation, while synchronous diffusion models are limited by their reliance on rigid sequence length. To address these issues, we introduce Auto-Regressive Diffusion (AR-Diffusion), a novel model that combines the strengths of auto-regressive and diffusion models for flexible, asynchronous video generation. Specifically, our approach leverages diffusion to gradually corrupt video frames in both training and inference, reducing the discrepancy between these phases. Inspired by auto-regressive generation, we incorporate a non-decreasing constraint on the corruption timesteps of individual frames, ensuring that earlier frames remain clearer than subsequent ones. This setup, together with temporal causal attention, enables flexible generation of videos with varying lengths while preserving temporal coherence. In addition, we design two specialized timestep schedulers: the FoPP scheduler for balanced timestep sampling during training, and the AD scheduler for flexible timestep differences during inference, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves competitive and state-of-the-art results across four challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) planning. MovieAgent offers two key advantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated movie/long-video generation. Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent can generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent narrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and stable audio throughout the film. 2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical CoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings, and cinematography, significantly reducing human effort. By employing multiple LLM agents to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter, storyboard artist, and location manager, MovieAgent streamlines the production pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that MovieAgent achieves new state-of-the-art results in script faithfulness, character consistency, and narrative coherence. Our hierarchical framework takes a step forward and provides new insights into fully automated movie generation.

| **[Learning to Animate Images from A Few Videos to Portray Delicate Human Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00276v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress, video generative models still struggle to animate static images into videos that portray delicate human actions, particularly when handling uncommon or novel actions whose training data are limited. In this paper, we explore the task of learning to animate images to portray delicate human actions using a small number of videos -- 16 or fewer -- which is highly valuable for real-world applications like video and movie production. Learning generalizable motion patterns that smoothly transition from user-provided reference images in a few-shot setting is highly challenging. We propose FLASH (Few-shot Learning to Animate and Steer Humans), which learns generalizable motion patterns by forcing the model to reconstruct a video using the motion features and cross-frame correspondences of another video with the same motion but different appearance. This encourages transferable motion learning and mitigates overfitting to limited training data. Additionally, FLASH extends the decoder with additional layers to propagate details from the reference image to generated frames, improving transition smoothness. Human judges overwhelmingly favor FLASH, with 65.78\% of 488 responses prefer FLASH over baselines. We strongly recommend watching the videos in the website: https://lihaoxin05.github.io/human_action_animation/, as motion artifacts are hard to notice from images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Dreamer: Boundary Conditional Motion Reasoning for Physically Coherent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00547v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation have shown promise for generating future scenarios, critical for planning and control in autonomous driving and embodied intelligence. However, real-world applications demand more than visually plausible predictions; they require reasoning about object motions based on explicitly defined boundary conditions, such as initial scene image and partial object motion. We term this capability Boundary Conditional Motion Reasoning. Current approaches either neglect explicit user-defined motion constraints, producing physically inconsistent motions, or conversely demand complete motion inputs, which are rarely available in practice. Here we introduce Motion Dreamer, a two-stage framework that explicitly separates motion reasoning from visual synthesis, addressing these limitations. Our approach introduces instance flow, a sparse-to-dense motion representation enabling effective integration of partial user-defined motions, and the motion inpainting strategy to robustly enable reasoning motions of other objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Motion Dreamer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior motion plausibility and visual realism, thus bridging the gap towards practical boundary conditional motion reasoning.

| **[E2ED^2:Direct Mapping from Noise to Data for Enhanced Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21044v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have established themselves as the de facto primary paradigm in visual generative modeling, revolutionizing the field through remarkable success across various diverse applications ranging from high-quality image synthesis to temporal aware video generation. Despite these advancements, three fundamental limitations persist, including 1) discrepancy between training and inference processes, 2) progressive information leakage throughout the noise corruption procedures, and 3) inherent constraints preventing effective integration of modern optimization criteria like perceptual and adversarial loss. To mitigate these critical challenges, we in this paper present a novel end-to-end learning paradigm that establishes direct optimization from the final generated samples to initial noises. Our proposed End-to-End Differentiable Diffusion, dubbed E2ED^2, introduces several key improvements: it eliminates the sequential training-sampling mismatch and intermediate information leakage via conceptualizing training as a direct transformation from isotropic Gaussian noise to the target data distribution. Additionally, such training framework enables seamless incorporation of adversarial and perceptual losses into the core optimization objective. Comprehensive evaluation across standard benchmarks including COCO30K and HW30K reveals that our method achieves substantial performance gains in terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP score, even with fewer sampling steps (less than 4). Our findings highlight that the end-to-end mechanism might pave the way for more robust and efficient solutions, \emph{i.e.,} combining diffusion stability with GAN-like discriminative optimization in an end-to-end manner.</p></details> | Technical report |

However, their adherence to physical commonsense across real-world actions remains unclear (e.g., playing tennis, backflip). Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations such as limited size, lack of human evaluation, sim-to-real gaps, and absence of fine-grained physical rule analysis. To address this, we introduce VideoPhy-2, an action-centric dataset for evaluating physical commonsense in generated videos. We curate 200 diverse actions and detailed prompts for video synthesis from modern generative models. We perform human evaluation that assesses semantic adherence, physical commonsense, and grounding of physical rules in the generated videos. Our findings reveal major shortcomings, with even the best model achieving only 22% joint performance (i.e., high semantic and physical commonsense adherence) on the hard subset of VideoPhy-2. We find that the models particularly struggle with conservation laws like mass and momentum. Finally, we also train VideoPhy-AutoEval, an automatic evaluator for fast, reliable assessment on our dataset. Overall, VideoPhy-2 serves as a rigorous benchmark, exposing critical gaps in video generative models and guiding future research in physically-grounded video generation.

However, they are still hard to meet requirements of applications due to unsatisfied generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose to align video foundation models with human preferences from the perspective of post-training in this paper. Consequently, we introduce an Iterative Preference Optimization strategy to enhance generated video quality by incorporating human feedback. Specifically, IPO exploits a critic model to justify video generations for pairwise ranking as in Direct Preference Optimization or point-wise scoring as in Kahneman-Tversky Optimization. Given this, IPO optimizes video foundation models with guidance of signals from preference feedback, which helps improve generated video quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. In addition, IPO incorporates the critic model with the multi-modality large language model, which enables it to automatically assign preference labels without need of retraining or relabeling. In this way, IPO can efficiently perform multi-round preference optimization in an iterative manner, without the need of tediously manual labeling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IPO can effectively improve the video generation quality of a pretrained model and help a model with only 2B parameters surpass the one with 5B parameters. Besides, IPO achieves new state-of-the-art performance on VBench benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[TR-DQ: Time-Rotation Diffusion Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06564v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been widely adopted in image and video generation. However, their complex network architecture leads to high inference overhead for its generation process. Existing diffusion quantization methods primarily focus on the quantization of the model structure while ignoring the impact of time-steps variation during sampling. At the same time, most current approaches fail to account for significant activations that cannot be eliminated, resulting in substantial performance degradation after quantization. To address these issues, we propose Time-Rotation Diffusion Quantization (TR-DQ), a novel quantization method incorporating time-step and rotation-based optimization. TR-DQ first divides the sampling process based on time-steps and applies a rotation matrix to smooth activations and weights dynamically. For different time-steps, a dedicated hyperparameter is introduced for adaptive timing modeling, which enables dynamic quantization across different time steps. Additionally, we also explore the compression potential of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG-wise) to establish a foundation for subsequent work. TR-DQ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on image generation and video generation tasks and a 1.38-1.89x speedup and 1.97-2.58x memory reduction in inference compared to existing quantization methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the enhanced capabilities of DiTs come with significant drawbacks, including increased computational and memory costs, which hinder their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Current acceleration techniques, such as quantization and cache mechanism, offer limited speedup and are often applied in isolation, failing to fully address the complexities of DiT architectures. In this paper, we propose QuantCache, a novel training-free inference acceleration framework that jointly optimizes hierarchical latent caching, adaptive importance-guided quantization, and structural redundancy-aware pruning. QuantCache achieves an end-to-end latency speedup of 6.72$\times$ on Open-Sora with minimal loss in generation quality.

Previous work has mapped the noise to new frames, a more computationally expensive process. Unfortunately, starting from the previous frame, instead of noise, is more prone to drifting errors. Hence, second, we additionally learn how to remove the accumulated errors as the joint objective by adding noise during training. We demonstrate unconditional video generation in a streaming manner for various video datasets, all at competitive quality compared to a baseline conditional diffusion but with higher speed, i.e., fewer ODE solver steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text2Story: Advancing Video Storytelling with Text Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06310v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating coherent long-form video sequences from discrete input using only text prompts is a critical task in content creation. While diffusion-based models excel at short video synthesis, long-form storytelling from text remains largely unexplored and a challenge due to challenges pertaining to temporal coherency, preserving semantic meaning and action continuity across the video. We introduce a novel storytelling approach to enable seamless video generation with natural action transitions and structured narratives. We present a bidirectional time-weighted latent blending strategy to ensure temporal consistency between segments of the long-form video being generated. Further, our method extends the Black-Scholes algorithm from prompt mixing for image generation to video generation, enabling controlled motion evolution through structured text conditioning. To further enhance motion continuity, we propose a semantic action representation framework to encode high-level action semantics into the blending process, dynamically adjusting transitions based on action similarity, ensuring smooth yet adaptable motion changes. Latent space blending maintains spatial coherence between objects in a scene, while time-weighted blending enforces bidirectional constraints for temporal consistency. This integrative approach prevents abrupt transitions while ensuring fluid storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, achieving temporally consistent and visually compelling video narratives without any additional training. Our approach bridges the gap between short clips and extended video to establish a new paradigm in GenAI-driven video synthesis from text.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Rethinking Video Tokenization: A Conditioned Diffusion-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03708v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video tokenizers typically use the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture for video compression and reconstruction. However, to achieve good performance, its training process often relies on complex multi-stage training tricks that go beyond basic reconstruction loss and KL regularization. Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise tuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate higher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel Conditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based decoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses spatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder reconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these latents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate videos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt sampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a basic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS perceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a single-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\times$ inference speedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent video generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The source code and pretrained weights will be released shortly, so please stay tuned for updates!</p></details> |  |
| **[The Best of Both Worlds: Integrating Language Models and Diffusion Models for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04606v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have been driven by two competing paradigms: autoregressive language models and diffusion models. However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a $\sim$14,000$\times$ compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Kling, and Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field.

| **[Self-Guidance: Boosting Flow and Diffusion Generation on Their Own](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05827v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proper guidance strategies are essential to achieve high-quality generation results without retraining diffusion and flow-based text-to-image models. Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, potentially limiting their applications. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which improves the image quality by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. SG only relies on the sampling probabilities of its own diffusion model at different noise levels with no need of any guidance-specific training. This makes it flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms, maximizing its potential to achieve competitive performances in many generative tasks. We conduct experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, Self-Guidance surpasses existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. Moreover, we find that SG has a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing its ability of eliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We will release our code along with this paper.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[VACT: A Video Automatic Causal Testing System and a Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06163v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of text-conditioned Video Generation Models (VGMs), the quality of generated videos has significantly improved, bringing these models closer to functioning as ``*world simulators*'' and making real-world-level video generation more accessible and cost-effective. However, the generated videos often contain factual inaccuracies and lack understanding of fundamental physical laws. While some previous studies have highlighted this issue in limited domains through manual analysis, a comprehensive solution has not yet been established, primarily due to the absence of a generalized, automated approach for modeling and assessing the causal reasoning of these models across diverse scenarios. To address this gap, we propose VACT: an **automated** framework for modeling, evaluating, and measuring the causal understanding of VGMs in real-world scenarios. By combining causal analysis techniques with a carefully designed large language model assistant, our system can assess the causal behavior of models in various contexts without human annotation, which offers strong generalization and scalability. Additionally, we introduce multi-level causal evaluation metrics to provide a detailed analysis of the causal performance of VGMs. As a demonstration, we use our framework to benchmark several prevailing VGMs, offering insight into their causal reasoning capabilities.

However, existing methods have limitations: 3D diffusion models are limited by dataset scarcity and the absence of strong pre-trained priors, while 2D diffusion-based approaches struggle with geometric consistency. We propose a method that leverages 2D diffusion models' implicit 3D reasoning ability while ensuring 3D consistency via Gaussian-splatting-based geometric distillation. Specifically, the proposed Gaussian Splatting Decoder enforces 3D consistency by transforming SV3D latent outputs into an explicit 3D representation. Unlike SV3D, which only relies on implicit 2D representations for video generation, Gaussian Splatting explicitly encodes spatial and appearance attributes, enabling multi-view consistency through geometric constraints. These constraints correct view inconsistencies, ensuring robust geometric consistency. As a result, our approach simultaneously generates high-quality, multi-view-consistent images and accurate 3D models, providing a scalable solution for single-image-based 3D generation and bridging the gap between 2D Diffusion diversity and 3D structural coherence. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art multi-view consistency and strong generalization across diverse datasets. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

To achieve greater control over generated results, researchers introduce additional architectures, such as ControlNet, Adapters and ReferenceNet, to integrate conditioning controls. However, current controllable generation methods often require substantial additional computational resources, especially for video generation, and face challenges in training or exhibit weak control. In this paper, we propose ControlNeXt: a powerful and efficient method for controllable image and video generation. We first design a more straightforward and efficient architecture, replacing heavy additional branches with minimal additional cost compared to the base model. Such a concise structure also allows our method to seamlessly integrate with other LoRA weights, enabling style alteration without the need for additional training. As for training, we reduce up to 90% of learnable parameters compared to the alternatives. Furthermore, we propose another method called Cross Normalization (CN) as a replacement for Zero-Convolution' to achieve fast and stable training convergence. We have conducted various experiments with different base models across images and videos, demonstrating the robustness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>contr...</summary><p>controllable generation</p></details> |

Recent generative approaches, boosted by large-scale pre-trained video generation models, show promise in handling intricate scenes. However, they frequently produce unstable motion and content inconsistencies due to the absence of explicit motion trajectory constraints. To address these challenges, we propose Motion-aware Generative frame interpolation (MoG) that synergizes intermediate flow guidance with generative capacities to enhance interpolation fidelity. Our key insight is to simultaneously enforce motion smoothness through flow constraints while adaptively correcting flow estimation errors through generative refinement. Specifically, we first introduce a dual guidance injection that propagates condition information using intermediate flow at both latent and feature levels, aligning the generated motion with flow-derived motion trajectories. Meanwhile, we implemented two critical designs, encoder-only guidance injection and selective parameter fine-tuning, which enable dynamic artifact correction in the complex motion regions. Extensive experiments on both real-world and animation benchmarks demonstrate that MoG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of video quality and visual fidelity. Our work bridges the gap between flow-based stability and generative flexibility, offering a versatile solution for frame interpolation across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06053v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Time: Temporally-Controlled Multi-Event Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05263v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world videos consist of sequences of events. Generating such sequences with precise temporal control is infeasible with existing video generators that rely on a single paragraph of text as input. When tasked with generating multiple events described using a single prompt, such methods often ignore some of the events or fail to arrange them in the correct order. To address this limitation, we present MinT, a multi-event video generator with temporal control. Our key insight is to bind each event to a specific period in the generated video, which allows the model to focus on one event at a time. To enable time-aware interactions between event captions and video tokens, we design a time-based positional encoding method, dubbed ReRoPE. This encoding helps to guide the cross-attention operation. By fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion transformer on temporally grounded data, our approach produces coherent videos with smoothly connected events. For the first time in the literature, our model offers control over the timing of events in generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MinT outperforms existing commercial and open-source models by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

It supports varied facial poses, including back-facing views, and animates single or multiple characters with input masks for precise speaker designation in multi-character scenes. Our approach tackles key challenges with three innovations: (1) 3D full-attention mechanisms with a sliding window denoising strategy, enabling infinite video generation with temporal coherence and visual quality across diverse character styles; (2) a two-stage curriculum learning scheme, integrating audio for lip sync, text for expressive dynamics, and reference images for identity preservation, enabling flexible multi-modal control over long sequences; and (3) region-specific masks with adaptive loss functions to balance global textual control and local audio guidance, supporting speaker-specific animations. Efficiency is enhanced via our innovative unified step and cfg distillation techniques, achieving a 20x inference speed boost over the basemodel: generating a 10 second 540x540p video in 10 seconds or 720x720p in 30 seconds on 8 H100 GPUs, without quality loss.

Rather than attempting to design and train a new multimodal audio-video model, we show how existing video diffusion models can be adapted to align with musical inputs by introducing lightweight music-video cross-attention and a low-rank adapter. Unlike prior work requiring motion capture data, our approach fine-tunes only on dance videos. MusicInfuser achieves high-quality music-driven video generation while preserving the flexibility and generative capabilities of the underlying models.

Existing works struggle to generate either large viewpoint changes or temporally smooth samples, while relying on specific task configurations. Our approach overcomes these limitations through simple model design, optimized training recipe, and flexible sampling strategy that generalize across view synthesis tasks at test time. As a result, our samples maintain high consistency without requiring additional 3D representation-based distillation, thus streamlining view synthesis in the wild. Furthermore, we show that our method can generate high-quality videos lasting up to half a minute with seamless loop closure. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that Seva outperforms existing methods across different datasets and settings.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that leverages the inherent heterogeneity of the diffusion process. Our method, DiffMoE, introduces a batch-level global token pool that enables experts to access global token distributions during training, promoting specialized expert behavior. To unleash the full potential of the diffusion process, DiffMoE incorporates a capacity predictor that dynamically allocates computational resources based on noise levels and sample complexity. Through comprehensive evaluation, DiffMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on ImageNet benchmark, substantially outperforming both dense architectures with 3x activated parameters and existing MoE approaches while maintaining 1x activated parameters. The effectiveness of our approach extends beyond class-conditional generation to more challenging tasks such as text-to-image generation, demonstrating its broad applicability across different diffusion model applications.

| **[Lux Post Facto: Learning Portrait Performance Relighting with Conditional Video Diffusion and a Hybrid Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14485v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video portrait relighting remains challenging because the results need to be both photorealistic and temporally stable. This typically requires a strong model design that can capture complex facial reflections as well as intensive training on a high-quality paired video dataset, such as dynamic one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). In this work, we introduce Lux Post Facto, a novel portrait video relighting method that produces both photorealistic and temporally consistent lighting effects. From the model side, we design a new conditional video diffusion model built upon state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model, alongside a new lighting injection mechanism to enable precise control. This way we leverage strong spatial and temporal generative capability to generate plausible solutions to the ill-posed relighting problem. Our technique uses a hybrid dataset consisting of static expression OLAT data and in-the-wild portrait performance videos to jointly learn relighting and temporal modeling. This avoids the need to acquire paired video data in different lighting conditions. Our extensive experiments show that our model produces state-of-the-art results both in terms of photorealism and temporal consistency.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[SIR-DIFF: Sparse Image Sets Restoration with Multi-View Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14463v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computer vision community has developed numerous techniques for digitally restoring true scene information from single-view degraded photographs, an important yet extremely ill-posed task. In this work, we tackle image restoration from a different perspective by jointly denoising multiple photographs of the same scene. Our core hypothesis is that degraded images capturing a shared scene contain complementary information that, when combined, better constrains the restoration problem. To this end, we implement a powerful multi-view diffusion model that jointly generates uncorrupted views by extracting rich information from multi-view relationships. Our experiments show that our multi-view approach outperforms existing single-view image and even video-based methods on image deblurring and super-resolution tasks. Critically, our model is trained to output 3D consistent images, making it a promising tool for applications requiring robust multi-view integration, such as 3D reconstruction or pose estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-for-More: Continual Diffusion Model for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19848v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of generative models, there is a growing interest in unifying all tasks within a generative framework. Anomaly detection methods also fall into this scope and utilize diffusion models to generate or reconstruct normal samples when given arbitrary anomaly images. However, our study found that the diffusion model suffers from severe ``faithfulness hallucination'' and ``catastrophic forgetting'', which can't meet the unpredictable pattern increments. To mitigate the above problems, we propose a continual diffusion model that uses gradient projection to achieve stable continual learning. Gradient projection deploys a regularization on the model updating by modifying the gradient towards the direction protecting the learned knowledge. But as a double-edged sword, it also requires huge memory costs brought by the Markov process. Hence, we propose an iterative singular value decomposition method based on the transitive property of linear representation, which consumes tiny memory and incurs almost no performance loss. Finally, considering the risk of ``over-fitting'' to normal images of the diffusion model, we propose an anomaly-masked network to enhance the condition mechanism of the diffusion model. For continual anomaly detection, ours achieves first place in 17/18 settings on MVTec and VisA. Code is available at https://github.com/FuNz-0/One-for-More</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Diffusion-based Facial Aesthetics Enhancement with 3D Structure Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14402v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial Aesthetics Enhancement (FAE) aims to improve facial attractiveness by adjusting the structure and appearance of a facial image while preserving its identity as much as possible. Most existing methods adopted deep feature-based or score-based guidance for generation models to conduct FAE. Although these methods achieved promising results, they potentially produced excessively beautified results with lower identity consistency or insufficiently improved facial attractiveness. To enhance facial aesthetics with less loss of identity, we propose the Nearest Neighbor Structure Guidance based on Diffusion (NNSG-Diffusion), a diffusion-based FAE method that beautifies a 2D facial image with 3D structure guidance. Specifically, we propose to extract FAE guidance from a nearest neighbor reference face. To allow for less change of facial structures in the FAE process, a 3D face model is recovered by referring to both the matched 2D reference face and the 2D input face, so that the depth and contour guidance can be extracted from the 3D face model. Then the depth and contour clues can provide effective guidance to Stable Diffusion with ControlNet for FAE. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is superior to previous relevant methods in enhancing facial aesthetics while preserving facial identity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memorization and Regularization in Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15785v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling. At the heart of the methodology is score matching: learning gradients of families of log-densities for noisy versions of the data distribution at different scales. When the loss function adopted in score matching is evaluated using empirical data, rather than the population loss, the minimizer corresponds to the score of a time-dependent Gaussian mixture. However, use of this analytically tractable minimizer leads to data memorization: in both unconditioned and conditioned settings, the generative model returns the training samples. This paper contains an analysis of the dynamical mechanism underlying memorization. The analysis highlights the need for regularization to avoid reproducing the analytically tractable minimizer; and, in so doing, lays the foundations for a principled understanding of how to regularize. Numerical experiments investigate the properties of: (i) Tikhonov regularization; (ii) regularization designed to promote asymptotic consistency; and (iii) regularizations induced by under-parameterization of a neural network or by early stopping when training a neural network. These experiments are evaluated in the context of memorization, and directions for future development of regularization are highlighted.</p></details> | 59 pages, 20 figures |

In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences.

However, as LVDM training scales, the computational overhead of Video VAEs becomes a critical bottleneck, particularly for encoding high-resolution videos. To address this, we propose LeanVAE, a novel and ultra-efficient Video VAE framework that introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight architecture based on a Neighborhood-Aware Feedforward (NAF) module and non-overlapping patch operations, drastically reducing computational cost, and (2) the integration of wavelet transforms and compressed sensing techniques to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments validate LeanVAE's superiority in video reconstruction and generation, particularly in enhancing efficiency over existing Video VAEs. Our model offers up to 50x fewer FLOPs and 44x faster inference speed while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, providing insights for scalable, efficient video generation.

Relying on a pre-trained LDR generative diffusion models is vital as, first, there is no sufficiently large HDR image dataset available to re-train them, and, second, even if it was, re-training such models is impossible for most compute budgets. Instead, we seek inspiration from the HDR image capture literature that traditionally fuses sets of LDR images, called "exposure brackets'', to produce a single HDR image. We operate multiple denoising processes to generate multiple LDR brackets that together form a valid HDR result. The key to making this work is to introduce a consistency term into the diffusion process to couple the brackets such that they agree across the exposure range they share while accounting for possible differences due to the quantization error. We demonstrate state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional or restoration-type (LDR2HDR) generative modeling results, yet in HDR.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 14 figures, Accepted to Eurographics 2025, see https://bracketdiffusion.mpi-inf.mpg.de</p></details> |

Traditional methods typically extract features from partial point clouds to predict missing regions, but the large solution space often leads to unsatisfactory results. More recent approaches have started to use images as extra guidance, effectively improving performance, but obtaining paired data of images and partial point clouds is challenging in practice. To overcome these limitations, we harness the relatively view-consistent multi-view diffusion priors within large models, to generate novel views of the desired shape. The resulting image set encodes both global and local shape cues, which are especially beneficial for shape completion. To fully exploit the priors, we have designed a shape fusion module for producing an initial complete shape from multi-modality input (i.e.,, images and point clouds), and a follow-up shape consolidation module to obtain the final complete shape by discarding unreliable points introduced by the inconsistency from diffusion priors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our superior performance, especially in recovering fine details.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle with under-erasure, leaving residual traces of targeted concepts, or over-erasure, mistakenly eliminating unrelated but visually similar concepts. To address these limitations, we introduce CRCE, a novel concept erasure framework that leverages Large Language Models to identify both semantically related concepts that should be erased alongside the target and distinct concepts that should be preserved. By explicitly modeling coreferential and retained concepts semantically, CRCE enables more precise concept removal, without unintended erasure. Experiments demonstrate that CRCE outperforms existing methods on diverse erasure tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

Generally, our method consists of three primary modules: (i) a facial extractor that captures versatile and precise facial features for each human ID from both global and local perspectives; (ii) a multi-scale projector that maps face embeddings into the contextual space of image query in video diffusion transformers; (iii) an ID router that dynamically combines and allocates multiple ID embedding to the corresponding space-time regions. Leveraging a meticulously curated text-video dataset and a multi-stage training protocol, Ingredients demonstrates superior performance in turning custom photos into dynamic and personalized video content. Qualitative evaluations highlight the advantages of proposed method, positioning it as a significant advancement toward more effective generative video control tools in Transformer-based architecture, compared to existing methods.

While extensive approaches have been proposed to erase unwanted concepts without requiring retraining from scratch, they inadvertently degrade performance on normal generation tasks. In this work, we propose Interpret then Deactivate (ItD), a novel framework to enable precise concept removal in T2I diffusion models while preserving overall performance. ItD first employs a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to interpret each concept as a combination of multiple features. By permanently deactivating the specific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a zero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target concepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we demonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without requiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity identities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's effectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal concept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial prompts designed to circumvent content filters.

Based on the pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, existing methods usually employ a project-and-inpaint approach, in which a view of the given object is first generated and warped to another view for inpainting. But it tends to generate inconsistent texture due to the asynchronous diffusion of multiple views. We believe such asynchronous diffusion and insufficient information sharing among views are the root causes of the inconsistent artifact. In this paper, we propose a synchronized multi-view diffusion approach that allows the diffusion processes from different views to reach a consensus of the generated content early in the process, and hence ensures the texture consistency. To synchronize the diffusion, we share the denoised content among different views in each denoising step, specifically blending the latent content in the texture domain from views with overlap. Our method demonstrates superior performance in generating consistent, seamless, highly detailed textures, comparing to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 11 figures, technical papers, "Text, Texturing, and Stylization"@SIGGRAPH Asia 2024</p></details> |

Such methods usually consider applications where the sinogram contains a sufficient amount of information for the posterior distribution to be concentrated around a single mode, and consequently are evaluated using image-to-image metrics such as PSNR/SSIM. Instead, we are interested in reconstructing compressible flow images from sinograms having a small number of projections, which results in a posterior distribution no longer concentrated or even multimodal. Thus, in this paper, we aim at evaluating the approximate posterior of PnP diffusion models and introduce two posterior evaluation properties. We quantitatively evaluate three PnP diffusion methods on three different datasets for several numbers of projections. We surprisingly find that, for each method, the approximate posterior deviates from the true posterior when the number of projections decreases.</p></details> |  |

Though demonstrating promising performance, they remain unable to handle real-time video streams and consume large GPU memory. Moreover, these approaches fall short in temporal reasoning, merely aggregating frame-level predictions over a temporal context. In response, we introduce DIFFVSGG, an online VSGG solution that frames this task as an iterative scene graph update problem. Drawing inspiration from Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) which generate images via denoising a latent feature embedding, we unify the decoding of object classification, bounding box regression, and graph generation three tasks using one shared feature embedding. Then, given an embedding containing unified features of object pairs, we conduct a step-wise Denoising on it within LDMs, so as to deliver a clean embedding which clearly indicates the relationships between objects. This embedding then serves as the input to task-specific heads for object classification, scene graph generation, etc. DIFFVSGG further facilitates continuous temporal reasoning, where predictions for subsequent frames leverage results of past frames as the conditional inputs of LDMs, to guide the reverse diffusion process for current frames. Extensive experiments on three setups of Action Genome demonstrate the superiority of DIFFVSGG.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Code: https://github.com/kagawa588/DiffVsgg</p></details> |

Current research focuses on prompt- or image-level adversarial attacks for anti-customization, yet it overlooks the correlation between these two levels and the relationship between internal modules and inputs. This hinders anti-customization performance in practical threat scenarios. We propose Dual Anti-Diffusion (DADiff), a two-stage adversarial attack targeting diffusion customization, which, for the first time, integrates the adversarial prompt-level attack into the generation process of image-level adversarial examples. In stage 1, we generate prompt-level adversarial vectors to guide the subsequent image-level attack. In stage 2, besides conducting the end-to-end attack on the UNet model, we disrupt its self- and cross-attention modules, aiming to break the correlations between image pixels and align the cross-attention results computed using instance prompts and adversarial prompt vectors within the images. Furthermore, we introduce a local random timestep gradient ensemble strategy, which updates adversarial perturbations by integrating random gradients from multiple segmented timesets. Experimental results on various mainstream facial datasets demonstrate 10%-30% improvements in cross-prompt, keyword mismatch, cross-model, and cross-mechanism anti-customization with DADiff compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep reinforcement learning-based methods have been actively studied and have outperformed traditional rule-based approaches owing to their optimization capabilities. Among these, methods that assume a continuous action space typically rely on a Gaussian distribution assumption, which limits the flexibility of generated actions. Meanwhile, the application of diffusion models to reinforcement learning has advanced, allowing for more flexible action distributions compared with Gaussian distribution-based approaches. In this study, we applied a diffusion-based reinforcement learning approach to social navigation and validated its effectiveness. Furthermore, by leveraging the characteristics of diffusion models, we propose an extension that enables post-training action smoothing and adaptation to static obstacle scenarios not considered during the training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IROS 2025 for possible publication</p></details> |

As Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images operate under all-weather conditions, SAR-based oil spill segmentation enables fast and robust monitoring. However, when using deep learning models, SAR oil spill segmentation often struggles in training due to the scarcity of labeled data. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation with knowledge transfer (DAKTer) strategy. Our DAKTer strategy enables a diffusion model to generate SAR oil spill images along with soft label pairs, which offer richer class probability distributions than segmentation masks (i.e. hard labels). Also, for reliable joint generation of high-quality SAR images and well-aligned soft labels, we introduce an SNR-based balancing factor aligning the noise corruption process of both modalilties in diffusion models. By leveraging the generated SAR images and soft labels, a student segmentation model can learn robust feature representations without teacher models trained for the same task, improving its ability to segment oil spill regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DAKTer strategy effectively transfers the knowledge of per-pixel class probabilities to the student segmentation model to distinguish the oil spill regions from other look-alike regions in the SAR images. Our DAKTer strategy boosts various segmentation models to achieve superior performance with large margins compared to other generative data augmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the inclusion of sensitive information during pre-training poses significant risks. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a promising solution to eliminate sensitive concepts from these models. Despite its potential, existing MU methods face two main challenges: 1) limited generalization, where concept erasure is effective only within the unlearned set, failing to prevent sensitive concept generation from out-of-set prompts; and 2) utility degradation, where removing target concepts significantly impacts the model's overall performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel concept domain correction framework named \textbf{DoCo} (\textbf{Do}main \textbf{Co}rrection). By aligning the output domains of sensitive and anchor concepts through adversarial training, our approach ensures comprehensive unlearning of target concepts. Additionally, we introduce a concept-preserving gradient surgery technique that mitigates conflicting gradient components, thereby preserving the model's utility while unlearning specific concepts. Extensive experiments across various instances, styles, and offensive concepts demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in unlearning targeted concepts with minimal impact on related concepts, outperforming previous approaches even for out-of-distribution prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 camera-ready version</p></details> |

Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025.

| **[Dual Conditional Diffusion Models for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21967v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promising results in sequential recommendation (SR). Existing approaches predominantly rely on implicit conditional diffusion models, which compress user behaviors into a single representation during the forward diffusion process. While effective to some extent, this oversimplification often leads to the loss of sequential and contextual information, which is critical for understanding user behavior. Moreover, explicit information, such as user-item interactions or sequential patterns, remains underutilized, despite its potential to directly guide the recommendation process and improve precision. However, combining implicit and explicit information is non-trivial, as it requires dynamically integrating these complementary signals while avoiding noise and irrelevant patterns within user behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose Dual Conditional Diffusion Models for Sequential Recommendation (DCRec), which effectively integrates implicit and explicit information by embedding dual conditions into both the forward and reverse diffusion processes. This allows the model to retain valuable sequential and contextual information while leveraging explicit user-item interactions to guide the recommendation process. Specifically, we introduce the Dual Conditional Diffusion Transformer (DCDT), which employs a cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate explicit signals throughout the diffusion stages, ensuring contextual understanding and minimizing the influence of irrelevant patterns. This design enables precise and contextually relevant recommendations. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DCRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Swap Joint Diffusion for 2D Long-Form Latent Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05130v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Swap Forward (SaFa), a modality-agnostic and efficient method to generate seamless and coherence long spectrum and panorama through latent swap joint diffusion across multi-views. We first investigate the spectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing joint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent representation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure arises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the spectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view similarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio generation using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length adaptation. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable performance with 2 $\sim$ 20 $\times$ faster speed and greater model generalizability.

However, existing approaches represent motions as dense frame sequences, requiring the model to process redundant or less informative frames. The processing of dense animation frames imposes significant training complexity, especially when learning intricate distributions of large motion datasets even with modern neural architectures. This severely limits the performance of generative motion models for downstream tasks. Inspired by professional animators who mainly focus on sparse keyframes, we propose a novel diffusion framework explicitly designed around sparse and geometrically meaningful keyframes. Our method reduces computation by masking non-keyframes and efficiently interpolating missing frames. We dynamically refine the keyframe mask during inference to prioritize informative frames in later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in text alignment and motion realism, while also effectively maintaining high performance at significantly fewer diffusion steps. We further validate the robustness of our framework by using it as a generative prior and adapting it to different downstream tasks. Source code and pre-trained models will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, previous methods often oversimplify representations for the skeletal joints, temporal frames, and textual words, limiting their ability to fully capture the information within each modality and their interactions. Moreover, when using pre-trained models for downstream tasks, such as editing, they typically require additional efforts, including manual interventions, optimization, or fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce a skeleton-aware latent diffusion (SALAD), a model that explicitly captures the intricate inter-relationships between joints, frames, and words. Furthermore, by leveraging cross-attention maps produced during the generation process, we enable attention-based zero-shot text-driven motion editing using a pre-trained SALAD model, requiring no additional user input beyond text prompts. Our approach significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of text-motion alignment without compromising generation quality, and demonstrates practical versatility by providing diverse editing capabilities beyond generation.

These products often contain a mix of compliant and rigid components, making robotic disassembly a critical step toward achieving scalable recycling processes. Diffusion policy has emerged as a promising approach for learning low-level skills in robotics. To effectively apply diffusion policy to contact-rich tasks, incorporating force as feedback is essential. In this paper, we apply diffusion policy with vision and force in a compliant object prying task. However, when combining low-dimensional contact force with high-dimensional image, the force information may be diluted. To address this issue, we propose a method that effectively integrates force with image data for diffusion policy observations. We validate our approach on a battery prying task that demands high precision and multi-step execution. Our model achieves a 96\% success rate in diverse scenarios, marking a 57\% improvement over the vision-only baseline. Our method also demonstrates zero-shot transfer capability to handle unseen objects and battery types.

Three formulations are considered: (1) Trotterization, (2) variational quantum time evolution (VarQTE), and (3) adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS). These schemes were originally developed for the Hamiltonian simulation of many-body quantum systems. The finite-difference discretized operator of the transport equation is formulated as a Hamiltonian and solved without the need for ancillary qubits. Computations are conducted on a quantum simulator (IBM Qiskit Aer) and an actual quantum hardware (IBM Fez). The former emulates the latter without the noise. The predicted results are compared with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data with infidelities of the order $10^{-5}$. In the quantum simulator, Trotterization is observed to have the lowest infidelity and is suitable for fault-tolerant computation. The AVQDS algorithm requires the lowest gate count and the lowest circuit depth. The VarQTE algorithm is the next best in terms of gate counts, but the number of its optimization variables is directly proportional to the number of qubits. Due to current hardware limitations, Trotterization cannot be implemented, as it has an overwhelming large number of operations. Meanwhile, AVQDS and VarQTE can be executed, but suffer from large errors due to significant hardware noise. These algorithms present a new paradigm for computational transport phenomena on quantum computers.</p></details> |  |

Fine-grained video editing is crucial for enabling precise, object-level modifications while maintaining context and temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce FiVE, a Fine-grained Video Editing Benchmark for evaluating emerging diffusion and rectified flow models. Our benchmark includes 74 real-world videos and 26 generated videos, featuring 6 fine-grained editing types, 420 object-level editing prompt pairs, and their corresponding masks. Additionally, we adapt the latest rectified flow (RF) T2V generation models, Pyramid-Flow and Wan2.1, by introducing FlowEdit, resulting in training-free and inversion-free video editing models Pyramid-Edit and Wan-Edit. We evaluate five diffusion-based and two RF-based editing methods on our FiVE benchmark using 15 metrics, covering background preservation, text-video similarity, temporal consistency, video quality, and runtime. To further enhance object-level evaluation, we introduce FiVE-Acc, a novel metric leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to assess the success of fine-grained video editing. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-based editing significantly outperforms diffusion-based methods, with Wan-Edit achieving the best overall performance and exhibiting the least sensitivity to hyperparameters.

The synthesized videos are evaluated on mainly two aspects, lip-speech synchronization and image fidelity. Recent studies demonstrate that GAN-based and diffusion-based models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on this task, with diffusion-based models achieving superior image fidelity but experiencing lower synchronization compared to their GAN-based counterparts. To this end, we propose SyncDiff, a simple yet effective approach to improve diffusion-based models using a temporal pose frame with information bottleneck and facial-informative audio features extracted from AVHuBERT, as conditioning input into the diffusion process. We evaluate SyncDiff on two canonical talking head datasets, LRS2 and LRS3 for direct comparison with other SOTA models. Experiments on LRS2/LRS3 datasets show that SyncDiff achieves a synchronization score 27.7%/62.3% relatively higher than previous diffusion-based methods, while preserving their high-fidelity characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Tuning Discrete Diffusion Models via Reward Optimization with Applications to DNA and Protein Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13643v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the strong empirical performance of diffusion models on discrete sequences across domains from natural language to biological sequence generation. For example, in the protein inverse folding task, conditional diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating natural-like sequences that fold back into the original structure. However, practical design tasks often require not only modeling a conditional distribution but also optimizing specific task objectives. For instance, we may prefer protein sequences with high stability. To address this, we consider the scenario where we have pre-trained discrete diffusion models that can generate natural-like sequences, as well as reward models that map sequences to task objectives. We then formulate the reward maximization problem within discrete diffusion models, analogous to reinforcement learning (RL), while minimizing the KL divergence against pretrained diffusion models to preserve naturalness. To solve this RL problem, we propose a novel algorithm, DRAKES, that enables direct backpropagation of rewards through entire trajectories generated by diffusion models, by making the originally non-differentiable trajectories differentiable using the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our theoretical analysis indicates that our approach can generate sequences that are both natural-like and yield high rewards. While similar tasks have been recently explored in diffusion models for continuous domains, our work addresses unique algorithmic and theoretical challenges specific to discrete diffusion models, which arise from their foundation in continuous-time Markov chains rather than Brownian motion. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRAKES in generating DNA and protein sequences that optimize enhancer activity and protein stability, respectively, important tasks for gene therapies and protein-based therapeutics.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Despite the development of several methods to accelerate diffusion-based SR models, some (e.g., SinSR) fail to produce realistic perceptual details, while others (e.g., OSEDiff) may hallucinate non-existent structures. To overcome these issues, we present RSD, a new distillation method for ResShift, one of the top diffusion-based SR models. Our method is based on training the student network to produce such images that a new fake ResShift model trained on them will coincide with the teacher model. RSD achieves single-step restoration and outperforms the teacher by a large margin. We show that our distillation method can surpass the other distillation-based method for ResShift - SinSR - making it on par with state-of-the-art diffusion-based SR distillation methods. Compared to SR methods based on pre-trained text-to-image models, RSD produces competitive perceptual quality, provides images with better alignment to degraded input images, and requires fewer parameters and GPU memory. We provide experimental results on various real-world and synthetic datasets, including RealSR, RealSet65, DRealSR, ImageNet, and DIV2K.</p></details> |  |

Video diffusion models generate impressive videos but cannot directly synthesize 3D representations, i.e., lack 3D consistency in the generated sequences. In addition, directly training generative 3D models is challenging due to a lack of 3D training data at scale. In this work, we present Generative Gaussian Splatting (GGS) -- a novel approach that integrates a 3D representation with a pre-trained latent video diffusion model. Specifically, our model synthesizes a feature field parameterized via 3D Gaussian primitives. The feature field is then either rendered to feature maps and decoded into multi-view images, or directly upsampled into a 3D radiance field. We evaluate our approach on two common benchmark datasets for scene synthesis, RealEstate10K and ScanNet+, and find that our proposed GGS model significantly improves both the 3D consistency of the generated multi-view images, and the quality of the generated 3D scenes over all relevant baselines. Compared to a similar model without 3D representation, GGS improves FID on the generated 3D scenes by ~20% on both RealEstate10K and ScanNet+.

Previous systems have primarily focused on the weak correlation between audio and gestures, leading to physically unnatural outcomes that degrade the user experience. To address this problem, we introduce HoleGest, a novel neural network framework based on decoupled diffusion and motion priors for the automatic generation of high-quality, expressive co-speech gestures. Our system leverages large-scale human motion datasets to learn a robust prior with low audio dependency and high motion reliance, enabling stable global motion and detailed finger movements. To improve the generation efficiency of diffusion-based models, we integrate implicit joint constraints with explicit geometric and conditional constraints, capturing complex motion distributions between large strides. This integration significantly enhances generation speed while maintaining high-quality motion. Furthermore, we design a shared embedding space for gesture-transcription text alignment, enabling the generation of semantically correct gesture actions. Extensive experiments and user feedback demonstrate the effectiveness and potential applications of our model, with our method achieving a level of realism close to the ground truth, providing an immersive user experience.

However, their applications are constrained by the limited availability of data and the reluctance of medical centers to share it due to patient privacy concerns. Generative models present a promising solution by creating synthetic data as a substitute for real patient data. However, medical images are typically high-dimensional, and current state-of-the-art methods are often impractical for computational resource-constrained healthcare environments. These models rely on data sub-sampling, raising doubts about their feasibility and real-world applicability. Furthermore, many of these models are evaluated on quantitative metrics that alone can be misleading in assessing the image quality and clinical meaningfulness of the generated images. To address this, we introduce MedLoRD, a generative diffusion model designed for computational resource-constrained environments. MedLoRD is capable of generating high-dimensional medical volumes with resolutions up to 512$\times$512$\times$256, utilizing GPUs with only 24GB VRAM, which are commonly found in standard desktop workstations. MedLoRD is evaluated across multiple modalities, including Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography and Lung Computed Tomography datasets. Extensive evaluations through radiological evaluation, relative regional volume analysis, adherence to conditional masks, and downstream tasks show that MedLoRD generates high-fidelity images closely adhering to segmentation mask conditions, surpassing the capabilities of current state-of-the-art generative models for medical image synthesis in computational resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

Yet their widespread adoption poses challenges regarding data attribution and interpretability. In this paper, we aim to help address such challenges in diffusion models by developing an influence functions framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning.

Recent work on image diffusion highlights the strong capabilities of Mamba (state space models) due to its efficient handling of long-range dependencies and sequential data modeling. Unfortunately, joint consideration of state space models with 3D point cloud generation remains limited. To harness the powerful capabilities of the Mamba model for 3D point cloud generation, we propose a novel diffusion framework containing dual latent Mamba block (DM-Block) and a time-variant frequency encoder (TF-Encoder). The DM-Block apply a space-filling curve to reorder points into sequences suitable for Mamba state-space modeling, while operating in a latent space to mitigate the computational overhead that arises from direct 3D data processing. Meanwhile, the TF-Encoder takes advantage of the ability of the diffusion model to refine fine details in later recovery stages by prioritizing key points within the U-Net architecture. This frequency-based mechanism ensures enhanced detail quality in the final stages of generation.

| **[Unlock Pose Diversity: Accurate and Efficient Implicit Keypoint-based Spatiotemporal Diffusion for Audio-driven Talking Portrait](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12963v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven single-image talking portrait generation plays a crucial role in virtual reality, digital human creation, and filmmaking. Existing approaches are generally categorized into keypoint-based and image-based methods. Keypoint-based methods effectively preserve character identity but struggle to capture fine facial details due to the fixed points limitation of the 3D Morphable Model. Moreover, traditional generative networks face challenges in establishing causality between audio and keypoints on limited datasets, resulting in low pose diversity. In contrast, image-based approaches produce high-quality portraits with diverse details using the diffusion network but incur identity distortion and expensive computational costs. In this work, we propose KDTalker, the first framework to combine unsupervised implicit 3D keypoint with a spatiotemporal diffusion model. Leveraging unsupervised implicit 3D keypoints, KDTalker adapts facial information densities, allowing the diffusion process to model diverse head poses and capture fine facial details flexibly. The custom-designed spatiotemporal attention mechanism ensures accurate lip synchronization, producing temporally consistent, high-quality animations while enhancing computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that KDTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance regarding lip synchronization accuracy, head pose diversity, and execution efficiency.Our codes are available at https://github.com/chaolongy/KDTalker.</p></details> |  |

Although existing autoregressive VLA methods leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they disrupt the continuity of actions. Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on VLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single large language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the generation gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the diffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe, we find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these two predictions, leading to more robust control. In experiments, HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods across various simulation and real-world tasks, including both single-arm and dual-arm robots, while demonstrating stable manipulation in previously unseen configurations.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements in 3D generative models, existing methods still face challenges with optimization speed, geometric fidelity, and the lack of assets for physically based rendering (PBR). In this paper, we introduce 3DTopia-XL, a scalable native 3D generative model designed to overcome these limitations. 3DTopia-XL leverages a novel primitive-based 3D representation, PrimX, which encodes detailed shape, albedo, and material field into a compact tensorial format, facilitating the modeling of high-resolution geometry with PBR assets. On top of the novel representation, we propose a generative framework based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT), which comprises 1) Primitive Patch Compression, 2) and Latent Primitive Diffusion. 3DTopia-XL learns to generate high-quality 3D assets from textual or visual inputs. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that 3DTopia-XL significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality 3D assets with fine-grained textures and materials, efficiently bridging the quality gap between generative models and real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Code https://github.com/3DTopia/3DTopia-XL Project Page https://3dtopia.github.io/3DTopia-XL/</p></details> |

Current methods fall short in reliably identifying unauthorized image use, as they struggle to generalize across varied generation tasks and fail when the training dataset includes images from multiple sources with few identifiable (watermarked or poisoned) samples. In this paper, we present novel evidence that diffusion-generated images faithfully preserve the statistical properties of their training data, particularly reflected in their spectral features. Leveraging this insight, we introduce \emph{CoprGuard}, a robust frequency domain watermarking framework to safeguard against unauthorized image usage in diffusion model training and fine-tuning. CoprGuard demonstrates remarkable effectiveness against a wide range of models, from naive diffusion models to sophisticated text-to-image models, and is robust even when watermarked images comprise a mere 1\% of the training dataset. This robust and versatile approach empowers content owners to protect their intellectual property in the era of AI-driven image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Recei...</summary><p>Received by CVPR 2025 (10 pages, 11 figures)</p></details> |

To enable more flexible image manipulation and editing, recent research has expanded from single image generation to transparent layer generation and multi-layer compositions. However, existing approaches often fail to provide a thorough exploration of multi-layer structures, leading to inconsistent inter-layer interactions, such as occlusion relationships, spatial layout, and shadowing. In this paper, we introduce DreamLayer, a novel framework that enables coherent text-driven generation of multiple image layers, by explicitly modeling the relationship between transparent foreground and background layers. DreamLayer incorporates three key components, i.e., Context-Aware Cross-Attention (CACA) for global-local information exchange, Layer-Shared Self-Attention (LSSA) for establishing robust inter-layer connections, and Information Retained Harmonization (IRH) for refining fusion details at the latent level. By leveraging a coherent full-image context, DreamLayer builds inter-layer connections through attention mechanisms and applies a harmonization step to achieve seamless layer fusion. To facilitate research in multi-layer generation, we construct a high-quality, diverse multi-layer dataset including 400k samples. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that DreamLayer generates more coherent and well-aligned layers, with broad applicability, including latent-space image editing and image-to-layer decomposition.</p></details> | Under submission |

To address these challenges, we propose a single-view RGB-D-based depth completion framework, TransDiff, that leverages the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models(DDPM) to achieve material-agnostic object grasping in desktop. Specifically, we leverage features extracted from RGB images, including semantic segmentation, edge maps, and normal maps, to condition the depth map generation process. Our method learns an iterative denoising process that transforms a random depth distribution into a depth map, guided by initially refined depth information, ensuring more accurate depth estimation in scenarios involving transparent objects. Additionally, we propose a novel training method to better align the noisy depth and RGB image features, which are used as conditions to refine depth estimation step by step. Finally, we utilized an improved inference process to accelerate the denoising procedure. Through comprehensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks with acceptable inference time.

Two fundamental limitations hinder current approaches: (1) the lack of a comprehensive suction grasp dataset tailored for parcel manipulation tasks, and (2) insufficient adaptability to diverse object characteristics including size variations, geometric complexity, and textural diversity. To address these challenges, we present Parcel-Suction-Dataset, a large-scale synthetic dataset containing 25 thousand cluttered scenes with 410 million precision-annotated suction grasp poses. This dataset is generated through our novel geometric sampling algorithm that enables efficient generation of optimal suction grasps incorporating both physical constraints and material properties. We further propose Diffusion-Suction, an innovative framework that reformulates suction grasp prediction as a conditional generation task through denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our method iteratively refines random noise into suction grasp score maps through visual-conditioned guidance from point cloud observations, effectively learning spatial point-wise affordances from our synthetic dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the simple yet efficient Diffusion-Suction achieves new state-of-the-art performance compared to previous models on both Parcel-Suction-Dataset and the public SuctionNet-1Billion benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Angiographic images can effectively assist in the diagnosis of vascular diseases. However, contrast agents may bring extra radiation exposure which is harmful to patients with health risks. To mitigate these concerns, in this paper, we aim to automatically generate angiography from non-angiographic inputs, by leveraging and enhancing the inherent physical properties of vascular structures. Previous methods relying on 2D slice-based angiography synthesis struggle with maintaining continuity in 3D vascular structures and exhibit limited effectiveness across different imaging modalities. We propose VasTSD, a 3D vascular tree-state space diffusion model to synthesize angiography from 3D non-angiographic volumes, with a novel state space serialization approach that dynamically constructs vascular tree topologies, integrating these with a diffusion-based generative model to ensure the generation of anatomically continuous vasculature in 3D volumes. A pre-trained vision embedder is employed to construct vascular state space representations, enabling consistent modeling of vascular structures across multiple modalities. Extensive experiments on various angiographic datasets demonstrate the superiority of VasTSD over prior works, achieving enhanced continuity of blood vessels in synthesized angiographic synthesis for multiple modalities and anatomical regions.</p></details> |  |

In order to improve the performance of this model, we develop a novel decoder module: Spiking Modulate De coder (SMD), which replaces the traditional Decoder module within the Transformer architecture. Additionally, we explored the substitution of DDPM with Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) in our frame work. We conducted experiments across four robotic manipulation tasks and performed ablation studies on the modulate block. Our model consistently outperforms existing Transformer-based diffusion policy method. Especially in Can task, we achieved an improvement of 8%.

By combining diffusion models with BC, diffusion policiy has been proposed, enabling robots to quickly learn manipulation tasks with high success rates. However, integrating diffusion policy with high-capacity Transformer presents challenges, traditional Transformer architectures struggle to effectively integrate guiding conditions, resulting in poor performance in manipulation tasks when using Transformer-based models. In this paper, we investigate key architectural designs of Transformers and improve the traditional Transformer architecture by proposing the Modulated Transformer Diffusion Policy (MTDP) model for diffusion policy. The core of this model is the Modulated Attention module we proposed, which more effectively integrates the guiding conditions with the main input, improving the generative model's output quality and, consequently, increasing the robot's task success rate. In six experimental tasks, MTDP outperformed existing Transformer model architectures, particularly in the Toolhang experiment, where the success rate increased by 12\%. To verify the generality of Modulated Attention, we applied it to the UNet architecture to construct Modulated UNet Diffusion Policy model (MUDP), which also achieved higher success rates than existing UNet architectures across all six experiments. The Diffusion Policy uses Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) as the diffusion model. Building on this, we also explored Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) as the diffusion model, constructing the MTDP-I and MUDP-I model, which nearly doubled the generation speed while maintaining performance.</p></details> |  |

Typically for 2D games, illustrators begin by designing the main character image, which serves as the foundation for all subsequent animations. To create a smooth motion sequence, these subsequent animations involve drawing the character in different poses and actions, such as running, jumping, or attacking. This process requires significant manual effort from illustrators, as they must meticulously ensure consistency in design, proportions, and style across multiple motion frames. Each frame is drawn individually, making this a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Generative models, such as diffusion models, have the potential to revolutionize this process by automating the creation of sprite sheets. Diffusion models, known for their ability to generate diverse images, can be adapted to create character animations. By leveraging the capabilities of diffusion models, we can significantly reduce the manual workload for illustrators, accelerate the animation creation process, and open up new creative possibilities in game development.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://chenganhsieh.github.io/spritesheet-diffusion/</p></details> |

Building on this, various methods further fine-tune the pre-trained T2I model for specific tasks. However, this requires separate model architectures, training designs, and multiple parameter sets to handle different tasks. In this paper, we introduce UniVG, a generalist diffusion model capable of supporting a diverse range of image generation tasks with a single set of weights. UniVG treats multi-modal inputs as unified conditions to enable various downstream applications, ranging from T2I generation, inpainting, instruction-based editing, identity-preserving generation, and layout-guided generation, to depth estimation and referring segmentation. Through comprehensive empirical studies on data mixing and multi-task training, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs. For example, we show that T2I generation and other tasks, such as instruction-based editing, can coexist without performance trade-offs, while auxiliary tasks like depth estimation and referring segmentation enhance image editing. Notably, our model can even outperform some task-specific models on their respective benchmarks, marking a significant step towards a unified image generation model.</p></details> |  |

However, consistent generation of high-quality images remains challenging partly due to the lack of conditioning mechanisms for perceptual quality. In this work, we propose methods to integrate image quality assessment (IQA) models into diffusion-based generators, enabling quality-aware image generation. We show that diffusion models can learn complex qualitative relationships from both IQA models' outputs and internal activations. First, we experiment with gradient-based guidance to optimize image quality directly and show this method has limited generalizability. To address this, we introduce IQA-Adapter, a novel framework that conditions generation on target quality levels by learning the implicit relationship between images and quality scores. When conditioned on high target quality, IQA-Adapter can shift the distribution of generated images towards a higher-quality subdomain, and, inversely, it can be used as a degradation model, generating progressively more distorted images when provided with a lower-quality signal. Under high-quality condition, IQA-Adapter achieves up to a 10% improvement across multiple objective metrics, as confirmed by a user preference study, while preserving generative diversity and content. Furthermore, we extend IQA-Adapter to a reference-based conditioning scenario, utilizing the rich activation space of IQA models to transfer highly specific, content-agnostic qualitative features between images.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub repo: https://github.com/X1716/IQA-Adapter</p></details> |
| **[How compositional generalization and creativity improve as diffusion models are trained](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12089v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural data is often organized as a hierarchical composition of features. How many samples do generative models need in order to learn the composition rules, so as to produce a combinatorially large number of novel data? What signal in the data is exploited to learn those rules? We investigate these questions in the context of diffusion models both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we consider simple probabilistic context-free grammars - tree-like graphical models used to represent the hierarchical and compositional structure of data such as language and images. We demonstrate that diffusion models learn the grammar's composition rules with the sample complexity required for clustering features with statistically similar context, a process similar to the word2vec algorithm. However, this clustering emerges hierarchically: higher-level features associated with longer contexts require more data to be identified. This mechanism leads to a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the said context size. As a result, diffusion models trained on an intermediate dataset size generate data coherent up to a certain scale, but that lacks global coherence. We test these predictions in different domains, and find remarkable agreement: both generated texts and images achieve progressively larger coherence lengths as the training time or dataset size grows. We discuss connections between the hierarchical clustering mechanism we introduce here and the renormalization group in physics.</p></details> |  |

Given a set of text prompts, we aim to generate a collection of objects with semantically corresponding parts aligned across them. Recent methods based on Score Distillation have succeeded in distilling the knowledge from 2D diffusion models to high-quality representations of the 3D objects. These methods handle multiple text queries separately, and therefore the resulting objects have a high variability in object pose and structure. However, in some applications, such as 3D asset design, it may be desirable to obtain a set of objects aligned with each other. In order to achieve the alignment of the corresponding parts of the generated objects, we propose to embed these objects into a common latent space and optimize the continuous transitions between these objects. We enforce two kinds of properties of these transitions: smoothness of the transition and plausibility of the intermediate objects along the transition. We demonstrate that both of these properties are essential for good alignment. We provide several practical scenarios that benefit from alignment between the objects, including 3D editing and object hybridization, and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. https://voyleg.github.io/a3d/</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a cognition-decision framework that integrates individual variability and commonalities in driver behavior to quantify risk cognition and model dynamic decision-making. First, a risk sensitivity model based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution is developed to characterize individual differences in risk cognition. Then, a cognitive decision-making model based on the drift diffusion model (DDM) is introduced to capture common decision-making mechanisms in high-risk environments. The DDM dynamically adjusts decision thresholds by integrating initial bias, drift rate, and boundary parameters, adapting to variations in speed, relative distance, and risk sensitivity to reflect diverse driving styles and risk preferences. By simulating high-risk scenarios with lateral, longitudinal, and multidimensional risk sources in a driving simulator, the proposed model accurately predicts cognitive responses and decision behaviors during emergency maneuvers. Specifically, by incorporating driver-specific risk sensitivity, the model enables dynamic adjustments of key DDM parameters, allowing for personalized decision-making representations in diverse scenarios. Comparative analysis with IDM, Gipps, and MOBIL demonstrates that DDM more precisely captures human cognitive processes and adaptive decision-making in high-risk scenarios. These findings provide a theoretical basis for modeling human driving behavior and offer critical insights for enhancing AV-human interaction in real-world traffic environments.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Recent training-free approaches, while exhibit higher computational efficiency than training-based methods, struggle with identity preservation, applicability, and compatibility with diffusion transformers (DiTs).

This simple yet effective feature injection technique unlocks diverse scenarios, from personalization to image editing. Building upon this observation, we propose \textbf{Personalize Anything}, a training-free framework that achieves personalized image generation in DiT through: 1) timestep-adaptive token replacement that enforces subject consistency via early-stage injection and enhances flexibility through late-stage regularization, and 2) patch perturbation strategies to boost structural diversity.

Although existing methods have shown great performance in generating entire graphs for graph-level learning tasks, no graph diffusion models have been developed to generate synthetic graph structures, that is, synthetic nodes and associated edges within a given graph, for node-level learning tasks. Inspired by the research in the computer vision literature using synthetic data for enhanced performance, we propose Diffusion on Graph (DoG), which generates synthetic graph structures to boost the performance of GNNs. The synthetic graph structures generated by DoG are combined with the original graph to form an augmented graph for the training of node-level learning tasks, such as node classification and graph contrastive learning (GCL). To improve the efficiency of the generation process, a Bi-Level Neighbor Map Decoder (BLND) is introduced in DoG. To mitigate the adverse effect of the noise introduced by the synthetic graph structures, a low-rank regularization method is proposed for the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) on the augmented graphs. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets for semi-supervised node classification and graph contrastive learning have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of DoG with low-rank regularization.

However, since these models are data-driven, they inherit biases from the training datasets, frequently leading to disproportionate group representations that exacerbate societal inequities. Traditionally, efforts to debiase these models have relied on predefined sensitive attributes, classifiers trained on such attributes, or large language models to steer outputs toward fairness. However, these approaches face notable drawbacks: predefined attributes do not adequately capture complex and continuous variations among groups. To address these issues, we introduce the Debiasing Diffusion Model (DDM), which leverages an indicator to learn latent representations during training, promoting fairness through balanced representations without requiring predefined sensitive attributes. This approach not only demonstrates its effectiveness in scenarios previously addressed by conventional techniques but also enhances fairness without relying on predefined sensitive attributes as conditions. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of prior bias mitigation techniques in diffusion-based models, elaborate on the architecture of the DDM, and validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion prior, learned from training on a large collection of natural images, and the features present in the model itself to guide the inference, in contrast to existing methods that depend on customized constraints. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms SOTA methods on established datasets, while qualitative analyses indicate enhanced color accuracy and the rectification of subtle chromatic deviations. Furthermore, additional experiments reveal that our method, without any modifications, achieves SOTA-comparable performance in the auto white balance (AWB) task.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method, termed PLADIS, which boosts pre-trained models (U-Net/Transformer) by leveraging sparse attention. Specifically, we extrapolate query-key correlations using softmax and its sparse counterpart in the cross-attention layer during inference, without requiring extra training or NFEs. By leveraging the noise robustness of sparse attention, our PLADIS unleashes the latent potential of text-to-image diffusion models, enabling them to excel in areas where they once struggled with newfound effectiveness. It integrates seamlessly with guidance techniques, including guidance-distilled models. Extensive experiments show notable improvements in text alignment and human preference, offering a highly efficient and universally applicable solution.

| **[Adaptive AUV Hunting Policy with Covert Communication via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13547v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative underwater target hunting, facilitated by multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), plays a significant role in various domains, especially military missions. Existing research predominantly focuses on designing efficient and high-success-rate hunting policy, particularly addressing the target's evasion capabilities. However, in real-world scenarios, the target can not only adjust its evasion policy based on its observations and predictions but also possess eavesdropping capabilities. If communication among hunter AUVs, such as hunting policy exchanges, is intercepted by the target, it can adapt its escape policy accordingly, significantly reducing the success rate of the hunting mission. To address this challenge, we propose a covert communication-guaranteed collaborative target hunting framework, which ensures efficient hunting in complex underwater environments while defending against the target's eavesdropping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate the confidentiality of inter-agent communication into the design of target hunting policy. Furthermore, given the complexity of coordinating multiple AUVs in dynamic and unpredictable environments, we propose an adaptive multi-agent diffusion policy (AMADP), which incorporates the strong generative ability of diffusion models into the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that AMADP achieves faster convergence and higher hunting success rates while maintaining covertness constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 1 tables, Published at ICC 2025</p></details> |
| **[GravMAD: Grounded Spatial Value Maps Guided Action Diffusion for Generalized 3D Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20154v7)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots' ability to follow language instructions and execute diverse 3D manipulation tasks is vital in robot learning. Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing GravMAD with more flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. Evaluations on real-world robotic tasks further show that GravMAD can reason about real-world tasks, associate them with relevant visual information, and generalize to novel tasks. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation. Video demonstrations are available at: https://gravmad.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025. The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[SING: Semantic Image Communications using Null-Space and INN-Guided Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12484v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint source-channel coding systems based on deep neural networks (DeepJSCC) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in wireless image transmission. Existing methods primarily focus on minimizing distortion between the transmitted image and the reconstructed version at the receiver, often overlooking perceptual quality. This can lead to severe perceptual degradation when transmitting images under extreme conditions, such as low bandwidth compression ratios (BCRs) and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this work, we propose SING, a novel two-stage JSCC framework that formulates the recovery of high-quality source images from corrupted reconstructions as an inverse problem. Depending on the availability of information about the DeepJSCC encoder/decoder and the channel at the receiver, SING can either approximate the stochastic degradation as a linear transformation, or leverage invertible neural networks (INNs) for precise modeling. Both approaches enable the seamless integration of diffusion models into the reconstruction process, enhancing perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate that SING outperforms DeepJSCC and other approaches, delivering superior perceptual quality even under extremely challenging conditions, including scenarios with significant distribution mismatches between the training and test data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Synthetic Data Generation for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12472v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of models is intricately linked to the abundance of training data. In Visible-Infrared person Re-IDentification (VI-ReID) tasks, collecting and annotating large-scale images of each individual under various cameras and modalities is tedious, time-expensive, costly and must comply with data protection laws, posing a severe challenge in meeting dataset requirements. Current research investigates the generation of synthetic data as an efficient and privacy-ensuring alternative to collecting real data in the field. However, a specific data synthesis technique tailored for VI-ReID models has yet to be explored. In this paper, we present a novel data generation framework, dubbed Diffusion-based VI-ReID data Expansion (DiVE), that automatically obtain massive RGB-IR paired images with identity preserving by decoupling identity and modality to improve the performance of VI-ReID models. Specifically, identity representation is acquired from a set of samples sharing the same ID, whereas the modality of images is learned by fine-tuning the Stable Diffusion (SD) on modality-specific data. DiVE extend the text-driven image synthesis to identity-preserving RGB-IR multimodal image synthesis. This approach significantly reduces data collection and annotation costs by directly incorporating synthetic data into ReID model training. Experiments have demonstrated that VI-ReID models trained on synthetic data produced by DiVE consistently exhibit notable enhancements. In particular, the state-of-the-art method, CAJ, trained with synthetic images, achieves an improvement of about $9\%$ in mAP over the baseline on the LLCM dataset.

| **[Modality-Composable Diffusion Policy via Inference-Time Distribution-level Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12466v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policy (DP) has attracted significant attention as an effective method for policy representation due to its capacity to model multi-distribution dynamics. However, current DPs are often based on a single visual modality (e.g., RGB or point cloud), limiting their accuracy and generalization potential. Although training a generalized DP capable of handling heterogeneous multimodal data would enhance performance, it entails substantial computational and data-related costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel policy composition method: by leveraging multiple pre-trained DPs based on individual visual modalities, we can combine their distributional scores to form a more expressive Modality-Composable Diffusion Policy (MCDP), without the need for additional training. Through extensive empirical experiments on the RoboTwin dataset, we demonstrate the potential of MCDP to improve both adaptability and performance. This exploration aims to provide valuable insights into the flexible composition of existing DPs, facilitating the development of generalizable cross-modality, cross-domain, and even cross-embodiment policies.

| **[Glauber Generative Model: Discrete Diffusion Models via Binary Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17035v4)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Glauber Generative Model (GGM), a new class of discrete diffusion models, to obtain new samples from a distribution given samples from a discrete space. GGM deploys a discrete Markov chain called the heat bath dynamics (or the Glauber dynamics) to denoise a sequence of noisy tokens to a sample from a joint distribution of discrete tokens. Our novel conceptual framework provides an exact reduction of the task of learning the denoising Markov chain to solving a class of binary classification tasks. More specifically, the model learns to classify a given token in a noisy sequence as signal or noise. In contrast, prior works on discrete diffusion models either solve regression problems to learn importance ratios, or minimize loss functions given by variational approximations. We apply GGM to language modeling and image generation, where images are discretized using image tokenizers like VQGANs. We show that it outperforms existing discrete diffusion models in language generation, and demonstrates strong performance for image generation without using dataset-specific image tokenizers. We also show that our model is capable of performing well in zero-shot control settings like text and image infilling.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Co-learning Single-Step Diffusion Upsampler and Downsampler with Two Discriminators and Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07663v4)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts, often relying on effective downsampling to generate diverse and realistic training pairs. In this work, we propose a co-learning framework that jointly optimizes a single-step diffusion-based upsampler and a learnable downsampler, enhanced by two discriminators and a cyclic distillation strategy. Our learnable downsampler is designed to better capture realistic degradation patterns while preserving structural details in the LR domain, which is crucial for enhancing SR performance. By leveraging a diffusion-based approach, our model generates diverse LR-HR pairs during training, enabling robust learning across varying degradations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both general real-world and domain-specific face SR tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Our approach not only improves efficiency with a single inference step but also ensures high-quality image reconstruction, bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world SR scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Diffusion-based Inverse Algorithms under Few-Step Constraint via Learnable Linear Extrapolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10103v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in modeling complex data priors, catalyzing their widespread adoption in solving various inverse problems. However, the inherently iterative nature of diffusion-based inverse algorithms often requires hundreds to thousands of steps, with performance degradation occurring under fewer steps which limits their practical applicability. While high-order diffusion ODE solvers have been extensively explored for efficient diffusion sampling without observations, their application to inverse problems remains underexplored due to the diverse forms of inverse algorithms and their need for repeated trajectory correction based on observations. To address this gap, we first introduce a canonical form that decomposes existing diffusion-based inverse algorithms into three modules to unify their analysis. Inspired by the linear subspace search strategy in the design of high-order diffusion ODE solvers, we propose the Learnable Linear Extrapolation (LLE) method, a lightweight approach that universally enhances the performance of any diffusion-based inverse algorithm that fits the proposed canonical form. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements of the proposed LLE method across multiple algorithms and tasks, indicating its potential for more efficient solutions and boosted performance of diffusion-based inverse algorithms with limited steps. Codes for reproducing our experiments are available at https://github.com/weigerzan/LLE_inverse_problem.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[TextDiff: Mask-Guided Residual Diffusion Models for Scene Text Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06743v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of scene text image super-resolution is to reconstruct high-resolution text-line images from unrecognizable low-resolution inputs. The existing methods relying on the optimization of pixel-level loss tend to yield text edges that exhibit a notable degree of blurring, thereby exerting a substantial impact on both the readability and recognizability of the text. To address these issues, we propose TextDiff, the first diffusion-based framework tailored for scene text image super-resolution. It contains two modules: the Text Enhancement Module (TEM) and the Mask-Guided Residual Diffusion Module (MRD). The TEM generates an initial deblurred text image and a mask that encodes the spatial location of the text. The MRD is responsible for effectively sharpening the text edge by modeling the residuals between the ground-truth images and the initial deblurred images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TextDiff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on public benchmark datasets and can improve the readability of scene text images. Moreover, our proposed MRD module is plug-and-play that effectively sharpens the text edges produced by SOTA methods. This enhancement not only improves the readability and recognizability of the results generated by SOTA methods but also does not require any additional joint training.

To address these issues, we propose MExD, an Expert-Infused Diffusion Model that combines the strengths of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with a diffusion model for enhanced classification. MExD balances patch feature distribution through a novel MoE-based aggregator that selectively emphasizes relevant information, effectively filtering noise, addressing data imbalance, and extracting essential features. These features are then integrated via a diffusion-based generative process to directly yield the class distribution for the WSI. Moving beyond conventional discriminative approaches, MExD represents the first generative strategy in WSI classification, capturing fine-grained details for robust and precise results. Our MExD is validated on three widely-used benchmarks-Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and BRACS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in both binary and multi-class tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[Localized Concept Erasure for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using Training-Free Gated Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12356v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning based concept erasing has demonstrated promising results in preventing generation of harmful contents from text-to-image diffusion models by removing target concepts while preserving remaining concepts. To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[MDiff-FMT: Morphology-aware Diffusion Model for Fluorescence Molecular Tomography with Small-scale Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06757v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) is a sensitive optical imaging technology widely used in biomedical research. However, the ill-posedness of the inverse problem poses a huge challenge to FMT reconstruction. Although end-to-end deep learning algorithms have been widely used to address this critical issue, they still suffer from high data dependency and poor morphological restoration. In this paper, we report for the first time a morphology-aware diffusion model, MDiff-FMT, based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to achieve high-fidelity morphological reconstruction for FMT. First, we use the noise addition of DDPM to simulate the process of the gradual degradation of morphological features, and achieve fine-grained reconstruction of morphological features through a stepwise probabilistic sampling mechanism, avoiding problems such as loss of structure details that may occur in end-to-end deep learning methods. Additionally, we introduce the conditional fluorescence image as structural prior information to sample a high-fidelity reconstructed image from the noisy images. Numerous numerical and real phantom experimental results show that the proposed MDiff-FMT achieves SOTA results in morphological reconstruction of FMT without relying on large-scale datasets.</p></details> |  |

Unlike DL-Polycube methods that rely on predefined polycube structure templates, DDPM-Polycube models the deformation from input geometry to its corresponding polycube structures as a denoising task. By learning the deformation characteristics of simple geometric primitives (a cube and a cube with a hole), the DDPM-Polycube model progressively reconstructs polycube structures from input geometry by removing non-standard Gaussian noise. Once valid polycube structures are generated, they are used for surface segmentation and parametric mapping to generate high-quality hex meshes. Truncated hierarchical B-splines are then applied to construct volumetric splines that satisfy the requirements of isogeometric analysis (IGA). Experimental results demonstrate that DDPM-Polycube model can directly generate polycube structures from input geometries, even when the topology of these geometries falls outside its trained range. This provides greater generalization and adaptability for diverse engineering geometries. Overall, this research shows the potential of diffusion models in advancing mesh generation and IGA applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Lan-o3dp, a language-guided object-centric diffusion policy framework that can adapt to unseen situations such as cluttered scenes, shifting camera views, and ambiguous similar objects while offering training-free collision avoidance and achieving a high success rate with few demonstrations. We train a diffusion model conditioned on 3D point clouds of task-relevant objects to predict the robot's end-effector trajectories, enabling it to complete the tasks. During inference, we incorporate cost optimization into denoising steps to guide the generated trajectory to be collision-free. We leverage open-set segmentation to obtain the 3D point clouds of related objects. We use a large language model to identify the target objects and possible obstacles by interpreting the user's natural language instructions. To effectively guide the conditional diffusion model using a time-independent cost function, we proposed a novel guided generation mechanism based on the estimated clean trajectories. In the simulation, we showed that diffusion policy based on the object-centric 3D representation achieves a much higher success rate (68.7%) compared to baselines with simple 2D (39.3%) and 3D scene (43.6%) representations across 21 challenging RLBench tasks with only 40 demonstrations. In real-world experiments, we extensively evaluated the generalization in various unseen situations and validated the effectiveness of the proposed zero-shot cost-guided collision avoidance.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Reflect-DiT: Inference-Time Scaling for Text-to-Image Diffusion Transformers via In-Context Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12271v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The predominant approach to advancing text-to-image generation has been training-time scaling, where larger models are trained on more data using greater computational resources. While effective, this approach is computationally expensive, leading to growing interest in inference-time scaling to improve performance. Currently, inference-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models is largely limited to best-of-N sampling, where multiple images are generated per prompt and a selection model chooses the best output. Inspired by the recent success of reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 in the language domain, we introduce an alternative to naive best-of-N sampling by equipping text-to-image Diffusion Transformers with in-context reflection capabilities. We propose Reflect-DiT, a method that enables Diffusion Transformers to refine their generations using in-context examples of previously generated images alongside textual feedback describing necessary improvements. Instead of passively relying on random sampling and hoping for a better result in a future generation, Reflect-DiT explicitly tailors its generations to address specific aspects requiring enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that Reflect-DiT improves performance on the GenEval benchmark (+0.19) using SANA-1.0-1.6B as a base model. Additionally, it achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 0.81 on GenEval while generating only 20 samples per prompt, surpassing the previous best score of 0.80, which was obtained using a significantly larger model (SANA-1.5-4.8B) with 2048 samples under the best-of-N approach.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Numerous approaches use replicated backbones or additional image encoders to extract garment features, leading to higher computational cost and a more complex network structure. In this work, we introduce ITVTON, which utilizes the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as a generator to enhance image quality. ITVTON also improves garment-person interaction by stitching garment and person images along the spatial channel, and integrates textual descriptions from both the garment and person images to further enhance the realism of the generated visuals. This network structure is efficient, and to further reduce computational cost, we constrain training to attention parameters within a single Diffusion Transformer (Single-DiT) block. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITVTON outperforms baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, thereby establishing a new benchmark for virtual try-on tasks.Additionally, 10,257 image pairs were selected from IGPair to demonstrate that ITVTON performs effectively in realistic scenes.</p></details> |  |

By treating each modality, e.g., observed joint angles ($X$) and ground reaction forces ($Y$), as complementary observations of a shared underlying locomotor dynamical system, our method aligns latent representations at each diffusion step, so that one modality can help denoise and disambiguate the other. Our alignment approach is motivated by the fact that local time windows of $X$ and $Y$ represent the same phase of an underlying dynamical system, thereby benefiting from a shared latent manifold. We introduce a simple local latent manifold alignment (LLMA) strategy that incorporates first-order and second-order alignment within the latent space for robust cross-modal biomechanical generation without bells and whistles. Through experiments on multimodal human biomechanics data, we show that aligning local latent dynamics across modalities improves generation fidelity and yields better representations.</p></details> |  |

Such a task is exciting to many downstream applications because the input layouts offer strong guidance to the generation process while remaining easily reconfigurable by humans. In this paper, we proposed STyled LAYout Diffusion (STAY Diffusion), a diffusion-based model that produces photo-realistic images and provides fine-grained control of stylized objects in scenes. Our approach learns a global condition for each layout, and a self-supervised semantic map for weight modulation using a novel Edge-Aware Normalization (EA Norm). A new Styled-Mask Attention (SM Attention) is also introduced to cross-condition the global condition and image feature for capturing the objects' relationships. These measures provide consistent guidance through the model, enabling more accurate and controllable image generation. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that our STAY Diffusion presents high-quality images while surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods in generation diversity, accuracy, and controllability.</p></details> | Accepted by WACV2025 |
| **[D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a score function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes the deformation from the previous round with this denoising process, allows \textit{anytime} refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI, approximately three times faster in a 3D holonomic case with 16 robots. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> |  |
