| **[LaM-SLidE: Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12128v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models are spearheading recent progress in deep learning, showing strong promise for trajectory sampling in dynamical systems as well. However, while latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), combines the advantages of graph neural networks, i.e., the traceability of entities across time-steps, with the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder are frozen to enable generative modeling in the latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is to introduce identifier representations (IDs) to allow for retrieval of entity properties, e.g., entity coordinates, from latent system representations and thus enables traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

| **[DLFR-VAE: Dynamic Latent Frame Rate VAE for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11897v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Latent Frame Rate VAE (DLFR-VAE), a training-free paradigm that can make use of adaptive temporal compression in latent space. While existing video generative models apply fixed compression rates via pretrained VAE, we observe that real-world video content exhibits substantial temporal non-uniformity, with high-motion segments containing more information than static scenes. Based on this insight, DLFR-VAE dynamically adjusts the latent frame rate according to the content complexity. Specifically, DLFR-VAE comprises two core innovations: (1) A Dynamic Latent Frame Rate Scheduler that partitions videos into temporal chunks and adaptively determines optimal frame rates based on information-theoretic content complexity, and (2) A training-free adaptation mechanism that transforms pretrained VAE architectures into a dynamic VAE that can process features with variable frame rates. Our simple but effective DLFR-VAE can function as a plug-and-play module, seamlessly integrating with existing video generation models and accelerating the video generation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[T2VEval: T2V-generated Videos Benchmark Dataset and Objective Evaluation Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08545v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) technology, as demonstrated by models such as Runway Gen-3, Pika, Sora, and Kling, have significantly broadened the applicability and popularity of the technology. This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of T2V-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-to-video outputs remain challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed T2VEval-Bench, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset for text-to-video quality evaluation, comprising 148 textual prompts and 1,783 videos generated by 13 T2V models. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we scored each video on four dimensions in the subjective experiment, which are overall impression, text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Based on T2VEval-Bench, we developed T2VEval, a multi-branch fusion scheme for T2V quality evaluation. T2VEval assesses videos across three branches: text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large language model. Additionally, we implemented a progressive training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-Centric Image to Video Generation with Language Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11655v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and flexible world models are crucial for autonomous systems to understand their environment and predict future events. Object-centric models, with structured latent spaces, have shown promise in modeling object dynamics and interactions, but often face challenges in scaling to complex datasets and incorporating external guidance, limiting their applicability in robotics. To address these limitations, we propose TextOCVP, an object-centric model for image-to-video generation guided by textual descriptions. TextOCVP parses an observed scene into object representations, called slots, and utilizes a text-conditioned transformer predictor to forecast future object states and video frames. Our approach jointly models object dynamics and interactions while incorporating textual guidance, thus leading to accurate and controllable predictions. Our method's structured latent space offers enhanced control over the prediction process, outperforming several image-to-video generative baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured object-centric representations provide superior controllability and interpretability, facilitating the modeling of object dynamics and enabling more precise and understandable predictions. Videos and code are available at https://play-slot.github.io/TextOCVP/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Step-Video-T2V Technical Report: The Practice, Challenges, and Future of Video Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10248v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Step-Video-T2V, a state-of-the-art text-to-video pre-trained model with 30B parameters and the ability to generate videos up to 204 frames in length. A deep compression Variational Autoencoder, Video-VAE, is designed for video generation tasks, achieving 16x16 spatial and 8x temporal compression ratios, while maintaining exceptional video reconstruction quality. User prompts are encoded using two bilingual text encoders to handle both English and Chinese. A DiT with 3D full attention is trained using Flow Matching and is employed to denoise input noise into latent frames. A video-based DPO approach, Video-DPO, is applied to reduce artifacts and improve the visual quality of the generated videos. We also detail our training strategies and share key observations and insights. Step-Video-T2V's performance is evaluated on a novel video generation benchmark, Step-Video-T2V-Eval, demonstrating its state-of-the-art text-to-video quality when compared with both open-source and commercial engines. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of current diffusion-based model paradigm and outline future directions for video foundation models. We make both Step-Video-T2V and Step-Video-T2V-Eval available at https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step-Video-T2V. The online version can be accessed from https://yuewen.cn/videos as well. Our goal is to accelerate the innovation of video foundation models and empower video content creators.</p></details> | 36 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Efficient-vDiT: Efficient Video Diffusion Transformers With Attention Tile](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06155v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the promise of synthesizing high-fidelity videos, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention suffer from expensive inference due to the complexity of attention computation and numerous sampling steps. For example, the popular Open-Sora-Plan model consumes more than 9 minutes for generating a single video of 29 frames. This paper addresses the inefficiency issue from two aspects: 1) Prune the 3D full attention based on the redundancy within video data; We identify a prevalent tile-style repetitive pattern in the 3D attention maps for video data, and advocate a new family of sparse 3D attention that holds a linear complexity w.r.t. the number of video frames. 2) Shorten the sampling process by adopting existing multi-step consistency distillation; We split the entire sampling trajectory into several segments and perform consistency distillation within each one to activate few-step generation capacities. We further devise a three-stage training pipeline to conjoin the low-complexity attention and few-step generation capacities. Notably, with 0.1% pretraining data, we turn the Open-Sora-Plan-1.2 model into an efficient one that is 7.4x -7.8x faster for 29 and 93 frames 720p video generation with a marginal performance trade-off in VBench. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach is amenable to distributed inference, achieving an additional 3.91x speedup when running on 4 GPUs with sequence parallelism.</p></details> |  |
| **[VidSketch: Hand-drawn Sketch-Driven Video Generation with Diffusion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01101v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of generative artificial intelligence, previous studies have achieved the task of generating aesthetic images from hand-drawn sketches, fulfilling the public's needs for drawing. However, these methods are limited to static images and lack the ability to control video animation generation using hand-drawn sketches. To address this gap, we propose VidSketch, the first method capable of generating high-quality video animations directly from any number of hand-drawn sketches and simple text prompts, bridging the divide between ordinary users and professional artists. Specifically, our method introduces a Level-Based Sketch Control Strategy to automatically adjust the guidance strength of sketches during the generation process, accommodating users with varying drawing skills. Furthermore, a TempSpatial Attention mechanism is designed to enhance the spatiotemporal consistency of generated video animations, significantly improving the coherence across frames. You can find more detailed cases on our official website.</p></details> | 17pages, 15 figures |
| **[Adapting Image-to-Video Diffusion Models for Large-Motion Frame Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17042v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of video generation models has advanced significantly in recent years, we adopt large-scale image-to-video diffusion models for video frame interpolation. We present a conditional encoder designed to adapt an image-to-video model for large-motion frame interpolation. To enhance performance, we integrate a dual-branch feature extractor and propose a cross-frame attention mechanism that effectively captures both spatial and temporal information, enabling accurate interpolations of intermediate frames. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on the Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) metric when evaluated against other state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in handling large motion scenarios, highlighting advancements in generative-based methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magic 1-For-1: Generating One Minute Video Clips within One Minute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07701v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this technical report, we present Magic 1-For-1 (Magic141), an efficient video generation model with optimized memory consumption and inference latency. The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average. We conduct a series of preliminary explorations to find out the optimal tradeoff between computational cost and video quality during diffusion step distillation and hope this could be a good foundation model for open-source explorations. The code and the model weights are available at https://github.com/DA-Group-PKU/Magic-1-For-1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Serio...</summary><p>Serious updates are needed</p></details> |
| **[MaskFlow: Discrete Flows For Flexible and Efficient Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11234v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating long, high-quality videos remains a challenge due to the complex interplay of spatial and temporal dynamics and hardware limitations. In this work, we introduce \textbf{MaskFlow}, a unified video generation framework that combines discrete representations with flow-matching to enable efficient generation of high-quality long videos. By leveraging a frame-level masking strategy during training, MaskFlow conditions on previously generated unmasked frames to generate videos with lengths ten times beyond that of the training sequences. MaskFlow does so very efficiently by enabling the use of fast Masked Generative Model (MGM)-style sampling and can be deployed in both fully autoregressive as well as full-sequence generation modes. We validate the quality of our method on the FaceForensics (FFS) and Deepmind Lab (DMLab) datasets and report Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. We also provide a detailed analysis on the sampling efficiency of our method and demonstrate that MaskFlow can be applied to both timestep-dependent and timestep-independent models in a training-free manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phantom: Subject-consistent video generation via cross-modal alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11079v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The continuous development of foundational models for video generation is evolving into various applications, with subject-consistent video generation still in the exploratory stage. We refer to this as Subject-to-Video, which extracts subject elements from reference images and generates subject-consistent video through textual instructions. We believe that the essence of subject-to-video lies in balancing the dual-modal prompts of text and image, thereby deeply and simultaneously aligning both text and visual content. To this end, we propose Phantom, a unified video generation framework for both single and multi-subject references. Building on existing text-to-video and image-to-video architectures, we redesign the joint text-image injection model and drive it to learn cross-modal alignment via text-image-video triplet data. In particular, we emphasize subject consistency in human generation, covering existing ID-preserving video generation while offering enhanced advantages.

| **[FLIP: Flow-Centric Generative Planning as General-Purpose Manipulation World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08261v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to develop a model-based planning framework for world models that can be scaled with increasing model and data budgets for general-purpose manipulation tasks with only language and vision inputs. To this end, we present FLow-centric generative Planning (FLIP), a model-based planning algorithm on visual space that features three key modules: 1. a multi-modal flow generation model as the general-purpose action proposal module; 2. a flow-conditioned video generation model as the dynamics module; and 3. a vision-language representation learning model as the value module. Given an initial image and language instruction as the goal, FLIP can progressively search for long-horizon flow and video plans that maximize the discounted return to accomplish the task. FLIP is able to synthesize long-horizon plans across objects, robots, and tasks with image flows as the general action representation, and the dense flow information also provides rich guidance for long-horizon video generation. In addition, the synthesized flow and video plans can guide the training of low-level control policies for robot execution. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FLIP can improve both the success rates and quality of long-horizon video plan synthesis and has the interactive world model property, opening up wider applications for future works.Video demos are on our website: https://nus-lins-lab.github.io/flipweb/.</p></details> |  |
| **[RealCam-I2V: Real-World Image-to-Video Generation with Interactive Complex Camera Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10059v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in camera-trajectory-guided image-to-video generation offer higher precision and better support for complex camera control compared to text-based approaches. However, they also introduce significant usability challenges, as users often struggle to provide precise camera parameters when working with arbitrary real-world images without knowledge of their depth nor scene scale. To address these real-world application issues, we propose RealCam-I2V, a novel diffusion-based video generation framework that integrates monocular metric depth estimation to establish 3D scene reconstruction in a preprocessing step. During training, the reconstructed 3D scene enables scaling camera parameters from relative to absolute values, ensuring compatibility and scale consistency across diverse real-world images. In inference, RealCam-I2V offers an intuitive interface where users can precisely draw camera trajectories by dragging within the 3D scene. To further enhance precise camera control and scene consistency, we propose scene-constrained noise shaping, which shapes high-level noise and also allows the framework to maintain dynamic, coherent video generation in lower noise stages. RealCam-I2V achieves significant improvements in controllability and video quality on the RealEstate10K and out-of-domain images. We further enables applications like camera-controlled looping video generation and generative frame interpolation. We will release our absolute-scale annotation, codes, and all checkpoints. Please see dynamic results in https://zgctroy.github.io/RealCam-I2V.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Video Coding Meets Multimodal Large Language Models: A Unified Paradigm for Video Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08093v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing codecs are designed to eliminate intrinsic redundancies to create a compact representation for compression. However, strong external priors from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have not been explicitly explored in video compression. Herein, we introduce a unified paradigm for Cross-Modality Video Coding (CMVC), which is a pioneering approach to explore multimodality representation and video generative models in video coding. Specifically, on the encoder side, we disentangle a video into spatial content and motion components, which are subsequently transformed into distinct modalities to achieve very compact representation by leveraging MLLMs. During decoding, previously encoded components and video generation models are leveraged to create multiple encoding-decoding modes that optimize video reconstruction quality for specific decoding requirements, including Text-Text-to-Video (TT2V) mode to ensure high-quality semantic information and Image-Text-to-Video (IT2V) mode to achieve superb perceptual consistency. In addition, we propose an efficient frame interpolation model for IT2V mode via Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) tuning to guarantee perceptual quality, which allows the generated motion cues to behave smoothly. Experiments on benchmarks indicate that TT2V achieves effective semantic reconstruction, while IT2V exhibits competitive perceptual consistency. These results highlight potential directions for future research in video coding.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEVRM: Goal-Expressive Video Generation Model For Robust Visual Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09268v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of embodied artificial intelligence, significant progress has been made in vision-language-action (VLA) models for general robot decision-making. However, the majority of existing VLAs fail to account for the inevitable external perturbations encountered during deployment. These perturbations introduce unforeseen state information to the VLA, resulting in inaccurate actions and consequently, a significant decline in generalization performance. The classic internal model control (IMC) principle demonstrates that a closed-loop system with an internal model that includes external input signals can accurately track the reference input and effectively offset the disturbance. We propose a novel closed-loop VLA method GEVRM that integrates the IMC principle to enhance the robustness of robot visual manipulation. The text-guided video generation model in GEVRM can generate highly expressive future visual planning goals. Simultaneously, we evaluate perturbations by simulating responses, which are called internal embeddings and optimized through prototype contrastive learning. This allows the model to implicitly infer and distinguish perturbations from the external environment. The proposed GEVRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both standard and perturbed CALVIN benchmarks and shows significant improvements in realistic robot tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhance-A-Video: Better Generated Video for Free](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07508v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DiT-based video generation has achieved remarkable results, but research into enhancing existing models remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce a training-free approach to enhance the coherence and quality of DiT-based generated videos, named Enhance-A-Video. The core idea is enhancing the cross-frame correlations based on non-diagonal temporal attention distributions. Thanks to its simple design, our approach can be easily applied to most DiT-based video generation frameworks without any retraining or fine-tuning. Across various DiT-based video generation models, our approach demonstrates promising improvements in both temporal consistency and visual quality. We hope this research can inspire future explorations in video generation enhancement.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenVid-1M: A Large-Scale High-Quality Dataset for Text-to-video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02371v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently garnered significant attention thanks to the large multi-modality model Sora. However, T2V generation still faces two important challenges: 1) Lacking a precise open sourced high-quality dataset. The previous popular video datasets, e.g. WebVid-10M and Panda-70M, are either with low quality or too large for most research institutions. Therefore, it is challenging but crucial to collect a precise high-quality text-video pairs for T2V generation. 2) Ignoring to fully utilize textual information. Recent T2V methods have focused on vision transformers, using a simple cross attention module for video generation, which falls short of thoroughly extracting semantic information from text prompt. To address these issues, we introduce OpenVid-1M, a precise high-quality dataset with expressive captions. This open-scenario dataset contains over 1 million text-video pairs, facilitating research on T2V generation. Furthermore, we curate 433K 1080p videos from OpenVid-1M to create OpenVidHD-0.4M, advancing high-definition video generation. Additionally, we propose a novel Multi-modal Video Diffusion Transformer (MVDiT) capable of mining both structure information from visual tokens and semantic information from text tokens. Extensive experiments and ablation studies verify the superiority of OpenVid-1M over previous datasets and the effectiveness of our MVDiT.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 15 figures, Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[OmniHuman-1: Rethinking the Scaling-Up of One-Stage Conditioned Human Animation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01061v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end human animation, such as audio-driven talking human generation, has undergone notable advancements in the recent few years. However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals).

Our goal is to empower users with comparable controllability as professional film directors: precise placement of objects within the scene, flexible manipulation of both objects and camera in 3D space, and intuitive layout control over the rendered frames. To achieve this, CineMaster operates in two stages. In the first stage, we design an interactive workflow that allows users to intuitively construct 3D-aware conditional signals by positioning object bounding boxes and defining camera movements within the 3D space. In the second stage, these control signals--comprising rendered depth maps, camera trajectories and object class labels--serve as the guidance for a text-to-video diffusion model, ensuring to generate the user-intended video content. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of in-the-wild datasets with 3D object motion and camera pose annotations, we carefully establish an automated data annotation pipeline that extracts 3D bounding boxes and camera trajectories from large-scale video data. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that CineMaster significantly outperforms existing methods and implements prominent 3D-aware text-to-video generation.

| **[Next Block Prediction: Video Generation via Semi-Autoregressive Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07737v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next-Token Prediction (NTP) is a de facto approach for autoregressive (AR) video generation, but it suffers from suboptimal unidirectional dependencies and slow inference speed. In this work, we propose a semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation. By uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or frames), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks, allowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the corresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our framework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to capture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in parallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps, leading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores of 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an average of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps, the NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128x128 resolution) per second, achieving an 11x speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B parameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD scores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://renshuhuai-andy.github.io/NBP-project/</p></details> |

Building on this success, Lumina-Next achieves exceptional performance in the generation of photorealistic images with Next-DiT. However, its potential for video generation remains largely untapped, with significant challenges in modeling the spatiotemporal complexity inherent to video data. To address this, we introduce Lumina-Video, a framework that leverages the strengths of Next-DiT while introducing tailored solutions for video synthesis. Lumina-Video incorporates a Multi-scale Next-DiT architecture, which jointly learns multiple patchifications to enhance both efficiency and flexibility. By incorporating the motion score as an explicit condition, Lumina-Video also enables direct control of generated videos' dynamic degree. Combined with a progressive training scheme with increasingly higher resolution and FPS, and a multi-source training scheme with mixed natural and synthetic data, Lumina-Video achieves remarkable aesthetic quality and motion smoothness at high training and inference efficiency. We additionally propose Lumina-V2A, a video-to-audio model based on Next-DiT, to create synchronized sounds for generated videos.

| **[FloVD: Optical Flow Meets Video Diffusion Model for Enhanced Camera-Controlled Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08244v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents FloVD, a novel optical-flow-based video diffusion model for camera-controllable video generation. FloVD leverages optical flow maps to represent motions of the camera and moving objects. This approach offers two key benefits. Since optical flow can be directly estimated from videos, our approach allows for the use of arbitrary training videos without ground-truth camera parameters. Moreover, as background optical flow encodes 3D correlation across different viewpoints, our method enables detailed camera control by leveraging the background motion. To synthesize natural object motion while supporting detailed camera control, our framework adopts a two-stage video synthesis pipeline consisting of optical flow generation and flow-conditioned video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches in terms of accurate camera control and natural object motion synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://jinwonjoon.github.io/flovd_site/</p></details> |
| **[Learning Human Skill Generators at Key-Step Levels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08234v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are committed to learning human skill generators at key-step levels. The generation of skills is a challenging endeavor, but its successful implementation could greatly facilitate human skill learning and provide more experience for embodied intelligence. Although current video generation models can synthesis simple and atomic human operations, they struggle with human skills due to their complex procedure process. Human skills involve multi-step, long-duration actions and complex scene transitions, so the existing naive auto-regressive methods for synthesizing long videos cannot generate human skills. To address this, we propose a novel task, the Key-step Skill Generation (KS-Gen), aimed at reducing the complexity of generating human skill videos. Given the initial state and a skill description, the task is to generate video clips of key steps to complete the skill, rather than a full-length video. To support this task, we introduce a carefully curated dataset and define multiple evaluation metrics to assess performance. Considering the complexity of KS-Gen, we propose a new framework for this task. First, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) generates descriptions for key steps using retrieval argument. Subsequently, we use a Key-step Image Generator (KIG) to address the discontinuity between key steps in skill videos.

| **[AnyCharV: Bootstrap Controllable Character Video Generation with Fine-to-Coarse Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08189v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Character video generation is a significant real-world application focused on producing high-quality videos featuring specific characters. Recent advancements have introduced various control signals to animate static characters, successfully enhancing control over the generation process. However, these methods often lack flexibility, limiting their applicability and making it challenging for users to synthesize a source character into a desired target scene. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, AnyCharV, that flexibly generates character videos using arbitrary source characters and target scenes, guided by pose information. Our approach involves a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we develop a base model capable of integrating the source character with the target scene using pose guidance. The second stage further bootstraps controllable generation through a self-boosting mechanism, where we use the generated video in the first stage and replace the fine mask with the coarse one, enabling training outcomes with better preservation of character details. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

However, these methods are unable to offer control over multiple visual elements due to limitations in data and network efficacy. In this paper, we introduce VidCRAFT3, a novel framework for precise image-to-video generation that enables control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction simultaneously. To better decouple control over each visual element, we propose the Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer, which integrates lighting direction, text, and image in a symmetric way. Since most real-world video datasets lack lighting annotations, we construct a high-quality synthetic video dataset, the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset. This dataset includes lighting direction annotations and objects of diverse appearance, enabling VidCRAFT3 to effectively handle strong light transmission and reflection effects. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training strategy that eliminates the need for training data annotated with multiple visual elements (camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction) simultaneously. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of VidCRAFT3 in producing high-quality video content, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of control granularity and visual coherence. All code and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Ghost: Investigating Ranking Bias Hidden in AI-Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07327v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), the creation of high-quality AI-generated videos has become faster and easier, resulting in the Internet being flooded with all kinds of video content. However, the impact of these videos on the content ecosystem remains largely unexplored. Video information retrieval remains a fundamental approach for accessing video content. Building on the observation that retrieval models often favor AI-generated content in ad-hoc and image retrieval tasks, we investigate whether similar biases emerge in the context of challenging video retrieval, where temporal and visual factors may further influence model behavior. To explore this, we first construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing both real and AI-generated videos, along with a set of fair and rigorous metrics to assess bias. This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by two state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously design a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference, accounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and suboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video retrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our findings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval. Further investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the training set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference observed in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from both unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video bias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we fine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach. The results of this study highlight the potential implications of AI-generated videos on retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the text input allows us to tap into the power of modern-day video diffusion to generate plausible motion samples for the right object category and part. In turn, the input 3D object provides image prompting to personalize the generated video to that very object we wish to articulate. Our method starts with a few-shot finetuning for category-specific motion generation, a key first step to compensate for the lack of articulation awareness by current video diffusion models. For this, we finetune a pre-trained multi-view image generation model for controllable multi-view video generation, using a small collection of video samples obtained for the target object category. This is followed by motion video personalization that is realized by multi-view rendered images of the target 3D object. At last, we transfer the personalized video motion to the target 3D object via differentiable rendering to optimize part motion parameters by a score distillation sampling loss. We show that our method is capable of generating realistic motion videos and predict 3D motion parameters in a more accurate and generalizable way, compared to prior works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 16 pages</p></details> |

Despite recent advancements, existing methods struggle with accurately identifying the rhythmic or semantic triggers from audio for generating contextualized gesture patterns and achieving pixel-level realism. To address these challenges, we introduce Contextual Gesture, a framework that improves co-speech gesture video generation through three innovative components: (1) a chronological speech-gesture alignment that temporally connects two modalities, (2) a contextualized gesture tokenization that incorporate speech context into motion pattern representation through distillation, and (3) a structure-aware refinement module that employs edge connection to link gesture keypoints to improve video generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Contextual Gesture not only produces realistic and speech-aligned gesture videos but also supports long-sequence generation and video gesture editing applications, shown in Fig.1 Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Contextual-Gesture/.</p></details> |  |

Many creators repurpose their long-form videos to produce short-form videos, but creators report that planning, extracting, and arranging clips from long-form videos is challenging. Currently, creators make extractive short-form videos composed of existing long-form video clips or abstractive short-form videos by adding newly recorded narration to visuals. While extractive videos maintain the original connection between audio and visuals, abstractive videos offer flexibility in selecting content to be included in a shorter time. We present Lotus, a system that combines both approaches to balance preserving the original content with flexibility over the content. Lotus first creates an abstractive short-form video by generating both a short-form script and its corresponding speech, then matching long-form video clips to the generated narration. Creators can then add extractive clips with an automated method or Lotus's editing interface. Lotus's interface can be used to further refine the short-form video. We compare short-form videos generated by Lotus with those using an extractive baseline method. In our user study, we compare creating short-form videos using Lotus to participants' existing practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, ACM IUI 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel conditional diffusion model with spatial attention and latent embedding (cDAL) for medical image segmentation. In cDAL, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based discriminator is used at every time-step of the diffusion process to distinguish between the generated labels and the real ones. A spatial attention map is computed based on the features learned by the discriminator to help cDAL generate more accurate segmentation of discriminative regions in an input image. Additionally, we incorporated a random latent embedding into each layer of our model to significantly reduce the number of training and sampling time-steps, thereby making it much faster than other diffusion models for image segmentation. We applied cDAL on 3 publicly available medical image segmentation datasets (MoNuSeg, Chest X-ray and Hippocampus) and observed significant qualitative and quantitative improvements with higher Dice scores and mIoU over the state-of-the-art algorithms.

| **[History-Guided Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06764v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a key technique for improving conditional generation in diffusion models, enabling more accurate control while enhancing sample quality. It is natural to extend this technique to video diffusion, which generates video conditioned on a variable number of context frames, collectively referred to as history. However, we find two key challenges to guiding with variable-length history: architectures that only support fixed-size conditioning, and the empirical observation that CFG-style history dropout performs poorly. To address this, we propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), a video diffusion architecture and theoretically grounded training objective that jointly enable conditioning on a flexible number of history frames. We then introduce History Guidance, a family of guidance methods uniquely enabled by DFoT. We show that its simplest form, vanilla history guidance, already significantly improves video generation quality and temporal consistency. A more advanced method, history guidance across time and frequency further enhances motion dynamics, enables compositional generalization to out-of-distribution history, and can stably roll out extremely long videos.

However, current video editing methods still suffer from several challenges. Inversion-based methods, though training-free and flexible, are time-consuming during inference, struggle with fine-grained editing instructions, and produce artifacts and jitter. On the other hand, end-to-end methods, which rely on edited video pairs for training, offer faster inference speeds but often produce poor editing results due to a lack of high-quality training video pairs. In this paper, to close the gap in end-to-end methods, we introduce Se\~norita-2M, a high-quality video editing dataset. Se\~norita-2M consists of approximately 2 millions of video editing pairs. It is built by crafting four high-quality, specialized video editing models, each crafted and trained by our team to achieve state-of-the-art editing results. We also propose a filtering pipeline to eliminate poorly edited video pairs. Furthermore, we explore common video editing architectures to identify the most effective structure based on current pre-trained generative model. Extensive experiments show that our dataset can help to yield remarkably high-quality video editing results. More details are available at https://senorita.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do generative video models learn physical principles from watching videos?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09038v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI video generation is undergoing a revolution, with quality and realism advancing rapidly. These advances have led to a passionate scientific debate: Do video models learn "world models" that discover laws of physics -- or, alternatively, are they merely sophisticated pixel predictors that achieve visual realism without understanding the physical principles of reality? We address this question by developing Physics-IQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that can only be solved by acquiring a deep understanding of various physical principles, like fluid dynamics, optics, solid mechanics, magnetism and thermodynamics. We find that across a range of current models (Sora, Runway, Pika, Lumiere, Stable Video Diffusion, and VideoPoet), physical understanding is severely limited, and unrelated to visual realism. At the same time, some test cases can already be successfully solved. This indicates that acquiring certain physical principles from observation alone may be possible, but significant challenges remain. While we expect rapid advances ahead, our work demonstrates that visual realism does not imply physical understanding.

However, 3D shape generation technology has so far lagged behind, constrained by limitations in 3D data scale, complexity of 3D data process- ing, and insufficient exploration of advanced tech- niques in the 3D domain. Current approaches to 3D shape generation face substantial challenges in terms of output quality, generalization capa- bility, and alignment with input conditions. We present TripoSG, a new streamlined shape diffu- sion paradigm capable of generating high-fidelity 3D meshes with precise correspondence to input images. Specifically, we propose: 1) A large-scale rectified flow transformer for 3D shape generation, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity through training on extensive, high-quality data. 2) A hybrid supervised training strategy combining SDF, normal, and eikonal losses for 3D VAE, achieving high- quality 3D reconstruction performance. 3) A data processing pipeline to generate 2 million high- quality 3D samples, highlighting the crucial rules for data quality and quantity in training 3D gen- erative models. Through comprehensive experi- ments, we have validated the effectiveness of each component in our new framework. The seamless integration of these parts has enabled TripoSG to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape generation. The resulting 3D shapes exhibit en- hanced detail due to high-resolution capabilities and demonstrate exceptional fidelity to input im- ages. Moreover, TripoSG demonstrates improved versatility in generating 3D models from diverse image styles and contents, showcasing strong gen- eralization capabilities. To foster progress and innovation in the field of 3D generation, we will make our model publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences.

In this paper, we introduce CustomVideoX, an innovative framework leveraging the video diffusion transformer for personalized video generation from a reference image. CustomVideoX capitalizes on pre-trained video networks by exclusively training the LoRA parameters to extract reference features, ensuring both efficiency and adaptability. To facilitate seamless interaction between the reference image and video content, we propose 3D Reference Attention, which enables direct and simultaneous engagement of reference image features with all video frames across spatial and temporal dimensions. To mitigate the excessive influence of reference image features and textual guidance on generated video content during inference, we implement the Time-Aware Reference Attention Bias (TAB) strategy, dynamically modulating reference bias over different time steps. Additionally, we introduce the Entity Region-Aware Enhancement (ERAE) module, aligning highly activated regions of key entity tokens with reference feature injection by adjusting attention bias. To thoroughly evaluate personalized video generation, we establish a new benchmark, VideoBench, comprising over 50 objects and 100 prompts for extensive assessment. Experimental results show that CustomVideoX significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of video consistency and quality.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

However, they often generate clips based on static prompts (e.g., text or images), limiting their ability to model interactive and dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic World Simulation (DWS), a novel approach to transform pre-trained video generative models into controllable world simulators capable of executing specified action trajectories. To achieve precise alignment between conditioned actions and generated visual changes, we introduce a lightweight, universal action-conditioned module that seamlessly integrates into any existing model. Instead of focusing on complex visual details, we demonstrate that consistent dynamic transition modeling is the key to building powerful world simulators. Building upon this insight, we further introduce a motion-reinforced loss that enhances action controllability by compelling the model to capture dynamic changes more effectively. Experiments demonstrate that DWS can be versatilely applied to both diffusion and autoregressive transformer models, achieving significant improvements in generating action-controllable, dynamically consistent videos across games and robotics domains. Moreover, to facilitate the applications of the learned world simulator in downstream tasks such as model-based reinforcement learning, we propose prioritized imagination to improve sample efficiency, demonstrating competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 20 pages |

To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrices $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrices $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK^\top$. Third, we propose a two-level accumulation strategy for $\widetilde PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 4.5x on RTX4090, respectively. Moreover, SageAttention2 matches the speed of FlashAttention3(fp8) on the Hopper GPUs, while delivering much higher accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for language, image, and video generation.

Given an image observation and a language instruction, previous work has generated video plans which are then converted to robot controls to be executed. However, a major bottleneck in leveraging video generation for control lies in the quality of the generated videos, which often suffer from hallucinatory content and unrealistic physics, resulting in low task success when control actions are extracted from the generated videos. While scaling up dataset and model size provides a partial solution, integrating external feedback is both natural and essential for grounding video generation in the real world. With this observation, we propose VideoAgent for self-improving generated video plans based on external feedback. Instead of directly executing the generated video plan, VideoAgent first refines the generated video plans using a novel procedure which we call self-conditioning consistency, allowing inference-time compute to be turned into better generated video plans. As the refined video plan is being executed, VideoAgent can collect additional data from the environment to further improve video plan generation. Experiments in simulated robotic manipulation from MetaWorld and iTHOR show that VideoAgent drastically reduces hallucination, thereby boosting success rate of downstream manipulation tasks. We further illustrate that VideoAgent can effectively refine real-robot videos, providing an early indicator that robots can be an effective tool in grounding video generation in the physical world.

The text component of our model extracts information for manual and non-manual components of ASL, which are used to synthesize skeletal pose sequences and corresponding video frames. Our findings from a user study with 30 DHH participants and thorough technical evaluations demonstrate significant progress and identify critical areas necessary to meet user needs.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2025 |

However, their current utility in these fields is severely limited by an inability to enforce strict adherence to physical laws and domain-specific constraints. Without this grounding, the deployment of such models in critical applications, ranging from material science to safety-critical systems, remains impractical. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing a novel approach to integrate stable diffusion models with constrained optimization frameworks, enabling them to generate outputs that satisfy stringent physical and functional requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through material science experiments requiring adherence to precise morphometric properties, inverse design problems involving the generation of stress-strain responses using video generation with a simulator in the loop, and safety settings where outputs must avoid copyright infringement.</p></details> |  |

High content and motion fidelity aligned with text prompts, however, often require large model parameters and a substantial number of function evaluations (NFEs). Realistic and visually appealing details are typically reflected in high resolution outputs, further amplifying computational demands especially for single stage DiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two stage framework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs across stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage, prompt fidelity is prioritized through a low resolution generation process utilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational efficiency. The second stage establishes flow matching between low and high resolutions, effectively generating fine details with minimal NFEs. Quantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves state-of-the-art high resolution video generation with superior computational efficiency.

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

| **[Fast Video Generation with Sliding Tile Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04507v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention power state-of-the-art video generation, but suffer from prohibitive compute cost -- when generating just a 5-second 720P video, attention alone takes 800 out of 945 seconds of total inference time. This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to address this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in pretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D windows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA eliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise sliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel hardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being hardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the first efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving 58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over FlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading video DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s without quality degradation, requiring no training. Enabling finetuning further lowers latency to 268s with only a 0.09% drop on VBench.</p></details> |  |

Shot design, a critical aspect of filmmaking, involves meticulously planning both camera movements and object motions in a scene. However, enabling intuitive shot design in modern image-to-video generation systems presents two main challenges: first, effectively capturing user intentions on the motion design, where both camera movements and scene-space object motions must be specified jointly; and second, representing motion information that can be effectively utilized by a video diffusion model to synthesize the image animations. To address these challenges, we introduce MotionCanvas, a method that integrates user-driven controls into image-to-video (I2V) generation models, allowing users to control both object and camera motions in a scene-aware manner. By connecting insights from classical computer graphics and contemporary video generation techniques, we demonstrate the ability to achieve 3D-aware motion control in I2V synthesis without requiring costly 3D-related training data. MotionCanvas enables users to intuitively depict scene-space motion intentions, and translates them into spatiotemporal motion-conditioning signals for video diffusion models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of real-world image content and shot-design scenarios, highlighting its potential to enhance the creative workflows in digital content creation and adapt to various image and video editing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>It is...</summary><p>It is best viewed in Acrobat.

These models substantially mitigate flickering artifacts prevalent in prior models, enable longer and complex text prompts and generate longer videos with intricate, diverse motion patterns. Conventional VQA methods designed for simple text and basic motion patterns struggle to evaluate these content-rich videos. To this end, we propose \textbf{CRAVE} (\underline{C}ontent-\underline{R}ich \underline{A}IGC \underline{V}ideo \underline{E}valuator), specifically for the evaluation of Sora-era AIGC videos. CRAVE proposes the multi-granularity text-temporal fusion that aligns long-form complex textual semantics with video dynamics. Additionally, CRAVE leverages the hybrid motion-fidelity modeling to assess temporal artifacts. Furthermore, given the straightforward prompts and content in current AIGC VQA datasets, we introduce \textbf{CRAVE-DB}, a benchmark featuring content-rich videos from next-generation models paired with elaborate prompts. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed CRAVE achieves excellent results on multiple AIGC VQA benchmarks, demonstrating a high degree of alignment with human perception.

Notably, attention differences between adjacent diffusion steps follow a U-shaped pattern. Current methods leverage this property by caching attention blocks, however, they still struggle with sudden error spikes and large discrepancies. To address these issues, we propose UniCP a unified caching and pruning framework for efficient video generation. UniCP optimizes both temporal and spatial dimensions through. Error Aware Dynamic Cache Window (EDCW): Dynamically adjusts cache window sizes for different blocks at various timesteps, adapting to abrupt error changes. PCA based Slicing (PCAS) and Dynamic Weight Shift (DWS): PCAS prunes redundant attention components, and DWS integrates caching and pruning by enabling dynamic switching between pruned and cached outputs. By adjusting cache windows and pruning redundant components, UniCP enhances computational efficiency and maintains video detail fidelity. Experimental results show that UniCP outperforms existing methods in both performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we augment 2D videos with 3D point trajectories and align them in pixel space. The resulting 3D-aware video dataset, PointVid, is then used to fine-tune a latent diffusion model, enabling it to track 2D objects with 3D Cartesian coordinates. Building on this, we regularize the shape and motion of objects in the video to eliminate undesired artifacts, \eg, nonphysical deformation. Consequently, we enhance the quality of generated RGB videos and alleviate common issues like object morphing, which are prevalent in current video models due to a lack of shape awareness. With our 3D augmentation and regularization, our model is capable of handling contact-rich scenarios such as task-oriented videos. These videos involve complex interactions of solids, where 3D information is essential for perceiving deformation and contact. Furthermore, our model improves the overall quality of video generation by promoting the 3D consistency of moving objects and reducing abrupt changes in shape and motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: \url{https://snap-research.github.io/PointVidGen/}</p></details> |

The key technique is the motion field agent that converts motion information in text prompts into explicit motion fields, providing flexible and precise motion guidance. Specifically, the agent extracts the object movement and camera motion described in the text and converts them into object trajectories and camera extrinsics, respectively. An analytical optical flow composition module integrates these motion representations in 3D space and projects them into a unified optical flow. An optical flow adapter takes the flow to control the base image-to-video diffusion model for generating fine-grained controlled videos. The significant improvement in the Video-Text Camera Motion metrics on VBench indicates that our method achieves precise control over camera motion. We construct a subset of VBench to evaluate the alignment of motion information in the text and the generated video, outperforming other advanced models on motion generation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, efficiently training video diffusion models capable of integrating directional guidance and controllable motion intensity remains a challenging and under-explored area. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces Mojito, a diffusion model that incorporates both motion trajectory and intensity control for text-to-video generation. Specifically, Mojito features a Directional Motion Control (DMC) module that leverages cross-attention to efficiently direct the generated object's motion without training, alongside a Motion Intensity Modulator (MIM) that uses optical flow maps generated from videos to guide varying levels of motion intensity. Extensive experiments demonstrate Mojito's effectiveness in achieving precise trajectory and intensity control with high computational efficiency, generating motion patterns that closely match specified directions and intensities, providing realistic dynamics that align well with natural motion in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqPrior: Improving Video Diffusion Models with Frequency Filtering Gaussian Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03496v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven video generation has advanced significantly due to developments in diffusion models. Beyond the training and sampling phases, recent studies have investigated noise priors of diffusion models, as improved noise priors yield better generation results. One recent approach employs the Fourier transform to manipulate noise, marking the initial exploration of frequency operations in this context. However, it often generates videos that lack motion dynamics and imaging details. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the variance decay issue present in existing methods, contributing to the loss of details and motion dynamics. Recognizing the critical impact of noise distribution on generation quality, we introduce FreqPrior, a novel noise initialization strategy that refines noise in the frequency domain. Our method features a novel filtering technique designed to address different frequency signals while maintaining the noise prior distribution that closely approximates a standard Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we propose a partial sampling process by perturbing the latent at an intermediate timestep during finding the noise prior, significantly reducing inference time without compromising quality. Extensive experiments on VBench demonstrate that our method achieves the highest scores in both quality and semantic assessments, resulting in the best overall total score. These results highlight the superiority of our proposed noise prior.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, they are still hard to meet requirements of applications due to unsatisfied generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose to align video foundation models with human preferences from the perspective of post-training in this paper. Consequently, we introduce an Iterative Preference Optimization strategy to enhance generated video quality by incorporating human feedback. Specifically, IPO exploits a critic model to justify video generations for pairwise ranking as in Direct Preference Optimization or point-wise scoring as in Kahneman-Tversky Optimization. Given this, IPO optimizes video foundation models with guidance of signals from preference feedback, which helps improve generated video quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. In addition, IPO incorporates the critic model with the multi-modality large language model, which enables it to automatically assign preference labels without need of retraining or relabeling. In this way, IPO can efficiently perform multi-round preference optimization in an iterative manner, without the need of tediously manual labeling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IPO can effectively improve the video generation quality of a pretrained model and help a model with only 2B parameters surpass the one with 5B parameters. Besides, IPO achieves new state-of-the-art performance on VBench benchmark. We will release our source codes, models as well as dataset to advance future research and applications.</p></details> |  |

Building on Open-Sora, On-device Sora applies three novel techniques to address the challenges of diffusion-based text-to-video generation on computation- and memory-limited mobile devices. First, Linear Proportional Leap (LPL) reduces the excessive denoising steps required in video diffusion through an efficient leap-based approach. Second, Temporal Dimension Token Merging (TDTM) minimizes intensive token-processing computation in attention layers by merging consecutive tokens along the temporal dimension. Third, Concurrent Inference with Dynamic Loading (CI-DL) dynamically partitions large models into smaller blocks and loads them into memory for concurrent model inference, effectively addressing the challenges of limited device memory. We implement On-device Sora on the iPhone 15 Pro, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate that it is capable of generating high-quality videos on the device, comparable to those produced by Open-Sora running on high-end GPUs. These results show that On-device Sora enables efficient and high-quality video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices, expanding accessibility, ensuring user privacy, reducing dependence on cloud infrastructure, and lowering associated costs. We envision the proposed On-device Sora as a significant first step toward democratizing state-of-the-art generative technologies, enabling video generation capabilities on commodity mobile and embedded devices.

However, current VGM optimization primarily emphasizes the global quality of videos, overlooking localized errors, which leads to suboptimal generation capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a post-training strategy for VGMs, HALO, which explicitly incorporates local feedback from a patch reward model, providing detailed and comprehensive training signals with the video reward model for advanced VGM optimization. To develop an effective patch reward model, we distill GPT-4o to continuously train our video reward model, which enhances training efficiency and ensures consistency between video and patch reward distributions. Furthermore, to harmoniously integrate patch rewards into VGM optimization, we introduce a granular DPO (Gran-DPO) algorithm for DMs, allowing collaborative use of both patch and video rewards during the optimization process. Experimental results indicate that our patch reward model aligns well with human annotations and HALO substantially outperforms the baselines across two evaluation methods. Further experiments quantitatively prove the existence of patch defects, and our proposed method could effectively alleviate this issue.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling independent control over motion and identity. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We show that this limitation arises from the conventional pixel reconstruction objective, which biases models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of motion coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoJAM, a novel framework that instills an effective motion prior to video generators, by encouraging the model to learn a joint appearance-motion representation. VideoJAM is composed of two complementary units. During training, we extend the objective to predict both the generated pixels and their corresponding motion from a single learned representation. During inference, we introduce Inner-Guidance, a mechanism that steers the generation toward coherent motion by leveraging the model's own evolving motion prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. Notably, our framework can be applied to any video model with minimal adaptations, requiring no modifications to the training data or scaling of the model. VideoJAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion coherence, surpassing highly competitive proprietary models while also enhancing the perceived visual quality of the generations. These findings emphasize that appearance and motion can be complementary and, when effectively integrated, enhance both the visual quality and the coherence of video generation.

Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory.</p></details> | 56 pages, 13 figures |

Unlike prior works, which randomly sampled latent patches for video generation, our method relies on current strong pre-trained image generation models, modeling a certain caption-guided flow of latent patches that can be decoded to time-dependent video frames. We first speculate multiple images of a video are differentiable with respect to time in some latent space. Based on this conjecture, we introduce the HiPPO framework to approximate the optimal projection for polynomials to generate the probability path. Our approach gains the theoretical benefits of the bounded universal approximation error and timescale robustness. Moreover, VLFM processes the interpolation and extrapolation abilities for video generation with arbitrary frame rates. We conduct experiments on several text-to-video datasets to showcase the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | 39 pages, 6 figures |

This paper introduces imitation learning with latent video planning (VILP). We propose a latent video diffusion model to generate predictive robot videos that adhere to temporal consistency to a good degree. Our method is able to generate highly time-aligned videos from multiple views, which is crucial for robot policy learning. Our video generation model is highly time-efficient. For example, it can generate videos from two distinct perspectives, each consisting of six frames with a resolution of 96x160 pixels, at a rate of 5 Hz. In the experiments, we demonstrate that VILP outperforms the existing video generation robot policy across several metrics: training costs, inference speed, temporal consistency of generated videos, and the performance of the policy. We also compared our method with other imitation learning methods. Our findings indicate that VILP can rely less on extensive high-quality task-specific robot action data while still maintaining robust performance. In addition, VILP possesses robust capabilities in representing multi-modal action distributions. Our paper provides a practical example of how to effectively integrate video generation models into robot policies, potentially offering insights for related fields and directions.

This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Recently, consistency models have demonstrated impressive performance, achieving results on par with diffusion models in the pixel space. However, the success of scaling consistency training to large-scale datasets, particularly for text-to-image and video generation tasks, is determined by performance in the latent space. In this work, we analyze the statistical differences between pixel and latent spaces, discovering that latent data often contains highly impulsive outliers, which significantly degrade the performance of iCT in the latent space. To address this, we replace Pseudo-Huber losses with Cauchy losses, effectively mitigating the impact of outliers. Additionally, we introduce a diffusion loss at early timesteps and employ optimal transport (OT) coupling to further enhance performance. Lastly, we introduce the adaptive scaling-$c$ scheduler to manage the robust training process and adopt Non-scaling LayerNorm in the architecture to better capture the statistics of the features and reduce outlier impact. With these strategies, we successfully train latent consistency models capable of high-quality sampling with one or two steps, significantly narrowing the performance gap between latent consistency and diffusion models.

However, the essential efficiency of these models comes from formulating a limited recurrent state, enforcing causality among tokens that are prone to inconsistent modeling of N-dimensional visual data, leaving questions on their capacity to generate long non-causal sequences. In this paper, we explore the boundary of SSM on image and video generation by building the largest-scale diffusion SSM-Transformer hybrid model to date (5B parameters) based on the sub-quadratic bi-directional Hydra and self-attention, and generate up to 2K images and 360p 8 seconds (16 FPS) videos.

However, existing T2V generation methods lack a well-formed pipeline with exact loss function to guide the alignment of generated videos with human preferences using DPO strategies. Additionally, challenges such as the scarcity of paired video preference data hinder effective model training. At the same time, the lack of training datasets poses a risk of insufficient flexibility and poor video generation quality in the generated videos. Based on those problems, our work proposes three targeted solutions in sequence. 1) Our work is the first to introduce the DPO strategy into the T2V tasks. By deriving a carefully structured loss function, we utilize human feedback to align video generation with human preferences. We refer to this new method as HuViDPO. 2) Our work constructs small-scale human preference datasets for each action category and fine-tune this model, improving the aesthetic quality of the generated videos while reducing training costs. 3) We adopt a First-Frame-Conditioned strategy, leveraging the rich in formation from the first frame to guide the generation of subsequent frames, enhancing flexibility in video generation. At the same time, we employ a SparseCausal Attention mechanism to enhance the quality of the generated videos.More details and examples can be accessed on our website: https://tankowa.github.io/HuViDPO. github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Image is Secretly the Last Frame of a Pseudo Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20158v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, which can be viewed as a special case of hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), have shown profound success in generating photo-realistic images. In contrast, standard HVAEs often produce images of inferior quality compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the success of diffusion models can be partly attributed to the additional self-supervision information for their intermediate latent states provided by corrupted images, which along with the original image form a pseudo video. Based on this hypothesis, we explore the possibility of improving other types of generative models with such pseudo videos. Specifically, we first extend a given image generative model to their video generative model counterpart, and then train the video generative model on pseudo videos constructed by applying data augmentation to the original images. Furthermore, we analyze the potential issues of first-order Markov data augmentation methods, which are typically used in diffusion models, and propose to use more expressive data augmentation to construct more useful information in pseudo videos. Our empirical results on the CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets demonstrate that improved image generation quality can be achieved with additional self-supervised information from pseudo videos.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

After pre-training on enormous unlabeled data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a zeroth-order informed fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The zeroth-order gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with the lower variance than other methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of the RLR. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation tasks to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked Generative Nested Transformers with Decode Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00382v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in visual generation have made significant strides in producing content of exceptional quality. However, most methods suffer from a fundamental problem - a bottleneck of inference computational efficiency. Most of these algorithms involve multiple passes over a transformer model to generate tokens or denoise inputs. However, the model size is kept consistent throughout all iterations, which makes it computationally expensive. In this work, we aim to address this issue primarily through two key ideas - (a) not all parts of the generation process need equal compute, and we design a decode time model scaling schedule to utilize compute effectively, and (b) we can cache and reuse some of the computation. Combining these two ideas leads to using smaller models to process more tokens while large models process fewer tokens. These different-sized models do not increase the parameter size, as they share parameters. We rigorously experiment with ImageNet256$\times$256 , UCF101, and Kinetics600 to showcase the efficacy of the proposed method for image/video generation and frame prediction. Our experiments show that with almost $3\times$ less compute than baseline, our model obtains competitive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shape from Semantics: 3D Shape Generation from Multi-View Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00360v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose ``Shape from Semantics'', which is able to create 3D models whose geometry and appearance match given semantics when observed from different views. Traditional ``Shape from X'' tasks usually use visual input (e.g., RGB images or depth maps) to reconstruct geometry, imposing strict constraints that limit creative explorations. As applications, works like Shadow Art and Wire Art often struggle to grasp the embedded semantics of their design through direct observation and rely heavily on specific setups for proper display. To address these limitations, our framework uses semantics as input, greatly expanding the design space to create objects that integrate multiple semantic elements and are easily discernible by observers. Considering that this task requires a rich imagination, we adopt various generative models and structure-to-detail pipelines. Specifically, we adopt multi-semantics Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill 3D geometry and appearance from 2D diffusion models, ensuring that the initial shape is consistent with the semantic input. We then use image restoration and video generation models to add more details as supervision. Finally, we introduce neural signed distance field (SDF) representation to achieve detailed shape reconstruction. Our framework generates meshes with complex details, well-structured geometry, coherent textures, and smooth transitions, resulting in visually appealing and eye-catching designs.

Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some quantity on the goodness of the content. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward, at inference time. We then point out that the improvement of perceptual video quality considering the alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. When evaluating outputs by using vision language models as a proxy of humans, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with evaluation and also depend on the degree of dynamic descriptions in evaluation prompts. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality based on the calibrated reward, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling. We provide practical guidelines on which axes, among search budget, lookahead steps for reward estimate, and denoising steps, in the reverse diffusion process, we should allocate the inference-time computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://sites.google.com/view/t2v-dlbs</p></details> |

Specifically, our CSVR consists of three branches: a generative pose prediction branch, a discriminative context matching branch, and a video generating branch. Among them, the first one encodes dynamic motion feature by utilizing Conditional-GAN to predict the human poses of future frames, and the second branch extracts static context features by contrasting positive and negative video feature and I-frame feature pairs. The third branch is designed to generate both current and future video frames, for the purpose of collaboratively improving dynamic motion features and static context features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple popular video datasets.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has largely emphasized generic video generation guided by text, music-driven dance video generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MuseDance, an innovative end-to-end model that animates reference images using both music and text inputs. This dual input enables MuseDance to generate personalized videos that follow text descriptions and synchronize character movements with the music. Unlike existing approaches, MuseDance eliminates the need for complex motion guidance inputs, such as pose or depth sequences, making flexible and creative video generation accessible to users of all expertise levels. To advance research in this field, we present a new multimodal dataset comprising 2,904 dance videos with corresponding background music and text descriptions. Our approach leverages diffusion-based methods to achieve robust generalization, precise control, and temporal consistency, setting a new baseline for the music-driven image animation task.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Active Region Video Diffusion for Universal Policies (ARDuP), a novel framework for video-based policy learning that emphasizes the generation of active regions, i.e. potential interaction areas, enhancing the conditional policy's focus on interactive areas critical for task execution. This innovative framework integrates active region conditioning with latent diffusion models for video planning and employs latent representations for direct action decoding during inverse dynamic modeling. By utilizing motion cues in videos for automatic active region discovery, our method eliminates the need for manual annotations of active regions. We validate ARDuP's efficacy via extensive experiments on simulator CLIPort and the real-world dataset BridgeData v2, achieving notable improvements in success rates and generating convincingly realistic video plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2024 (Oral)</p></details> |

Our method is founded on the observation that attention difference in the diffusion process exhibits a U-shaped pattern, indicating significant redundancy. We mitigate this by broadcasting attention outputs to subsequent steps in a pyramid style. It applies different broadcast strategies to each attention based on their variance for best efficiency. We further introduce broadcast sequence parallel for more efficient distributed inference. PAB demonstrates up to 10.5x speedup across three models compared to baselines, achieving real-time generation for up to 720p videos. We anticipate that our simple yet effective method will serve as a robust baseline and facilitate future research and application for video generation.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, the computational demands of diffusion models pose significant challenges, particularly in generating high-resolution videos with high frame rates. In this paper, we propose CascadeV, a cascaded latent diffusion model (LDM), that is capable of producing state-of-the-art 2K resolution videos. Experiments demonstrate that our cascaded model achieves a higher compression ratio, substantially reducing the computational challenges associated with high-quality video generation. We also implement a spatiotemporal alternating grid 3D attention mechanism, which effectively integrates spatial and temporal information, ensuring superior consistency across the generated video frames. Furthermore, our model can be cascaded with existing T2V models, theoretically enabling a 4$\times$ increase in resolution or frames per second without any fine-tuning.

However, like other AIGC types, video generation requires robust content control. A common approach is to embed watermarks, but most research has focused on images, with limited attention given to videos. Traditional methods, which embed watermarks frame-by-frame in a post-processing manner, often degrade video quality. In this paper, we propose VideoShield, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for popular diffusion-based video generation models. Unlike post-processing methods, VideoShield embeds watermarks directly during video generation, eliminating the need for additional training. To ensure video integrity, we introduce a tamper localization feature that can detect changes both temporally (across frames) and spatially (within individual frames). Our method maps watermark bits to template bits, which are then used to generate watermarked noise during the denoising process. Using DDIM Inversion, we can reverse the video to its original watermarked noise, enabling straightforward watermark extraction. Additionally, template bits allow precise detection for potential temporal and spatial modification. Extensive experiments across various video models (both T2V and I2V models) demonstrate that our method effectively extracts watermarks and detects tamper without compromising video quality. Furthermore, we show that this approach is applicable to image generation models, enabling tamper detection in generated images as well.

In this work, we develop a systematic pipeline that harnesses human feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation model. Specifically, we begin by constructing a large-scale human preference dataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise annotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, a multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models by extending those from diffusion models. These include two training-time strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom weights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video quality needs.

However, existing methods struggle with "copy-paste" artifacts and low similarity issues, primarily due to their reliance on low-level facial image information. This dependence can result in rigid facial appearances and artifacts reflecting irrelevant details. To address these challenges, we propose EchoVideo, which employs two key strategies: (1) an Identity Image-Text Fusion Module (IITF) that integrates high-level semantic features from text, capturing clean facial identity representations while discarding occlusions, poses, and lighting variations to avoid the introduction of artifacts; (2) a two-stage training strategy, incorporating a stochastic method in the second phase to randomly utilize shallow facial information. The objective is to balance the enhancements in fidelity provided by shallow features while mitigating excessive reliance on them. This strategy encourages the model to utilize high-level features during training, ultimately fostering a more robust representation of facial identities. EchoVideo effectively preserves facial identities and maintains full-body integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves excellent results in generating high-quality, controllability and fidelity videos.</p></details> |  |

However, it suffers from temporal inconsistency in videos, hindering its practical applications. Various methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue by leveraging video generation models or introducing priors from optical flow and camera poses. Nonetheless, these methods are only applicable to short videos (< 10 seconds) and require a trade-off between quality and computational efficiency. We propose Video Depth Anything for high-quality, consistent depth estimation in super-long videos (over several minutes) without sacrificing efficiency. We base our model on Depth Anything V2 and replace its head with an efficient spatial-temporal head. We design a straightforward yet effective temporal consistency loss by constraining the temporal depth gradient, eliminating the need for additional geometric priors. The model is trained on a joint dataset of video depth and unlabeled images, similar to Depth Anything V2. Moreover, a novel key-frame-based strategy is developed for long video inference. Experiments show that our model can be applied to arbitrarily long videos without compromising quality, consistency, or generalization ability. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video depth estimation. We offer models of different scales to support a range of scenarios, with our smallest model capable of real-time performance at 30 FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://videodepthanything.github.io/</p></details> |

However, generating RGBA video, which includes alpha channels for transparency, remains a challenge due to limited datasets and the difficulty of adapting existing models. Alpha channels are crucial for visual effects (VFX), allowing transparent elements like smoke and reflections to blend seamlessly into scenes. We introduce TransPixeler, a method to extend pretrained video models for RGBA generation while retaining the original RGB capabilities. TransPixar leverages a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, incorporating alpha-specific tokens and using LoRA-based fine-tuning to jointly generate RGB and alpha channels with high consistency. By optimizing attention mechanisms, TransPixar preserves the strengths of the original RGB model and achieves strong alignment between RGB and alpha channels despite limited training data.

This issue underscores the urgent need for effective AI-generated video detectors to prevent the dissemination of false information through such videos. However, the development of high-performance generative video detectors is currently impeded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets specifically designed for generative video detection. To this end, we introduce GenVidBench, a challenging AI-generated video detection dataset with several key advantages: 1) Cross Source and Cross Generator: The cross-generation source mitigates the interference of video content on the detection. The cross-generator ensures diversity in video attributes between the training and test sets, preventing them from being overly similar. 2) State-of-the-Art Video Generators: The dataset includes videos from 8 state-of-the-art AI video generators, ensuring that it covers the latest advancements in the field of video generation. 3) Rich Semantics: The videos in GenVidBench are analyzed from multiple dimensions and classified into various semantic categories based on their content. This classification ensures that the dataset is not only large but also diverse, aiding in the development of more generalized and effective detection models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different advanced video generators and present a challenging setting. Additionally, we present rich experimental results including advanced video classification models as baselines.

Unlike existing methods that focus on generating full-body or half-body poses, we investigate the challenges of co-speech gesture generation and identify the weak correspondence between audio features and full-body gestures as a key limitation. To address this, we redefine the task as a two-stage process. In the first stage, we generate hand poses directly from audio input, leveraging the strong correlation between audio signals and hand movements. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion model to synthesize video frames, incorporating the hand poses generated in the first stage to produce realistic facial expressions and body movements. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, such as CyberHost and Vlogger, in terms of both visual quality and synchronization accuracy. This work provides a new perspective on audio-driven gesture generation and a robust framework for creating expressive and natural talking head animations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce LayerAnimate, a novel architectural approach that enhances fine-grained control over individual animation layers within a video diffusion model, allowing users to independently manipulate foreground and background elements in distinct layers. To address the challenge of limited layer-specific data, we propose a data curation pipeline that features automated element segmentation, motion-state hierarchical merging, and motion coherence refinement. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, and user study, we demonstrate that LayerAnimate outperforms current methods in terms of animation quality, control precision, and usability, making it an ideal tool for both professional animators and amateur enthusiasts. This framework opens up new possibilities for layer-specific animation applications and creative flexibility.

However, the leading video generation models remain closed-source, resulting in a notable performance gap between industry capabilities and those available to the public. In this report, we introduce HunyuanVideo, an innovative open-source video foundation model that demonstrates performance in video generation comparable to, or even surpassing, that of leading closed-source models. HunyuanVideo encompasses a comprehensive framework that integrates several key elements, including data curation, advanced architectural design, progressive model scaling and training, and an efficient infrastructure tailored for large-scale model training and inference. As a result, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13 billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. We conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to ensure high visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced filming techniques. According to evaluations by professionals, HunyuanVideo outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6, and three top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code for the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source communities. This initiative will empower individuals within the community to experiment with their ideas, fostering a more dynamic and vibrant video generation ecosystem.

| **[DiffuEraser: A Diffusion Model for Video Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10018v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video inpainting algorithms integrate flow-based pixel propagation with transformer-based generation to leverage optical flow for restoring textures and objects using information from neighboring frames, while completing masked regions through visual Transformers. However, these approaches often encounter blurring and temporal inconsistencies when dealing with large masks, highlighting the need for models with enhanced generative capabilities. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a prominent technique in image and video generation due to their impressive performance. In this paper, we introduce DiffuEraser, a video inpainting model based on stable diffusion, designed to fill masked regions with greater details and more coherent structures. We incorporate prior information to provide initialization and weak conditioning,which helps mitigate noisy artifacts and suppress hallucinations. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency during long-sequence inference, we expand the temporal receptive fields of both the prior model and DiffuEraser, and further enhance consistency by leveraging the temporal smoothing property of Video Diffusion Models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both content completeness and temporal consistency while maintaining acceptable efficiency.</p></details> | 11pages, 13figures |

We develop VideoWorld, an auto-regressive video generation model trained on unlabeled video data, and test its knowledge acquisition abilities in video-based Go and robotic control tasks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) video-only training provides sufficient information for learning knowledge, including rules, reasoning and planning capabilities, and (2) the representation of visual change is crucial for knowledge acquisition. To improve both the efficiency and efficacy of this process, we introduce the Latent Dynamics Model (LDM) as a key component of VideoWorld. Remarkably, VideoWorld reaches a 5-dan professional level in the Video-GoBench with just a 300-million-parameter model, without relying on search algorithms or reward mechanisms typical in reinforcement learning. In robotic tasks, VideoWorld effectively learns diverse control operations and generalizes across environments, approaching the performance of oracle models in CALVIN and RLBench. This study opens new avenues for knowledge acquisition from visual data, with all code, data, and models open-sourced for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are released at: https://maverickren.github.io/VideoWorld.github.io/</p></details> |

| **[Diffusion Models without Classifier-free Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12154v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Model-guidance (MG), a novel objective for training diffusion model that addresses and removes of the commonly used Classifier-free guidance (CFG). Our innovative approach transcends the standard modeling of solely data distribution to incorporating the posterior probability of conditions. The proposed technique originates from the idea of CFG and is easy yet effective, making it a plug-and-play module for existing models. Our method significantly accelerates the training process, doubles the inference speed, and achieve exceptional quality that parallel and even surpass concurrent diffusion models with CFG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, scalability on different models and datasets. Finally, we establish state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet 256 benchmarks with an FID of 1.34. Our code is available at https://github.com/tzco/Diffusion-wo-CFG.</p></details> |  |

Existing RL-based fine-tuning methods focus on single training timesteps and neglect trajectory-level alignment, while recent sampling trajectory optimization methods incur significant inference NFE costs. Diffusion-Sharpening overcomes this by using a path integral framework to select optimal trajectories during training, leveraging reward feedback, and amortizing inference costs. Our method demonstrates superior training efficiency with faster convergence, and best inference efficiency without requiring additional NFEs. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion-Sharpening outperforms RL-based fine-tuning methods (e.g., Diffusion-DPO) and sampling trajectory optimization methods (e.g., Inference Scaling) across diverse metrics including text alignment, compositional capabilities, and human preferences, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future diffusion model fine-tuning.

| **[How compositional generalization and creativity improve as diffusion models are trained](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12089v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural data is often organized as a hierarchical composition of features. How many samples do generative models need to learn the composition rules, so as to produce a combinatorial number of novel data? What signal in the data is exploited to learn? We investigate these questions both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we consider diffusion models trained on simple probabilistic context-free grammars - tree-like graphical models used to represent the structure of data such as language and images. We demonstrate that diffusion models learn compositional rules with the sample complexity required for clustering features with statistically similar context, a process similar to the word2vec algorithm. However, this clustering emerges hierarchically: higher-level, more abstract features associated with longer contexts require more data to be identified. This mechanism leads to a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the said context size. As a result, diffusion models trained on intermediate dataset size generate data coherent up to a certain scale, but that lacks global coherence. We test these predictions in different domains, and find remarkable agreement: both generated texts and images achieve progressively larger coherence lengths as the training time or dataset size grows. We discuss connections between the hierarchical clustering mechanism we introduce here and the renormalization group in physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[HumanGif: Single-View Human Diffusion with Generative Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12080v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While previous single-view-based 3D human reconstruction methods made significant progress in novel view synthesis, it remains a challenge to synthesize both view-consistent and pose-consistent results for animatable human avatars from a single image input. Motivated by the success of 2D character animation, we propose <strong>HumanGif</strong>, a single-view human diffusion model with generative prior. Specifically, we formulate the single-view-based 3D human novel view and pose synthesis as a single-view-conditioned human diffusion process, utilizing generative priors from foundational diffusion models. To ensure fine-grained and consistent novel view and pose synthesis, we introduce a Human NeRF module in HumanGif to learn spatially aligned features from the input image, implicitly capturing the relative camera and human pose transformation. Furthermore, we introduce an image-level loss during optimization to bridge the gap between latent and image spaces in diffusion models. Extensive experiments on RenderPeople and DNA-Rendering datasets demonstrate that HumanGif achieves the best perceptual performance, with better generalizability for novel view and pose synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://skhu101.github.io/HumanGif/</p></details> |

While recent studies show potential in removing these domain-specific factors, performance remains suboptimal. In this work, we introduce DiTTo-TTS, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based TTS model, to investigate whether LDM-based TTS can achieve state-of-the-art performance without domain-specific factors. Through rigorous analysis and empirical exploration, we find that (1) DiT with minimal modifications outperforms U-Net, (2) variable-length modeling with a speech length predictor significantly improves results over fixed-length approaches, and (3) conditions like semantic alignment in speech latent representations are key to further enhancement. By scaling our training data to 82K hours and the model size to 790M parameters, we achieve superior or comparable zero-shot performance to state-of-the-art TTS models in naturalness, intelligibility, and speaker similarity, all without relying on domain-specific factors. Speech samples are available at https://ditto-tts.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Given the challenge to public trust in media posed by photorealistic AI-generated images, we conducted a large-scale experiment measuring human detection accuracy on 450 diffusion-model generated images and 149 real images. Based on collecting 749,828 observations and 34,675 comments from 50,444 participants, we find that scene complexity of an image, artifact types within an image, display time of an image, and human curation of AI-generated images all play significant roles in how accurately people distinguish real from AI-generated images. Additionally, we propose a taxonomy characterizing artifacts often appearing in images generated by diffusion models. Our empirical observations and taxonomy offer nuanced insights into the capabilities and limitations of diffusion models to generate photorealistic images in 2024.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 24 Figures, Accepted by ACM CHI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Image Inversion: A Survey from GANs to Diffusion and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11974v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image inversion is a fundamental task in generative models, aiming to map images back to their latent representations to enable downstream applications such as editing, restoration, and style transfer. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in image inversion techniques, focusing on two main paradigms: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion and diffusion model inversion. We categorize these techniques based on their optimization methods. For GAN inversion, we systematically classify existing methods into encoder-based approaches, latent optimization approaches, and hybrid approaches, analyzing their theoretical foundations, technical innovations, and practical trade-offs. For diffusion model inversion, we explore training-free strategies, fine-tuning methods, and the design of additional trainable modules, highlighting their unique advantages and limitations. Additionally, we discuss several popular downstream applications and emerging applications beyond image tasks, identifying current challenges and future research directions. By synthesizing the latest developments, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a valuable reference resource, promoting further advancements in the field of image inversion.

| **[Path Planning for Masked Diffusion Model Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03540v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore how token unmasking order influences generative quality in masked diffusion models (MDMs). We derive an expanded evidence lower bound (ELBO) that introduces a planner to select which tokens to unmask at each step. Our analysis reveals that alternative unmasking strategies can enhance generation performance. Building on this, we propose Path Planning (P2), a sampling framework that uses a pre-trained BERT model or the denoiser itself to guide unmasking decisions. P2 generalizes all known MDM sampling strategies and significantly improves performance across diverse domains, including language generation (in-context learning, code generation, story infilling, mathematical reasoning, reverse curse correction) and biological sequence generation (protein and RNA sequences).</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Domain Augmentation for Autonomous Driving Testing Using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13661v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing is widely used to assess the reliability of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), but its effectiveness is limited by the operational design domain (ODD) conditions available in such simulators. To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then perform system-level testing to evaluate the ADS's generalization ability to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help increase the ODD coverage for system-level testing of ADS. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3%, retaining the correctness and quality of the generated images for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025).

| **[Debiasing Guidance for Discrete Diffusion with Sequential Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06079v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models are a class of generative models that produce samples from an approximated data distribution within a discrete state space. Often, there is a need to target specific regions of the data distribution. Current guidance methods aim to sample from a distribution with mass proportional to $p_0(x_0) p(\zeta|x_0)^\alpha$ but fail to achieve this in practice. We introduce a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that generates unbiasedly from this target distribution, utilising the learnt unconditional and guided process. We validate our approach on low-dimensional distributions, controlled images and text generations. For text generation, our method provides strong control while maintaining low perplexity compared to guidance-based approaches.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Neural Guided Diffusion Bridges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11909v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method for simulating conditioned diffusion processes (diffusion bridges) in Euclidean spaces. By training a neural network to approximate bridge dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for computationally intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods or reverse-process modeling. Compared to existing methods, it offers greater robustness across various diffusion specifications and conditioning scenarios. This applies in particular to rare events and multimodal distributions, which pose challenges for score-learning- and MCMC-based approaches. We propose a flexible variational family for approximating the diffusion bridge path measure which is partially specified by a neural network. Once trained, it enables efficient independent sampling at a cost comparable to sampling the unconditioned (forward) process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximating a spatially-heterogeneously mass-emitting object by multiple point sources in a diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11908v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various biological cells secrete diffusing chemical compounds into their environment for communication purposes. Secretion usually takes place over the cell membrane in a spatially heterogeneous manner. Mathematical models of these processes will be part of more elaborate models, e.g. of the movement of immune cells that react to cytokines in their environment. Here, we compare two approaches to modelling of the secretion-diffusion process of signalling compounds. The first is the so-called spatial exclusion model, in which the intracellular space is excluded from consideration and the computational space is the extracellular environment. The second consists of point source models, where the secreting cell is replaced by one or more non-spatial point sources or sinks, using -- mathematically -- Dirac delta distributions. We propose a multi-Dirac approach and provide explicit expressions for the intensities of the Dirac distributions. We show that two to three well-positioned Dirac points suffice to approximate well a temporally constant but spatially heterogeneous flux distribution of compound over the cell membrane, for a wide range of variation in flux density and diffusivity. The multi-Dirac approach is compared to a single-Dirac approach that was studied in previous work. Moreover, an explicit Green's function approach is introduced that has significant benefits in circumventing numerical instability that may occur when the Dirac sources have high intensities.</p></details> |  |
| **[BackdoorDM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Backdoor Learning in Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11798v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor learning is a critical research topic for understanding the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks. While it has been extensively studied in discriminative models over the past few years, backdoor learning in diffusion models (DMs) has recently attracted increasing attention, becoming a new research hotspot. Although many different backdoor attack and defense methods have been proposed for DMs, a comprehensive benchmark for backdoor learning in DMs is still lacking. This absence makes it difficult to conduct fair comparisons and thoroughly evaluate existing approaches, thus hindering future research progress. To address this issue, we propose BackdoorDM, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for backdoor learning in DMs. It comprises nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods, four SOTA defense strategies, and two helpful visualization analysis tools. We first systematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a unified framework, focusing on three different backdoor attack types and five backdoor target types, which are restricted to a single type in discriminative models. Then, we systematically summarize the evaluation metrics for each type and propose a unified backdoor evaluation method based on GPT-4o. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and highlight several important conclusions. We believe that BackdoorDM will help overcome current barriers and contribute to building a trustworthy DMs community. The codes are released in https://github.com/linweiii/BackdoorDM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Discretize Denoising Diffusion ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15506v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) are generative models showing competitive performance in various domains, including image synthesis and 3D point cloud generation. Sampling from pre-trained DPMs involves multiple neural function evaluations (NFEs) to transform Gaussian noise samples into images, resulting in higher computational costs compared to single-step generative models such as GANs or VAEs. Therefore, reducing the number of NFEs while preserving generation quality is crucial. To address this, we propose LD3, a lightweight framework designed to learn the optimal time discretization for sampling. LD3 can be combined with various samplers and consistently improves generation quality without having to retrain resource-intensive neural networks. We demonstrate analytically and empirically that LD3 improves sampling efficiency with much less computational overhead. We evaluate our method with extensive experiments on 7 pre-trained models, covering unconditional and conditional sampling in both pixel-space and latent-space DPMs. We achieve FIDs of 2.38 (10 NFE), and 2.27 (10 NFE) on unconditional CIFAR10 and AFHQv2 in 5-10 minutes of training. LD3 offers an efficient approach to sampling from pre-trained diffusion models. Code is available at https://github.com/vinhsuhi/LD3.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional [MASK] Discrete Diffusion Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06438v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although auto-regressive models excel in natural language processing, they often struggle to generate diverse text and provide limited controllability. Non-auto-regressive methods could be an alternative but often produce degenerate outputs and exhibit shortcomings in conditional generation. To address these challenges, we propose Diffusion-EAGS, a novel framework that integrates conditional masked language models into diffusion language models through the theoretical lens of a conditional Markov Random Field. In doing so, we propose entropy-adaptive Gibbs sampling and entropy-based noise scheduling to counterbalance each model's shortcomings. Experimental results show that Diffusion-EAGS outperforms baselines and achieves the best quality-diversity tradeoff, demonstrating its effectiveness in non-autoregressive text generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Autoregression: Discrete Diffusion for Complex Reasoning and Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14157v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive language models, despite their impressive capabilities, struggle with complex reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We introduce discrete diffusion models as a novel solution to these challenges. Through the lens of subgoal imbalance, we demonstrate how diffusion models effectively learn difficult subgoals that elude autoregressive approaches. We propose Multi-granularity Diffusion Modeling (MDM), which prioritizes subgoals based on difficulty during learning. On complex tasks like Countdown, Sudoku, and Boolean Satisfiability Problems, MDM significantly outperforms autoregressive models without using search techniques. For instance, MDM achieves 91.5\% and 100\% accuracy on Countdown and Sudoku, respectively, compared to 45.8\% and 20.7\% for autoregressive models. Our work highlights the potential of diffusion-based approaches in advancing AI capabilities for sophisticated language understanding and problem-solving tasks.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While existing training-based watermarking methods show promise, they often struggle with generalizing across diverse prompts and tend to introduce visible artifacts. To this end, we propose a novel, provably generalizable image watermarking approach for Latent Diffusion Models, termed Self-Augmented Training (SAT-LDM). Our method aligns the training and testing phases through a free generation distribution, thereby enhancing the watermarking module's generalization capabilities. We theoretically consolidate SAT-LDM by proving that the free generation distribution contributes to its tight generalization bound, without the need for additional data collection. Extensive experiments show that SAT-LDM not only achieves robust watermarking but also significantly improves the quality of watermarked images across a wide range of prompts. Moreover, our experimental analyses confirm the strong generalization abilities of SAT-LDM. We hope that our method provides a practical and efficient solution for securing high-fidelity AI-generated content.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

This paper investigates the possibility of inferring if a set of face images was used for fine-tuning a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) method is presented for this task. Using generated auxiliary data for the training of the attack model leads to significantly better performance, and so does the use of watermarks. The guidance scale used for inference was found to have a significant influence. If a LDM is fine-tuned for long enough, the text prompt used for inference has no significant influence. The proposed MIA is found to be viable in a realistic black-box setup against LDMs fine-tuned on face-images.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 20th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications (VISIGRAPP 2025) - Volume 2: VISAPP, pages 439-446</p></details> |

While the Gaussian policy performs well on simpler tasks, its exploration capacity and potential performance in complex multi-goal RL environments are limited by its inherent unimodality. In this paper, we employ the diffusion model, a powerful generative model capable of capturing complex multimodal distributions, as the policy representation to fulfill the MaxEnt RL objective, developing a method named MaxEnt RL with Diffusion Policy (MaxEntDP). Our method enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Experimental results on Mujoco benchmarks show that MaxEntDP outperforms the Gaussian policy and other generative models within the MaxEnt RL framework, and performs comparably to other state-of-the-art diffusion-based online RL algorithms.

The controllability challenges include generating a motion of a length that matches the given textual description and editing the generated motions according to control signals, such as the start-end positions and the pelvis trajectory. In this paper, we propose MoLA, which provides fast, high-quality, variable-length motion generation and can also deal with multiple editing tasks in a single framework. Our approach revisits the motion representation used as inputs and outputs in the model, incorporating an activation variable to enable variable-length motion generation. Additionally, we integrate a variational autoencoder and a latent diffusion model, further enhanced through adversarial training, to achieve high-quality and fast generation. Moreover, we apply a training-free guided generation framework to achieve various editing tasks with motion control inputs. We quantitatively show the effectiveness of adversarial learning in text-to-motion generation, and demonstrate the applicability of our editing framework to multiple editing tasks in the motion domain.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Continuous Diffusion Model for Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11564v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models in modeling discrete categorical data. Yet diffusion models that directly work on discrete data space do not fully exploit the power of iterative refinement, as the signals are lost during the transition between discrete states. Existing continuous diffusion models for discrete data have limited performance compared to discrete approaches, and the unclear link between them restricts the development of diffusion models for discrete data. In this work, we propose a continuous diffusion model for language modeling that incorporates the geometry of the underlying categorical distribution. We establish a connection between the discrete diffusion and continuous flow on the statistical manifold, and building on the analogy, we introduce a simple design for the diffusion process that generalizes previous discrete diffusion models. We further propose a simulation-free training framework based on radial symmetry and a simple technique to address the high dimensionality of the manifold. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks and other modalities show that our method outperforms existing discrete diffusion models and approaches the performance of autoregressive models.

Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Specifically, model-generated images may exhibit not safe for work (NSFW) content and style copyright infringements. The prompts that result in these problems often do not include explicit unsafe words; instead, they contain obscure and associative terms, which are referred to as implicit unsafe prompts. Existing approaches directly fine-tune models under textual guidance to alter the cognition of the diffusion model, thereby erasing inappropriate concepts. This not only requires concept-specific fine-tuning but may also incur catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we explore the representation of inappropriate concepts in the image space and guide them towards more suitable ones by injecting growth inhibitors, which are tailored based on the identified features related to inappropriate concepts during the diffusion process. Additionally, due to the varying degrees and scopes of inappropriate concepts, we train an adapter to infer the corresponding suppression scale during the injection process. Our method effectively captures the manifestation of subtle words at the image level, enabling direct and efficient erasure of target concepts without the need for fine-tuning. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves superior erasure results with little effect on other concepts while preserving image quality and semantics.</p></details> |  |
| **[SayAnything: Audio-Driven Lip Synchronization with Conditional Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11515v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have led to significant progress in audio-driven lip synchronization. However, existing methods typically rely on constrained audio-visual alignment priors or multi-stage learning of intermediate representations to force lip motion synthesis. This leads to complex training pipelines and limited motion naturalness. In this paper, we present SayAnything, a conditional video diffusion framework that directly synthesizes lip movements from audio input while preserving speaker identity. Specifically, we propose three specialized modules including identity preservation module, audio guidance module, and editing control module. Our novel design effectively balances different condition signals in the latent space, enabling precise control over appearance, motion, and region-specific generation without requiring additional supervision signals or intermediate representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SayAnything generates highly realistic videos with improved lip-teeth coherence, enabling unseen characters to say anything, while effectively generalizing to animated characters.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated a strong ability to capture the underlying modes of data distributions. In this paper, we harness the power of a Diffusion Autoencoder to generate multiple distinct counterfactual explanations. By clustering in the latent space, we uncover the directions corresponding to the different modes within a class, enabling the generation of diverse and meaningful counterfactuals. We introduce a novel methodology, DifCluE, which consistently identifies these modes and produces more reliable counterfactual explanations. Our experimental results demonstrate that DifCluE outperforms the current state-of-the-art in generating multiple counterfactual explanations, offering a significant advance- ment in model interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient-vDiT: Efficient Video Diffusion Transformers With Attention Tile](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06155v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the promise of synthesizing high-fidelity videos, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention suffer from expensive inference due to the complexity of attention computation and numerous sampling steps. For example, the popular Open-Sora-Plan model consumes more than 9 minutes for generating a single video of 29 frames. This paper addresses the inefficiency issue from two aspects: 1) Prune the 3D full attention based on the redundancy within video data; We identify a prevalent tile-style repetitive pattern in the 3D attention maps for video data, and advocate a new family of sparse 3D attention that holds a linear complexity w.r.t. the number of video frames. 2) Shorten the sampling process by adopting existing multi-step consistency distillation; We split the entire sampling trajectory into several segments and perform consistency distillation within each one to activate few-step generation capacities. We further devise a three-stage training pipeline to conjoin the low-complexity attention and few-step generation capacities. Notably, with 0.1% pretraining data, we turn the Open-Sora-Plan-1.2 model into an efficient one that is 7.4x -7.8x faster for 29 and 93 frames 720p video generation with a marginal performance trade-off in VBench. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach is amenable to distributed inference, achieving an additional 3.91x speedup when running on 4 GPUs with sequence parallelism.</p></details> |  |

We present a conditional encoder designed to adapt an image-to-video model for large-motion frame interpolation. To enhance performance, we integrate a dual-branch feature extractor and propose a cross-frame attention mechanism that effectively captures both spatial and temporal information, enabling accurate interpolations of intermediate frames. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on the Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) metric when evaluated against other state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in handling large motion scenarios, highlighting advancements in generative-based methodologies.</p></details> |  |

This work focuses on training-free guidance addressing challenges from non-differentiable objectives and discrete data distributions. We propose an algorithmic framework TreeG: Tree Search-Based Path Steering Guidance, applicable to both continuous and discrete settings in diffusion and flow models. TreeG offers a unified perspective on training-free guidance: proposing candidates for the next step, evaluating candidates, and selecting the best to move forward, enhanced by a tree search mechanism over active paths or parallelizing exploration. We comprehensively investigate the design space of TreeG over the candidate proposal module and the evaluation function, instantiating TreeG into three novel algorithms. Our experiments show that TreeG consistently outperforms the top guidance baselines in symbolic music generation, small molecule generation, and enhancer DNA design, all of which involve non-differentiable challenges. Additionally, we identify an inference-time scaling law showing TreeG's scalability in inference-time computation.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion-EXR corrupts the sequence of review embeddings by incrementally introducing varied levels of Gaussian noise to the sequence of word embeddings and learns to reconstruct the original word representations in the reverse process. The nature of DDPM enables our lightweight Transformer backbone to perform excellently in the recommendation review generation task.

| **[Hiding and Recovering Knowledge in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Learnable Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12326v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capability in generating high-quality visual content from textual descriptions. However, since these models are trained on large-scale internet data, they inevitably learn undesirable concepts, such as sensitive content, copyrighted material, and harmful or unethical elements. While previous works focus on permanently removing such concepts, this approach is often impractical, as it can degrade model performance and lead to irreversible loss of information. In this work, we introduce a novel concept-hiding approach that makes unwanted concepts inaccessible to public users while allowing controlled recovery when needed. Instead of erasing knowledge from the model entirely, we incorporate a learnable prompt into the cross-attention module, acting as a secure memory that suppresses the generation of hidden concepts unless a secret key is provided. This enables flexible access control -- ensuring that undesirable content cannot be easily generated while preserving the option to reinstate it under restricted conditions. Our method introduces a new paradigm where concept suppression and controlled recovery coexist, which was not feasible in prior works. We validate its effectiveness on the Stable Diffusion model, demonstrating that hiding concepts mitigate the risks of permanent removal while maintaining the model's overall capability.</p></details> |  |

Tackling these biases is crucial in improving model generalization and trust, especially in real-world scenarios. This paper presents Diffusing DeBias (DDB), a novel approach acting as a plug-in for common methods in model debiasing while exploiting the inherent bias-learning tendency of diffusion models. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic bias-aligned images, used to train a bias amplifier model, to be further employed as an auxiliary method in different unsupervised debiasing approaches. Our proposed method, which also tackles the common issue of training set memorization typical of this type of tech- niques, beats current state-of-the-art in multiple benchmark datasets by significant margins, demonstrating its potential as a versatile and effective tool for tackling dataset bias in deep learning applications.</p></details> | 29 Pages, 12 Figures |
| **[A Survey on Diffusion Models for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11430v4)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative AI models, showing remarkable potential in anomaly detection (AD) tasks across various domains, such as cybersecurity, fraud detection, healthcare, and manufacturing. The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models.

| **[EC-DIT: Scaling Diffusion Transformers with Adaptive Expert-Choice Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02098v3)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers have been widely adopted for text-to-image synthesis. While scaling these models up to billions of parameters shows promise, the effectiveness of scaling beyond current sizes remains underexplored and challenging. By explicitly exploiting the computational heterogeneity of image generations, we develop a new family of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models (EC-DIT) for diffusion transformers with expert-choice routing. EC-DIT learns to adaptively optimize the compute allocated to understand the input texts and generate the respective image patches, enabling heterogeneous computation aligned with varying text-image complexities. This heterogeneity provides an efficient way of scaling EC-DIT up to 97 billion parameters and achieving significant improvements in training convergence, text-to-image alignment, and overall generation quality over dense models and conventional MoE models. Through extensive ablations, we show that EC-DIT demonstrates superior scalability and adaptive compute allocation by recognizing varying textual importance through end-to-end training. Notably, in text-to-image alignment evaluation, our largest models achieve a state-of-the-art GenEval score of 71.68% and still maintain competitive inference speed with intuitive interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Previous Steps: A Training-free Fast Solver for Flow Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07627v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow diffusion models (FDMs) have recently shown potential in generation tasks due to the high generation quality. However, the current ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still suffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function evaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a novel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality generation. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous steps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from the previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to approximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor expansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial interpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could approximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that the flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation speed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, LSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency of the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from 13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Church, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Our approach reduces the residual error by up to two orders of magnitude compared to previous work in a fluid flow case study and outperforms task-specific frameworks in relevant metrics for structural topology optimization.

We demonstrate via a motivating example, sampling from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean, the powerfulness of our approach. In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm. Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information. This approach yields the best known convergence rate for our sampling algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted version in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |
| **[Low-Rank Continual Personalization of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04891v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent personalization methods for diffusion models, such as Dreambooth and LoRA, allow fine-tuning pre-trained models to generate new concepts. However, applying these techniques across consecutive tasks in order to include, e.g., new objects or styles, leads to a forgetting of previous knowledge due to mutual interference between their adapters. In this work, we tackle the problem of continual customization under a rigorous regime with no access to past tasks' adapters. In such a scenario, we investigate how different adapters' initialization and merging methods can improve the quality of the final model. To that end, we evaluate the naive continual fine-tuning of customized models and compare this approach with three methods for consecutive adapters' training: sequentially merging new adapters, merging orthogonally initialized adapters, and updating only relevant task-specific weights. In our experiments, we show that the proposed techniques mitigate forgetting when compared to the naive approach. In our studies, we show different traits of selected techniques and their effect on the plasticity and stability of the continually adapted model.

| **[Mask Approximation Net: A Novel Diffusion Model Approach for Remote Sensing Change Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19179v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image change description represents an innovative multimodal task within the realm of remote sensing processing. This task not only facilitates the detection of alterations in surface conditions, but also provides comprehensive descriptions of these changes, thereby improving human interpretability and interactivity.Generally, existing deep-learning-based methods predominantly utilized a three-stage framework that successively perform feature extraction, feature fusion, and localization from bitemporal images before text generation. However, this reliance often leads to an excessive focus on the design of specific network architectures and restricts the feature distributions to the dataset at hand, which in turn results in limited generalizability and robustness during application.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach for remote sensing image change detection and description that incorporates diffusion models, aiming to transition the emphasis of modeling paradigms from conventional feature learning to data distribution learning. The proposed method primarily includes a simple multi-scale change detection module, whose output features are subsequently refined by an well-designed diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a frequency-guided complex filter module to boost the model performance by managing high-frequency noise throughout the diffusion process. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method across several datasets for remote sensing change detection and description, showcasing its superior performance compared to existing techniques. The code will be available at \href{https://github.com/sundongwei}{MaskApproxNet} after a possible publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Reference Lighting Estimation Diffusion Model for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02879v3)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion model-based low-light image enhancement methods rely heavily on paired training data, leading to limited extensive application. Meanwhile, existing unsupervised methods lack effective bridging capabilities for unknown degradation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-reference lighting estimation diffusion model for low-light image enhancement called Zero-LED. It utilizes the stable convergence ability of diffusion models to bridge the gap between low-light domains and real normal-light domains and successfully alleviates the dependence on pairwise training data via zero-reference learning. Specifically, we first design the initial optimization network to preprocess the input image and implement bidirectional constraints between the diffusion model and the initial optimization network through multiple objective functions. Subsequently, the degradation factors of the real-world scene are optimized iteratively to achieve effective light enhancement. In addition, we explore a frequency-domain based and semantically guided appearance reconstruction module that encourages feature alignment of the recovered image at a fine-grained level and satisfies subjective expectations. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach to other state-of-the-art methods and more significant generalization capabilities. We will open the source code upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

However, developing expressive generative models for tabular data is challenging due to its inherent heterogeneous data types, complex inter-correlations, and intricate column-wise distributions. In this paper, we introduce TabDiff, a joint diffusion framework that models all mixed-type distributions of tabular data in one model. Our key innovation is the development of a joint continuous-time diffusion process for numerical and categorical data, where we propose feature-wise learnable diffusion processes to counter the high disparity of different feature distributions. TabDiff is parameterized by a transformer handling different input types, and the entire framework can be efficiently optimized in an end-to-end fashion. We further introduce a mixed-type stochastic sampler to automatically correct the accumulated decoding error during sampling, and propose classifier-free guidance for conditional missing column value imputation. Comprehensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate that TabDiff achieves superior average performance over existing competitive baselines across all eight metrics, with up to $22.5\%$ improvement over the state-of-the-art model on pair-wise column correlation estimations.

| **[Collaborative Deterministic-Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Urban Spatiotemporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11013v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of urban spatiotemporal dynamics is essential for enhancing urban management and decision-making. Existing spatiotemporal prediction models are predominantly deterministic, focusing on primary spatiotemporal patterns. However, those dynamics are highly complex, exhibiting multi-modal distributions that are challenging for deterministic models to capture. In this paper, we highlight the critical role of probabilistic prediction in capturing the uncertainties and complexities inherent in spatiotemporal data. While mainstream probabilistic models can capture uncertainty, they struggle with accurately learning primary patterns and often suffer from computational inefficiency. To address these challenges, we propose CoST, which collaborates deterministic and probabilistic models to improve both predictive accuracy and the ability to handle uncertainty. To achieve this, we design a mean-residual decomposition framework, where the mean value is modeled by a deterministic model, and the residual variations are learned by a probabilistic model, specifically diffusion models. Moreover, we introduce a scale-aware diffusion process, which better accounts for spatially heterogeneous dynamics across different regions. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that CoST significantly outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic metrics, achieving a 20% improvement with low computational cost. CoST bridges the gap between deterministic precision and probabilistic uncertainty, making a significant advancement in the field of urban spatiotemporal prediction.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we re-evaluate the necessity of additional modules and analyze how to improve training efficiency and reduce redundant steps in the inference process. Based on these insights, we propose CatVTON, a simple and efficient virtual try-on diffusion model that transfers in-shop or worn garments of arbitrary categories to target individuals by concatenating them along spatial dimensions as inputs of the diffusion model. The efficiency of CatVTON is reflected in three aspects: (1) Lightweight network. CatVTON consists only of a VAE and a simplified denoising UNet, removing redundant image and text encoders as well as cross-attentions, and includes just 899.06M parameters. (2) Parameter-efficient training. Through experimental analysis, we identify self-attention modules as crucial for adapting pre-trained diffusion models to the virtual try-on task, enabling high-quality results with only 49.57M training parameters. (3) Simplified inference. CatVTON eliminates unnecessary preprocessing, such as pose estimation, human parsing, and captioning, requiring only a person image and garment reference to guide the virtual try-on process, reducing over 49% memory usage compared to other diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CatVTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results compared to baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalization performance in in-the-wild scenarios, despite being trained solely on public datasets with 73K samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in video prediction; however, existing models frequently produce blurry results and exhibit reduced accuracy when forecasting physical fields. Here, we introduce SATcast, a diffusion model that leverages a cascade architecture and multimodal inputs for nowcasting cloud fields in satellite imagery. SATcast incorporates physical fields predicted by FuXi, a deep-learning weather model, alongside past satellite observations as conditional inputs to generate high-quality future cloud fields. Through comprehensive evaluation, SATcast outperforms conventional methods on multiple metrics, demonstrating its superior accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies underscore the importance of its multimodal design and the cascade architecture in achieving reliable predictions. Notably, SATcast maintains predictive skill for up to 24 hours, underscoring its potential for operational nowcasting applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel denoising strategy inspired by the structure of the MSE-optimal conditional mean estimator (CME). The resulting DM-based denoiser can be conveniently employed using a pre-trained DM, being particularly fast by truncating reverse diffusion steps and not requiring stochastic re-sampling. We present a comprehensive (non-)asymptotic optimality analysis of the proposed diffusion-based denoiser, demonstrating polynomial-time convergence to the CME under mild conditions. Our analysis also derives a novel Lipschitz constant that depends solely on the DM's hyperparameters. Further, we offer a new perspective on DMs, showing that they inherently combine an asymptotically optimal denoiser with a powerful generator, modifiable by switching re-sampling in the reverse process on or off. The theoretical findings are thoroughly validated with experiments based on various benchmark datasets</p></details> |  |

Existing methodologies still encounter issues, including identity distortion, background instability, and unrealistic facial dynamics, particularly in head-only animation scenarios. Besides, extending to accommodate diverse body proportions usually leads to visual inconsistencies or unnatural articulations. To address these challenges, SkyReels-A1 capitalizes on the strong generative capabilities of video DiT, enhancing facial motion transfer precision, identity retention, and temporal coherence. The system incorporates an expression-aware conditioning module that enables seamless video synthesis driven by expression-guided landmark inputs. Integrating the facial image-text alignment module strengthens the fusion of facial attributes with motion trajectories, reinforcing identity preservation. Additionally, SkyReels-A1 incorporates a multi-stage training paradigm to incrementally refine the correlation between expressions and motion while ensuring stable identity reproduction. Extensive empirical evaluations highlight the model's ability to produce visually coherent and compositionally diverse results, making it highly applicable to domains such as virtual avatars, remote communication, and digital media generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffQRCoder: Diffusion-based Aesthetic QR Code Generation with Scanning Robustness Guided Iterative Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06355v3)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the success of Diffusion Models for image generation, the technologies also have revolutionized the aesthetic Quick Response (QR) code generation. Despite significant improvements in visual attractiveness for the beautified codes, their scannabilities are usually sacrificed and thus hinder their practical uses in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel training-free Diffusion-based QR Code generator (DiffQRCoder) to effectively craft both scannable and visually pleasing QR codes. The proposed approach introduces Scanning-Robust Perceptual Guidance (SRPG), a new diffusion guidance for Diffusion Models to guarantee the generated aesthetic codes to obey the ground-truth QR codes while maintaining their attractiveness during the denoising process. Additionally, we present another post-processing technique, Scanning Robust Manifold Projected Gradient Descent (SR-MPGD), to further enhance their scanning robustness through iterative latent space optimization. With extensive experiments, the results demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms other compared methods in Scanning Success Rate (SSR) with better or comparable CLIP aesthetic score (CLIP-aes.) but also significantly improves the SSR of the ControlNet-only approach from 60% to 99%. The subjective evaluation indicates that our approach achieves promising visual attractiveness to users as well. Finally, even with different scanning angles and the most rigorous error tolerance settings, our approach robustly achieves over 95% SSR, demonstrating its capability for real-world applications.

However, the ease of text-based image editing introduces significant risks, such as malicious editing for scams or intellectual property infringement. Previous works have attempted to safeguard images from diffusion-based editing by adding imperceptible perturbations. These methods are costly and specifically target prevalent Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), while Pixel-domain Diffusion Models (PDMs) remain largely unexplored and robust against such attacks. Our work addresses this gap by proposing a novel attack framework, AtkPDM. AtkPDM is mainly composed of a feature representation attacking loss that exploits vulnerabilities in denoising UNets and a latent optimization strategy to enhance the naturalness of adversarial images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in attacking dominant PDM-based editing methods (e.g., SDEdit) while maintaining reasonable fidelity and robustness against common defense methods. Additionally, our framework is extensible to LDMs, achieving comparable performance to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Due to the inherent complexity of these tasks, acquiring sufficient demonstration data and training policies that generalize to unseen scenarios remain a largely unresolved challenge. Building on recent advances in planning through contacts, we introduce Generalizable Planning-Guided Diffusion Policy Learning (GLIDE), an approach that effectively learns to solve contact-rich bimanual manipulation tasks by leveraging model-based motion planners to generate demonstration data in high-fidelity physics simulation. Through efficient planning in randomized environments, our approach generates large-scale and high-quality synthetic motion trajectories for tasks involving diverse objects and transformations. We then train a task-conditioned diffusion policy via behavior cloning using these demonstrations. To tackle the sim-to-real gap, we propose a set of essential design options in feature extraction, task representation, action prediction, and data augmentation that enable learning robust prediction of smooth action sequences and generalization to unseen scenarios. Through experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that our approach can enable a bimanual robotic system to effectively manipulate objects of diverse geometries, dimensions, and physical properties.

| **[Towards a Mechanistic Explanation of Diffusion Model Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19339v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a simple, training-free mechanism which explains the generalization behaviour of diffusion models. By comparing pre-trained diffusion models to their theoretically optimal empirical counterparts, we identify a shared local inductive bias across a variety of network architectures. From this observation, we hypothesize that network denoisers generalize through localized denoising operations, as these operations approximate the training objective well over much of the training distribution. To validate our hypothesis, we introduce novel denoising algorithms which aggregate local empirical denoisers to replicate network behaviour. Comparing these algorithms to network denoisers across forward and reverse diffusion processes, our approach exhibits consistent visual similarity to neural network outputs, with lower mean squared error than previously proposed methods.</p></details> | 24 pages, 23 figures |
| **[Region-Adaptive Sampling for Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10389v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have become the leading choice for generative tasks across diverse domains. However, their reliance on multiple sequential forward passes significantly limits real-time performance. Previous acceleration methods have primarily focused on reducing the number of sampling steps or reusing intermediate results, failing to leverage variations across spatial regions within the image due to the constraints of convolutional U-Net structures. By harnessing the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in handling variable number of tokens, we introduce RAS, a novel, training-free sampling strategy that dynamically assigns different sampling ratios to regions within an image based on the focus of the DiT model. Our key observation is that during each sampling step, the model concentrates on semantically meaningful regions, and these areas of focus exhibit strong continuity across consecutive steps. Leveraging this insight, RAS updates only the regions currently in focus, while other regions are updated using cached noise from the previous step. The model's focus is determined based on the output from the preceding step, capitalizing on the temporal consistency we observed. We evaluate RAS on Stable Diffusion 3 and Lumina-Next-T2I, achieving speedups up to 2.36x and 2.51x, respectively, with minimal degradation in generation quality. Additionally, a user study reveals that RAS delivers comparable qualities under human evaluation while achieving a 1.6x speedup. Our approach makes a significant step towards more efficient diffusion transformers, enhancing their potential for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimension-free Score Matching and Time Bootstrapping for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10354v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models generate samples by estimating the score function of the target distribution at various noise levels. The model is trained using samples drawn from the target distribution, progressively adding noise. In this work, we establish the first (nearly) dimension-free sample complexity bounds for learning these score functions, achieving a double exponential improvement in dimension over prior results. A key aspect of our analysis is the use of a single function approximator to jointly estimate scores across noise levels, a critical feature of diffusion models in practice which enables generalization across timesteps. Our analysis introduces a novel martingale-based error decomposition and sharp variance bounds, enabling efficient learning from dependent data generated by Markov processes, which may be of independent interest. Building on these insights, we propose Bootstrapped Score Matching (BSM), a variance reduction technique that utilizes previously learned scores to improve accuracy at higher noise levels. These results provide crucial insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion models for generative modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiOpt: Self-supervised Diffusion for Constrained Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10330v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models show promising potential for learning-based optimization by leveraging their multimodal sampling capability to escape local optima. However, existing diffusion-based optimization approaches, often reliant on supervised training, lacks a mechanism to ensure strict constraint satisfaction which is often required in real-world applications. One resulting observation is the distributional misalignment, i.e. the generated solution distribution often exhibits small overlap with the feasible domain. In this paper, we propose DiOpt, a novel diffusion paradigm that systematically learns near-optimal feasible solution distributions through iterative self-training. Our framework introduces several key innovations: a target distribution specifically designed to maximize overlap with the constrained solution manifold; a bootstrapped self-training mechanism that adaptively weights candidate solutions based on the severity of constraint violations and optimality gaps; and a dynamic memory buffer that accelerates convergence by retaining high-quality solutions over training iterations. To our knowledge, DiOpt represents the first successful integration of self-supervised diffusion with hard constraint satisfaction. Evaluations on diverse tasks, including power grid control, motion retargeting, wireless allocation demonstrate its superiority in terms of both optimality and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalised Parallel Tempering: Flexible Replica Exchange via Flows and Diffusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10328v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parallel Tempering (PT) is a classical MCMC algorithm designed for leveraging parallel computation to sample efficiently from high-dimensional, multimodal or otherwise complex distributions via annealing. One limitation of the standard formulation of PT is the growth of computational resources required to generate high-quality samples, as measured by effective sample size or round trip rate, for increasingly challenging distributions. To address this issue, we propose the framework: Generalised Parallel Tempering (GePT) which allows for the incorporation of recent advances in modern generative modelling, such as normalising flows and diffusion models, within Parallel Tempering, while maintaining the same theoretical guarantees as MCMC-based methods. For instance, we show that this allows us to utilise diffusion models in a parallelised manner, bypassing the usual computational cost of a large number of steps to generate quality samples. Further, we empirically demonstrate that GePT can improve sample quality and reduce the growth of computational resources required to handle complex distributions over the classical algorithm.</p></details> |  |

However, this advancement raises significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and the potential misuse of generated content. Current watermarking techniques employed in LDMs often embed constant signals to the generated images that compromise their stealthiness, making them vulnerable to detection by malicious attackers. In this paper, we introduce SWA-LDM, a novel approach that enhances watermarking by randomizing the embedding process, effectively eliminating detectable patterns while preserving image quality and robustness. Our proposed watermark presence attack reveals the inherent vulnerabilities of existing latent-based watermarking methods, demonstrating how easily these can be exposed. Through comprehensive experiments, we validate that SWA-LDM not only fortifies watermark stealthiness but also maintains competitive performance in watermark robustness and visual fidelity. This work represents a pivotal step towards securing LDM-generated images against unauthorized use, ensuring both copyright protection and content integrity in an era where digital image authenticity is paramount.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. For topologically structured data, we devise a frequency-based noising operator to purposefully manipulate, and set, these inductive biases. We first show that appropriate manipulations of the noising forward process can lead DPMs to focus on particular aspects of the distribution to learn. We show that different datasets necessitate different inductive biases, and that appropriate frequency-based noise control induces increased generative performance compared to standard diffusion. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of ignoring information at particular frequencies while learning. We show this in an image corruption and recovery task, where we train a DPM to recover the original target distribution after severe noise corruption.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-order finite element methods for three-dimensional multicomponent convection-diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17390v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive and analyze a broad class of finite element methods for numerically simulating the stationary, low Reynolds number flow of concentrated mixtures of several distinct chemical species in a common thermodynamic phase. The underlying partial differential equations that we discretize are the Stokes$\unicode{x2013}$Onsager$\unicode{x2013}$Stefan$\unicode{x2013}$Maxwell (SOSM) equations, which model bulk momentum transport and multicomponent diffusion within ideal and non-ideal mixtures. Unlike previous approaches, the methods are straightforward to implement in two and three spatial dimensions, and allow for high-order finite element spaces to be employed. The key idea in deriving the discretization is to suitably reformulate the SOSM equations in terms of the species mass fluxes and chemical potentials, and discretize these unknown fields using stable $H(\textrm{div}) \unicode{x2013} L^2$ finite element pairs. We prove that the methods are convergent and yield a symmetric linear system for a Picard linearization of the SOSM equations, which staggers the updates for concentrations and chemical potentials. We also discuss how the proposed approach can be extended to the Newton linearization of the SOSM equations, which requires the simultaneous solution of mole fractions, chemical potentials, and other variables. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments and we present an example of a physical application involving the microfluidic non-ideal mixing of hydrocarbons.</p></details> |  |

However, meeting the computation-intensive and latency-sensitive demands of vehicles remains challenging due to the energy constraints and dynamic environments. To address this issue, we study an IRS-assisted MEC architecture for vehicular networks. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem aimed at minimizing the total task completion delay and total energy consumption by jointly optimizing task offloading, IRS phase shift vector, and computation resource allocation. Given the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) and NP-hard nature of the problem, we propose a generative diffusion model (GDM)-based Stackelberg game (GDMSG) approach. Specifically, the problem is reformulated within a Stackelberg game framework, where generative GDM is integrated to capture complex dynamics to efficiently derive optimal solutions. Simulation results indicate that the proposed GDMSG achieves outstanding performance compared to the benchmark approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, published to ICC</p></details> |

Nevertheless, SemCom is sensitive to wireless channel uncertainties, source outliers, and suffer from poor generalization bottlenecks. To address the mentioned challenges, this paper develops a latent diffusion model-enabled SemCom system with three key contributions, i.e., i) to handle potential outliers in the source data, semantic errors obtained by projected gradient descent based on the vulnerabilities of DL models, are utilized to update the parameters and obtain an outlier-robust encoder, ii) a lightweight single-layer latent space transformation adapter completes one-shot learning at the transmitter and is placed before the decoder at the receiver, enabling adaptation for out-of-distribution data and enhancing human-perceptual quality, and iii) an end-to-end consistency distillation (EECD) strategy is used to distill the diffusion models trained in latent space, enabling deterministic single or few-step low-latency denoising in various noisy channels while maintaining high semantic quality. Extensive numerical experiments across different datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SemCom system, consistently proving its robustness to outliers, the capability to transmit data with unknown distributions, and the ability to perform real-time channel denoising tasks while preserving high human perceptual quality, outperforming the existing denoising approaches in semantic metrics such as multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) and learned perceptual image path similarity (LPIPS).</p></details> |  |
| **[DiTAR: Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling for Speech Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03930v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy for Long-horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10040v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have advanced robot imitation learning, but high data collection costs and limited demonstrations hinder generalization and current imitation learning methods struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios, especially for long-horizon tasks. A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09992v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models (ARMs) are widely regarded as the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data masking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer to predict masked tokens. By optimizing a likelihood bound, it provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as a viable and promising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM capabilities discussed above are inherently tied to ARMs.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the application of RSI in text-to-image diffusion models, addressing the challenge of training collapse caused by synthetic data. We identify two key factors contributing to this collapse: the lack of perceptual alignment and the accumulation of generative hallucinations. To mitigate these issues, we propose three strategies: (1) a prompt construction and filtering pipeline designed to facilitate the generation of perceptual aligned data, (2) a preference sampling method to identify human-preferred samples and filter out generative hallucinations, and (3) a distribution-based weighting scheme to penalize selected samples with hallucinatory errors. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of these approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Personalized Content Synthesis with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05538v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models have significantly impacted content creation, leading to the emergence of Personalized Content Synthesis (PCS). With a small set of user-provided examples, PCS aims to customize the subject of interest to specific user-defined prompts. Over the past two years, more than 150 methods have been proposed. However, existing surveys mainly focus on text-to-image generation, with few providing up-to-date summaries on PCS. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of PCS, with a particular focus on the diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce the generic frameworks of PCS research, which can be broadly classified into optimization-based and learning-based approaches. We further categorize and analyze these methodologies, discussing their strengths, limitations, and key techniques. Additionally, we delve into specialized tasks within the field, such as personalized object generation, face synthesis, and style personalization, highlighting their unique challenges and innovations. Despite encouraging progress, we also present an analysis of the challenges such as overfitting and the trade-off between subject fidelity and text alignment. Through this detailed overview and analysis, we propose future directions to advance the development of PCS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precise Parameter Localization for Textual Generation in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09935v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel diffusion models can synthesize photo-realistic images with integrated high-quality text. Surprisingly, we demonstrate through attention activation patching that only less than 1% of diffusion models' parameters, all contained in attention layers, influence the generation of textual content within the images. Building on this observation, we improve textual generation efficiency and performance by targeting cross and joint attention layers of diffusion models. We introduce several applications that benefit from localizing the layers responsible for textual content generation. We first show that a LoRA-based fine-tuning solely of the localized layers enhances, even more, the general text-generation capabilities of large diffusion models while preserving the quality and diversity of the diffusion models' generations. Then, we demonstrate how we can use the localized layers to edit textual content in generated images. Finally, we extend this idea to the practical use case of preventing the generation of toxic text in a cost-free manner. In contrast to prior work, our localization approach is broadly applicable across various diffusion model architectures, including U-Net (e.g., LDM and SDXL) and transformer-based (e.g., DeepFloyd IF and Stable Diffusion 3), utilizing diverse text encoders (e.g., from CLIP to the large language models like T5).

Traditional predict-then-act frameworks are often insufficient or inefficient because accurate inference of human behavior requires a continuous interaction rather than isolated prediction. To address this, we propose an active learning framework in which we rigorously derive predicted belief distributions. Additionally, we introduce a novel model-based diffusion solver tailored for online receding horizon control problems, demonstrated through a complex, non-convex highway merging scenario. Our approach extends previous high-fidelity dual control simulations to hardware experiments, which may be viewed at https://youtu.be/Q_JdZuopGL4, and verifies behavior inference in human-driven traffic scenarios, moving beyond idealized models. The results show improvements in adaptive planning under uncertainty, advancing the field of interactive decision-making for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetry-Preserving Diffusion Models via Target Symmetrization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09890v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are powerful tools for capturing complex distributions, but modeling data with inherent symmetries, such as molecular structures, remains challenging. Equivariant denoisers are commonly used to address this, but they introduce architectural complexity and optimization challenges, including noisy gradients and convergence issues. We propose a novel approach that enforces equivariance through a symmetrized loss function, which applies a time-dependent weighted averaging operation over group actions to the model's prediction target. This ensures equivariance without explicit architectural constraints and reduces gradient variance, leading to more stable and efficient optimization. Our method uses Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the average, incurring minimal computational overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees of equivariance for the minimizer of our loss function and demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic datasets and the molecular conformation generation task using the GEOM-QM9 dataset. Experiments show improved sample quality compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of our approach to enhance the scalability and practicality of equivariant diffusion models in generative tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compression-Aware One-Step Diffusion Model for JPEG Artifact Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09873v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image restoration tasks. However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/jp-guo/CODiff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning a Diffusion Model Policy from Rewards via Q-Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11752v5)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become a popular choice for representing actor policies in behavior cloning and offline reinforcement learning. This is due to their natural ability to optimize an expressive class of distributions over a continuous space. However, previous works fail to exploit the score-based structure of diffusion models, and instead utilize a simple behavior cloning term to train the actor, limiting their ability in the actor-critic setting. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework linking the structure of diffusion model policies to a learned Q-function, by linking the structure between the score of the policy to the action gradient of the Q-function. We focus on off-policy reinforcement learning and propose a new policy update method from this theory, which we denote Q-score matching. Notably, this algorithm only needs to differentiate through the denoising model rather than the entire diffusion model evaluation, and converged policies through Q-score matching are implicitly multi-modal and explorative in continuous domains. We conduct experiments in simulated environments to demonstrate the viability of our proposed method and compare to popular baselines.

To tackle this, we present ArchComplete, a two-stage voxel-based 3D generative pipeline consisting of a vector-quantised model, whose composition is modelled with an autoregressive transformer for generating coarse shapes, followed by a hierarchical upsampling strategy for further enrichment with fine structures and details. Key to our pipeline is (i) learning a contextually rich codebook of local patch embeddings, optimised alongside a 2.5D perceptual loss that captures global spatial correspondence of projections onto three axis-aligned orthogonal planes, and (ii) redefining upsampling as a set of conditional diffusion models learning from a hierarchy of randomly cropped coarse-to-fine local volumetric patches. Trained on our introduced dataset of 3D house models with fully modelled exterior and interior, ArchComplete autoregressively generates models at the resolution of $64^{3}$ and progressively refines them up to $512^{3}$, with voxel sizes as small as $ \approx 9\text{cm}$. ArchComplete solves a variety of tasks, including genetic interpolation and variation, unconditional synthesis, shape and plan-drawing completion, as well as geometric detailisation, while achieving state-of-the-art performance in quality, diversity, and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

In this work, we tackle the SBP in the case when $\mathbf{R}$ is the path measure of a jump diffusion. Under mild assumptions, with both the operator theory approach and the stochastic calculus techniques, we establish an $h$-transform theory for jump diffusions and devise an approximation method to achieve the jump-diffusion SBP solution $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ as the strong-convergence limit of a sequence of harmonic $h$-transforms. To the best of our knowledge, these results are novel in the study of SBP. Moreover, the $h$-transform framework and the approximation method developed in this work are robust and applicable to a relatively general class of jump diffusions. In addition, we examine the SBP of particular types of jump diffusions under additional regularity conditions and extend the existing results on the SBP from the diffusion case to the jump-diffusion setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Markovian Discrete Diffusion with Causal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09767v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a flexible and controllable paradigm for structured sequence modeling, yet they still lag behind causal language models in expressiveness. To bridge the gap between two paradigms, we introduce CaDDi, a causal discrete diffusion model that unifies sequential and temporal modeling within a non-Markovian diffusion framework. Unlike conventional diffusion models that operate step by step with no access to prior states, CaDDi integrates the temporal trajectory, enabling more expressive and controllable generation. Our approach also treats causal language models as a special case, allowing seamless adoption of pretrained large language models (LLMs) for discrete diffusion without the need for architectural modifications. Empirically, we demonstrate that CaDDi outperforms state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models on both natural language and biological sequence tasks, narrowing the gap between diffusion-based methods and large-scale autoregressive transformers.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Theoretical Benefit and Limitation of Diffusion Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09622v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation. One would naturally expect this method to be an efficient replacement for autoregressive models since multiple tokens can be sampled in parallel during each diffusion step. However, its efficiency-accuracy trade-off is not yet well understood. In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of a widely used type of diffusion language model, the Masked Diffusion Model (MDM), and find that its effectiveness heavily depends on the target evaluation metric. Under mild conditions, we prove that when using perplexity as the metric, MDMs can achieve near-optimal perplexity in sampling steps regardless of sequence length, demonstrating that efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing performance. However, when using the sequence error rate--which is important for understanding the "correctness" of a sequence, such as a reasoning chain--we show that the required sampling steps must scale linearly with sequence length to obtain "correct" sequences, thereby eliminating MDM's efficiency advantage over autoregressive models. Our analysis establishes the first theoretical foundation for understanding the benefits and limitations of MDMs. All theoretical findings are supported by empirical studies.</p></details> | 32 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Rolling Ahead Diffusion for Traffic Scene Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09587v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic driving simulation requires that NPCs not only mimic natural driving behaviors but also react to the behavior of other simulated agents. Recent developments in diffusion-based scenario generation focus on creating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios by jointly modelling the motion of all the agents in the scene. However, these traffic scenarios do not react when the motion of agents deviates from their modelled trajectories. For example, the ego-agent can be controlled by a stand along motion planner. To produce reactive scenarios with joint scenario models, the model must regenerate the scenario at each timestep based on new observations in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) fashion. Although reactive, this method is time-consuming, as one complete possible future for all NPCs is generated per simulation step. Alternatively, one can utilize an autoregressive model (AR) to predict only the immediate next-step future for all NPCs. Although faster, this method lacks the capability for advanced planning. We present a rolling diffusion based traffic scene generation model which mixes the benefits of both methods by predicting the next step future and simultaneously predicting partially noised further future steps at the same time. We show that such model is efficient compared to diffusion model based AR, achieving a beneficial compromise between reactivity and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Workshop on Machine Learning for Autonomous Driving at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional $\textit{de novo}$ generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on $\textit{de novo}$ molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Long-Term TalkingFace Generation via Motion-Prior Conditional Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09533v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in conditional diffusion models have shown promise for generating realistic TalkingFace videos, yet challenges persist in achieving consistent head movement, synchronized facial expressions, and accurate lip synchronization over extended generations. To address these, we introduce the \textbf{M}otion-priors \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{MCDM}), which utilizes both archived and current clip motion priors to enhance motion prediction and ensure temporal consistency. The model consists of three key elements: (1) an archived-clip motion-prior that incorporates historical frames and a reference frame to preserve identity and context; (2) a present-clip motion-prior diffusion model that captures multimodal causality for accurate predictions of head movements, lip sync, and expressions; and (3) a memory-efficient temporal attention mechanism that mitigates error accumulation by dynamically storing and updating motion features. We also release the \textbf{TalkingFace-Wild} dataset, a multilingual collection of over 200 hours of footage across 10 languages. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MCDM in maintaining identity and motion continuity for long-term TalkingFace generation. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models for Molecules: A Survey of Methods and Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09511v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative tasks about molecules, including but not limited to molecule generation, are crucial for drug discovery and material design, and have consistently attracted significant attention. In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as an impressive class of deep generative models, sparking extensive research and leading to numerous studies on their application to molecular generative tasks. Despite the proliferation of related work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this area. Particularly, due to the diversity of diffusion model formulations, molecular data modalities, and generative task types, the research landscape is challenging to navigate, hindering understanding and limiting the area's growth. To address this, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of diffusion model-based molecular generative methods. We systematically review the research from the perspectives of methodological formulations, data modalities, and task types, offering a novel taxonomy. This survey aims to facilitate understanding and further flourishing development in this area.

| **[Redistribute Ensemble Training for Mitigating Memorization in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09434v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, known for their tremendous ability to generate high-quality samples, have recently raised concerns due to their data memorization behavior, which poses privacy risks. Recent methods for memory mitigation have primarily addressed the issue within the context of the text modality in cross-modal generation tasks, restricting their applicability to specific conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for diffusion models from the perspective of visual modality, which is more generic and fundamental for mitigating memorization. Directly exposing visual data to the model increases memorization risk, so we design a framework where models learn through proxy model parameters instead. Specially, the training dataset is divided into multiple shards, with each shard training a proxy model, then aggregated to form the final model. Additionally, practical analysis of training losses illustrates that the losses for easily memorable images tend to be obviously lower. Thus, we skip the samples with abnormally low loss values from the current mini-batch to avoid memorizing. However, balancing the need to skip memorization-prone samples while maintaining sufficient training data for high-quality image generation presents a key challenge. Thus, we propose IET-AGC+, which redistributes highly memorizable samples between shards, to mitigate these samples from over-skipping. Furthermore, we dynamically augment samples based on their loss values to further reduce memorization. Extensive experiments and analysis on four datasets show that our method successfully reduces memory capacity while maintaining performance. Moreover, we fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion models, e.g., Stable Diffusion, and decrease the memorization score by 46.7\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in: https://github.com/liuxiao-guan/IET_AGC.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,9 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.15328</p></details> |
| **[Multicontinuum Modeling of Time-Fractional Diffusion-Wave Equation in Heterogeneous Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09428v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a time-fractional diffusion-wave equation with a high-contrast heterogeneous diffusion coefficient. A numerical solution to this problem can present great computational challenges due to its multiscale nature. Therefore, in this paper, we derive a multicontinuum time-fractional diffusion-wave model using the multicontinuum homogenization method. For this purpose, we formulate constraint cell problems considering various homogenized effects. These cell problems are implemented in oversampled regions to avoid boundary effects. By solving the cell problems, we obtain multicontinuum expansions of fine-scale solutions. Then, using these multicontinuum expansions and supposing the smoothness of the macroscopic variables, we rigorously derive the corresponding multicontinuum model. Finally, we present numerical results for two-dimensional model problems with different time-fractional derivatives to verify the accuracy of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADBM: Adversarial diffusion bridge model for reliable adversarial purification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00315v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently Diffusion-based Purification (DiffPure) has been recognized as an effective defense method against adversarial examples. However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Diffusion Transformer Policy: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15959v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large vision-language action models pretrained on diverse robot datasets have demonstrated the potential for generalizing to new environments with a few in-domain data. However, those approaches usually predict individual discretized or continuous action by a small action head, which limits the ability in handling diverse action spaces. In contrast, we model the continuous action sequence with a large multi-modal diffusion transformer, dubbed as Diffusion Transformer Policy, in which we directly denoise action chunks by a large transformer model rather than a small action head for action embedding. By leveraging the scaling capability of transformers, the proposed approach can effectively model continuous end-effector actions across large diverse robot datasets, and achieve better generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of Diffusion Transformer Policy on Maniskill2, Libero, Calvin and SimplerEnv, as well as the real-world Franka arm, achieving consistent better performance on Real-to-Sim benchmark SimplerEnv, real-world Franka Arm and Libero compared to OpenVLA and Octo. Specifically, without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a single third-view camera stream in the Calvin task ABC->D, improving the average number of tasks completed in a row of 5 to 3.6, and the pretraining stage significantly facilitates the success sequence length on the Calvin by over 1.2.

| **[An initial-corrected splitting approach for convection-diffusion-reaction problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09371v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Splitting methods constitute a well-established class of numerical schemes for solving convection-diffusion-reaction problems. They have been shown to be effective in solving problems with periodic boundary conditions. However, in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions, order reduction has been observed even with homogeneous boundary conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel splitting approach, the so-called `initial-corrected splitting method', which succeeds in overcoming order reduction. A convergence analysis is performed to demonstrate second-order convergence of this modified Strang splitting method. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the newly developed splitting approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-LAM: Probabilistic Limited Area Weather Forecasting with Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07532v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning methods have been shown to be effective for weather forecasting, based on the speed and accuracy compared to traditional numerical models. While early efforts primarily concentrated on deterministic predictions, the field has increasingly shifted toward probabilistic forecasting to better capture the forecast uncertainty. Most machine learning-based models have been designed for global-scale predictions, with only limited work targeting regional or limited area forecasting, which allows more specialized and flexible modeling for specific locations. This work introduces Diffusion-LAM, a probabilistic limited area weather model leveraging conditional diffusion. By conditioning on boundary data from surrounding regions, our approach generates forecasts within a defined area. Experimental results on the MEPS limited area dataset demonstrate the potential of Diffusion-LAM to deliver accurate probabilistic forecasts, highlighting its promise for limited-area weather prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Diffusion Network for Drug-Gene Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09335v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting drug-gene associations is crucial for drug development and disease treatment. While graph neural networks (GNN) have shown effectiveness in this task, they face challenges with data sparsity and efficient contrastive learning implementation. We introduce a graph diffusion network for drug-gene prediction (GDNDGP), a framework that addresses these limitations through two key innovations. First, it employs meta-path-based homogeneous graph learning to capture drug-drug and gene-gene relationships, ensuring similar entities share embedding spaces. Second, it incorporates a parallel diffusion network that generates hard negative samples during training, eliminating the need for exhaustive negative sample retrieval. Our model achieves superior performance on the DGIdb 4.0 dataset and demonstrates strong generalization capability on tripartite drug-gene-disease networks. Results show significant improvements over existing methods in drug-gene prediction tasks, particularly in handling complex heterogeneous relationships.

| **[Noise Matters: Diffusion Model-based Urban Mobility Generation with Collaborative Noise Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05000v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With global urbanization, the focus on sustainable cities has largely grown, driving research into equity, resilience, and urban planning, which often relies on mobility data. The rise of web-based apps and mobile devices has provided valuable user data for mobility-related research. However, real-world mobility data is costly and raises privacy concerns. To protect privacy while retaining key features of real-world movement, the demand for synthetic data has steadily increased. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown great potential for mobility trajectory generation due to their ability to model randomness and uncertainty. However, existing approaches often directly apply identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise sampling from image generation techniques, which fail to account for the spatiotemporal correlations and social interactions that shape urban mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose CoDiffMob, a diffusion model for urban mobility generation with collaborative noise priors, we emphasize the critical role of noise in diffusion models for generating mobility data. By leveraging both individual movement characteristics and population-wide dynamics, we construct novel collaborative noise priors that provide richer and more informative guidance throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, with generated data accurately capturing both individual preferences and collective patterns, achieving an improvement of over 32%. Furthermore, it can effectively replace web-derived mobility data to better support downstream applications, while safeguarding user privacy and fostering a more secure and ethical web. This highlights its tremendous potential for applications in sustainable city-related research. The code and data are available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CoDiffMob.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-asymptotic Analysis of Diffusion Annealed Langevin Monte Carlo for Generative Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09306v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the theoretical properties of general diffusion (interpolation) paths and their Langevin Monte Carlo implementation, referred to as diffusion annealed Langevin Monte Carlo (DALMC), under weak conditions on the data distribution. Specifically, we analyse and provide non-asymptotic error bounds for the annealed Langevin dynamics where the path of distributions is defined as Gaussian convolutions of the data distribution as in diffusion models. We then extend our results to recently proposed heavy-tailed (Student's t) diffusion paths, demonstrating their theoretical properties for heavy-tailed data distributions for the first time. Our analysis provides theoretical guarantees for a class of score-based generative models that interpolate between a simple distribution (Gaussian or Student's t) and the data distribution in finite time. This approach offers a broader perspective compared to standard score-based diffusion approaches, which are typically based on a forward Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noising process.</p></details> |  |
| **[E-MD3C: Taming Masked Diffusion Transformers for Efficient Zero-Shot Object Customization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09164v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose E-MD3C ($\underline{E}$fficient $\underline{M}$asked $\underline{D}$iffusion Transformer with Disentangled $\underline{C}$onditions and $\underline{C}$ompact $\underline{C}$ollector), a highly efficient framework for zero-shot object image customization. Unlike prior works reliant on resource-intensive Unet architectures, our approach employs lightweight masked diffusion transformers operating on latent patches, offering significantly improved computational efficiency. The framework integrates three core components: (1) an efficient masked diffusion transformer for processing autoencoder latents, (2) a disentangled condition design that ensures compactness while preserving background alignment and fine details, and (3) a learnable Conditions Collector that consolidates multiple inputs into a compact representation for efficient denoising and learning. E-MD3C outperforms the existing approach on the VITON-HD dataset across metrics such as PSNR, FID, SSIM, and LPIPS, demonstrating clear advantages in parameters, memory efficiency, and inference speed. With only $\frac{1}{4}$ of the parameters, our Transformer-based 468M model delivers $2.5\times$ faster inference and uses $\frac{2}{3}$ of the GPU memory compared to an 1720M Unet-based latent diffusion model.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Regularization can make diffusion models more efficient](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09151v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are one of the key architectures of generative AI. Their main drawback, however, is the computational costs. This study indicates that the concept of sparsity, well known especially in statistics, can provide a pathway to more efficient diffusion pipelines. Our mathematical guarantees prove that sparsity can reduce the input dimension's influence on the computational complexity to that of a much smaller intrinsic dimension of the data. Our empirical findings confirm that inducing sparsity can indeed lead to better samples at a lower cost.</p></details> |  |
