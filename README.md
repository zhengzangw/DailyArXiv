| **[StableAvatar: Infinite-Length Audio-Driven Avatar Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08248v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio, StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this, StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  |

Recent works utilize video model to achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation.

| **[S^2VG: 3D Stereoscopic and Spatial Video Generation via Denoising Frame Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08048v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video generation models excel at producing high-quality monocular videos, generating 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos for immersive applications remains an underexplored challenge. We present a pose-free and training-free method that leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video generation model to produce immersive 3D videos. Our approach first warps the generated monocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth information, then applies a novel \textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework. This framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize missing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial and temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning. Moreover, we develop a \dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from disoccluded areas in the latent space. The resulting multi-view videos are then adapted into stereoscopic pairs or optimized into 4D Gaussians for spatial video synthesis. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting experiments on videos from various generative models, such as Sora, Lumiere, WALT, and Zeroscope. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a significant improvement over previous methods.

| **[Omni-Effects: Unified and Spatially-Controllable Visual Effects Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07981v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges, we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts (LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference. (2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of desired effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stand-In: A Lightweight and Plug-and-Play Identity Control for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07901v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-fidelity human videos that match user-specified identities is important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation. Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just $\sim$1\% additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks, such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation, stylization, and face swapping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dream4D: Lifting Camera-Controlled I2V towards Spatiotemporally Consistent 4D Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07769v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The synthesis of spatiotemporally coherent 4D content presents fundamental challenges in computer vision, requiring simultaneous modeling of high-fidelity spatial representations and physically plausible temporal dynamics. Current approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural 4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture: it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wanderer7-sk.github.io/Dream4D.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ShoulderShot: Generating Over-the-Shoulder Dialogue Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07597v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over-the-shoulder dialogue videos are essential in films, short dramas, and advertisements, providing visual variety and enhancing viewers' emotional connection. Despite their importance, such dialogue scenes remain largely underexplored in video generation research. The main challenges include maintaining character consistency across different shots, creating a sense of spatial continuity, and generating long, multi-turn dialogues within limited computational budgets. Here, we present ShoulderShot, a framework that combines dual-shot generation with looping video, enabling extended dialogues while preserving character consistency. Our results demonstrate capabilities that surpass existing methods in terms of shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial continuity, and flexibility in dialogue length, thereby opening up new possibilities for practical dialogue video generation. Videos and comparisons are available at https://shouldershot.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[FancyVideo: Towards Dynamic and Consistent Video Generation via Cross-frame Textual Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08189v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing motion-rich and temporally consistent videos remains a challenge in artificial intelligence, especially when dealing with extended durations. Existing text-to-video (T2V) models commonly employ spatial cross-attention for text control, equivalently guiding different frame generations without frame-specific textual guidance. Thus, the model's capacity to comprehend the temporal logic conveyed in prompts and generate videos with coherent motion is restricted. To tackle this limitation, we introduce FancyVideo, an innovative video generator that improves the existing text-control mechanism with the well-designed Cross-frame Textual Guidance Module (CTGM). Specifically, CTGM incorporates the Temporal Information Injector (TII) and Temporal Affinity Refiner (TAR) at the beginning and end of cross-attention, respectively, to achieve frame-specific textual guidance. Firstly, TII injects frame-specific information from latent features into text conditions, thereby obtaining cross-frame textual conditions. Then, TAR refines the correlation matrix between cross-frame textual conditions and latent features along the time dimension. Extensive experiments comprising both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FancyVideo. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art T2V generation results on the EvalCrafter benchmark and facilitates the synthesis of dynamic and consistent videos. Note that the T2V process of FancyVideo essentially involves a text-to-image step followed by T+I2V. This means it also supports the generation of videos from user images, i.e., the image-to-video (I2V) task. A significant number of experiments have shown that its performance is also outstanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Video Signature: In-generation Watermarking for Latent Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00652v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has led to significant progress in video generation but also raises serious concerns about intellectual property protection and reliable content tracing. Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, but existing methods for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which introduces additional computational overhead and often fails to effectively balance the trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. To address these issues, we propose Video Signature (VIDSIG), an in-generation watermarking method for latent video diffusion models, which enables implicit and adaptive watermark integration during generation. Specifically, we achieve this by partially fine-tuning the latent decoder, where Perturbation-Aware Suppression (PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal consistency by introducing a lightweight Temporal Alignment module that guides the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning. Experimental results show that VIDSIG achieves the best overall performance in watermark extraction, visual quality, and generation efficiency. It also demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tampering, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/hardenyu21/Video-Signature}{here}</p></details> |  |
| **[Restage4D: Reanimating Deformable 3D Reconstruction from a Single Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06715v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating deformable 3D content has gained increasing attention with the rise of text-to-image and image-to-video generative models. While these models provide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the physical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis. In contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and articulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised: \textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the motion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of reanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original sequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We introduce \textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for video-conditioned 4D restaging. Our approach uses a video-rewinding training strategy to temporally bridge a real base video and a synthetic driving video via a shared motion representation. We further incorporate an occlusion-aware rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural and geometry consistency under challenging motion. We validate Restage4D on DAVIS and PointOdyssey, demonstrating improved geometry consistency, motion quality, and 3D tracking performance. Our method not only preserves deformable structure under novel motion, but also automatically corrects errors introduced by generative models, revealing the potential of video prior in 4D restaging task. Source code and trained models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating, Fast and Slow: Scalable Parallel Video Generation with Video Interface Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17539v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) can generate short photorealistic videos, yet directly training and sampling longer videos with full attention across the video remains computationally challenging. Alternative methods break long videos down into sequential generation of short video segments, requiring multiple sampling chain iterations and specialized consistency modules. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new paradigm called Video Interface Networks (VINs), which augment DiTs with an abstraction module to enable parallel inference of video chunks. At each diffusion step, VINs encode global semantics from the noisy input of local chunks and the encoded representations, in turn, guide DiTs in denoising chunks in parallel. The coupling of VIN and DiT is learned end-to-end on the denoising objective. Further, the VIN architecture maintains fixed-size encoding tokens that encode the input via a single cross-attention step. Disentangling the encoding tokens from the input thus enables VIN to scale to long videos and learn essential semantics. Experiments on VBench demonstrate that VINs surpass existing chunk-based methods in preserving background consistency and subject coherence. We then show via an optical flow analysis that our approach attains state-of-the-art motion smoothness while using 25-40% fewer FLOPs than full generation. Finally, human raters favorably assessed the overall video quality and temporal consistency of our method in a user study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Video Bi-flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06364v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel generative video model to robustly learn temporal change as a neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) flow with a bilinear objective which combines two aspects: The first is to map from the past into future video frames directly. Previous work has mapped the noise to new frames, a more computationally expensive process. Unfortunately, starting from the previous frame, instead of noise, is more prone to drifting errors. Hence, second, we additionally learn how to remove the accumulated errors as the joint objective by adding noise during training. We demonstrate unconditional video generation in a streaming manner for various video datasets, all at competitive quality compared to a conditional diffusion baseline but with higher speed, i.e., fewer ODE solver steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[SwiftVideo: A Unified Framework for Few-Step Video Generation through Trajectory-Distribution Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06082v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in few-step video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamVE: Unified Instruction-based Image and Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06080v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing, particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data, hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing. This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation, background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However, collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases. Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE. Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and editability. The codes and models will be released.</p></details> |  |

At its core, GE-Base is a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight, flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development. The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action alignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable and practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied intelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://genie-envisioner.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[S$^2$Q-VDiT: Accurate Quantized Video Diffusion Transformer with Salient Data and Sparse Token Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04016v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we propose S$^2$Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for V-DMs that leverages Salient data and Sparse token distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs. Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6 quantization, S$^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering $3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will be available at https://github.com/wlfeng0509/s2q-vdit.</p></details> |  |
| **[B4DL: A Benchmark for 4D LiDAR LLM in Spatio-Temporal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05269v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated dataset, and inference outputs on diverse scenarios at: https://mmb4dl.github.io/mmb4dl/</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[RIFLEx: A Free Lunch for Length Extrapolation in Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15894v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have enabled models to synthesize high-quality, minute-long videos. However, generating even longer videos with temporal coherence remains a major challenge and existing length extrapolation methods lead to temporal repetition or motion deceleration. In this work, we systematically analyze the role of frequency components in positional embeddings and identify an intrinsic frequency that primarily governs extrapolation behavior. Based on this insight, we propose RIFLEx, a minimal yet effective approach that reduces the intrinsic frequency to suppress repetition while preserving motion consistency, without requiring any additional modifications. RIFLEx offers a true free lunch--achieving high-quality 2x extrapolation on state-of-the-art video diffusion transformers in a completely training-free manner. Moreover, it enhances quality and enables 3x extrapolation by minimal fine-tuning without long videos.

| **[PoseGen: In-Context LoRA Finetuning for Pose-Controllable Long Human Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05091v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models, which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence. Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of unlimited duration.</p></details> |  |

To obtain the subgoals, existing methods typically resort to video generation models but suffer from model hallucination and computational cost. We present Vis2Plan, an efficient, explainable and white-box visual planning framework powered by symbolic guidance. From raw, unlabeled play data, Vis2Plan harnesses vision foundation models to automatically extract a compact set of task symbols, which allows building a high-level symbolic transition graph for multi-goal, multi-stage planning. At test time, given a desired task goal, our planner conducts planning at the symbolic level and assembles a sequence of physically consistent intermediate sub-goal images grounded by the underlying symbolic representation. Our Vis2Plan outperforms strong diffusion video generation-based visual planners by delivering 53\% higher aggregate success rate in real robot settings while generating visual plans 35$\times$ faster. The results indicate that Vis2Plan is able to generate physically consistent image goals while offering fully inspectable reasoning steps.</p></details> |  |

Our method leverages the universal visual-language mapping learned by video diffusion models on Internet-scale data by fine-tuning them on small-scale Referring Object Segmentation datasets. Our key insight is to preserve the entirety of the generative model's architecture by shifting its objective from predicting noise to predicting mask latents. The resulting model can accurately segment rare and unseen objects, despite only being trained on a limited set of categories. Additionally, it can effortlessly generalize to non-object dynamic concepts, such as smoke or raindrops, as demonstrated in our new benchmark for Referring Video Process Segmentation (Ref-VPS). REM performs on par with the state-of-the-art on in-domain datasets, like Ref-DAVIS, while outperforming them by up to 12 IoU points out-of-domain, leveraging the power of generative pre-training. We also show that advancements in video generation directly improve segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://refereverything.github.io/</p></details> |

We reveal a new class of cross-modality memorization where models trained on these tasks leak copyrighted content through indirect, phonetic pathways invisible to traditional text-based analysis. In this work, we introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), an attack that replaces iconic phrases with homophonic alternatives--e.g., "mom's spaghetti" becomes "Bob's confetti"--preserving the acoustic form while largely changing semantic content. We demonstrate that models can be prompted to regurgitate memorized songs using phonetically similar but semantically unrelated lyrics. Despite the semantic drift, black-box models like SUNO and open-source models like YuE generate outputs that are strikingly similar to the original songs--melodically, rhythmically, and vocally--achieving high scores on AudioJudge, CLAP, and CoverID. These effects persist across genres and languages. More surprisingly, we find that phonetic prompts alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models: when given altered lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 generates scenes that mirror the original music video--complete with a hooded rapper and dim urban settings--despite no explicit visual cues in the prompt. This cross-modality leakage represents an unprecedented threat: models memorize deep, structural patterns that transcend their training modality, making traditional safety measures like copyright filters ineffective. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in transcript-conditioned generative models and raise urgent concerns around copyright, provenance, and secure deployment of multimodal generation systems.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline.

While prior methods typically decouple appearance and motion training, the stage-wise strategy often introduces concept interference, resulting in inaccurate rendering of appearance features or motion patterns. Another challenge is appearance contamination, where background and foreground elements from reference videos distort the customized subject. In this work, we propose JointTuner, a novel framework that enables joint optimization of both appearance and motion components by leveraging two key innovations: Synaptic Low-Rank Adaptation (Synaptic LoRA) and Appearance-independent Temporal Loss (AiT Loss). Synaptic LoRA introduces a synaptic regulator, implemented as a context-aware linear activation layer, to dynamically guide LoRA modules to focus on either subject appearance or motion patterns, thereby enabling consistent optimization across spatial and temporal dimensions. AiT Loss disrupts the gradient flow of appearance-related components, guiding the model to focus exclusively on motion learning and minimizing appearance interference. JointTuner is compatible with both UNet-based models (e.g., ZeroScope) and Diffusion Transformer-based models (e.g., CogVideoX), supporting the generation of longer and higher-quality customized videos. Additionally, we present a systematic evaluation framework for appearance-motion combined customization, covering 90 combinations evaluated along four critical dimensions: semantic alignment, motion dynamism, temporal consistency, and perceptual quality.

This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of T2V-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-to-video outputs remain challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed T2VEval-Bench, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset for text-to-video quality evaluation, which contains 148 textual prompts and 1,783 videos generated by 13 T2V models. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we scored each video on four dimensions in the subjective experiment, which are overall impression, text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Based on T2VEval-Bench, we developed T2VEval, a multi-branch fusion scheme for T2V quality evaluation. T2VEval assesses videos across three branches: text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large language model. Additionally, we implemented a divide-and-conquer training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by DISPLAYS</p></details> |

However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types.

Most community models and datasets in the T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect, primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Our theoretical analysis indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL) for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning. Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments. Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms existing long video generation models in quality and stability.

We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable "choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Dual-Expert Consistency Model for Efficient and High-Quality Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03123v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models have achieved remarkable results in video synthesis but require iterative denoising steps, leading to substantial computational overhead. Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)}, where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert specialization in video diffusion model distillation.

| **[Scaling Up Audio-Synchronized Visual Animation: An Efficient Training Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03955v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[LongVie: Multimodal-Guided Controllable Ultra-Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03694v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency: 1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals, complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100 high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments, each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vchitect.github.io/LongVie-project/</p></details> |
| **[Individual Content and Motion Dynamics Preserved Pruning for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18375v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high computational cost and slow inference time are major obstacles to deploying Video Diffusion Models (VDMs). To overcome this, we introduce a new Video Diffusion Model Compression approach using individual content and motion dynamics preserved pruning and consistency loss. First, we empirically observe that deeper VDM layers are crucial for maintaining the quality of \textbf{motion dynamics} (\textit{e.g.,} coherence of the entire video), while shallower layers are more focused on \textbf{individual content} (\textit{e.g.,} individual frames). Therefore, we prune redundant blocks from the shallower layers while preserving more of the deeper layers, resulting in a lightweight VDM variant called VDMini. Moreover, we propose an \textbf{Individual Content and Motion Dynamics (ICMD)} Consistency Loss to gain comparable generation performance as larger VDM to VDMini. In particular, we first use the Individual Content Distillation (ICD) Loss to preserve the consistency in the features of each generated frame between the teacher and student models. Next, we introduce a Multi-frame Content Adversarial (MCA) Loss to enhance the motion dynamics across the generated video as a whole. This method significantly accelerates inference time while maintaining high-quality video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our VDMini on two important video generation tasks, Text-to-Video (T2V) and Image-to-Video (I2V), where we respectively achieve an average 2.5 $\times$, 1.4 $\times$, and 1.25 $\times$ speed up for the I2V method SF-V, the T2V method T2V-Turbo-v2, and the T2V method HunyuanVideo, while maintaining the quality of the generated videos on several benchmarks including UCF101, VBench-T2V, and VBench-I2V.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 |
| **[T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging powerful generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which tend to inadequately capture fine-grained motion details, leading to unrealistic or incoherent reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding (dubbed T-GVC), a novel framework that bridges low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding. T-GVC features a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline that extracts pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, significantly reducing the bitrate while preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by integrating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free guidance mechanism in latent space to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that T-GVC outperforms both traditional and neural video codecs under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our framework achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causally Steered Diffusion for Automated Video Counterfactual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14404v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models (LDMs) to video editing has shown strong visual fidelity and controllability, but challenges remain in maintaining causal relationships inherent to the video data generating process. Edits affecting causally dependent attributes often generate unrealistic or misleading outcomes if these relationships are ignored. In this work, we introduce a causally faithful framework for counterfactual video generation, formulated as an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) prediction problem. We embed prior causal knowledge by encoding the relationships specified in a causal graph into text prompts and guide the generation process by optimizing these prompts using a vision-language model (VLM)-based textual loss. This loss encourages the latent space of the LDMs to capture OOD variations in the form of counterfactuals, effectively steering generation toward causally meaningful alternatives. The proposed framework, dubbed CSVC, is agnostic to the underlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal mechanisms or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach using standard video quality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal effectiveness and minimality. Experimental results show that CSVC generates causally faithful video counterfactuals within the LDM distribution via prompt-based causal steering, achieving state-of-the-art causal effectiveness without compromising temporal consistency or visual quality on real-world facial videos. Due to its compatibility with any black-box video editing system, our framework has significant potential to generate realistic 'what if' hypothetical video scenarios in diverse areas such as digital media and healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[V.I.P. : Iterative Online Preference Distillation for Efficient Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03254v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality. To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO, that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2% and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors. To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on speaker-specific audio features.

Existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals, promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face similarity.</p></details> |  |

However, existing detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video, VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo, D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust performance.

Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating extended videos remains a formidable challenge.

This limitation stems from the complexity of long video generation, which requires more than generative AI techniques for approximating density functions essential aspects such as planning, story development, and maintaining spatial and temporal consistency present additional hurdles. Integrating generative AI with a divide-and-conquer approach could improve scalability for longer videos while offering greater control. In this survey, we examine the current landscape of long video generation, covering foundational techniques like GANs and diffusion models, video generation strategies, large-scale training datasets, quality metrics for evaluating long videos, and future research areas to address the limitations of the existing video generation capabilities.

However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images. These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content and temporal stability in real-world scenarios.

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

However, conditioning generation on specific poses introduces serious risks, such as impersonation, privacy violations, and NSFW content creation. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{PoseGuard}$, a safety alignment framework for pose-guided generation. PoseGuard is designed to suppress unsafe generations by degrading output quality when encountering malicious poses, while maintaining high-fidelity outputs for benign inputs. We categorize unsafe poses into three representative types: discriminatory gestures such as kneeling or offensive salutes, sexually suggestive poses that lead to NSFW content, and poses imitating copyrighted celebrity movements. PoseGuard employs a dual-objective training strategy combining generation fidelity with safety alignment, and uses LoRA-based fine-tuning for efficient, parameter-light updates. To ensure adaptability to evolving threats, PoseGuard supports pose-specific LoRA fusion, enabling flexible and modular updates when new unsafe poses are identified. We further demonstrate the generalizability of PoseGuard to facial landmark-guided generation. Extensive experiments validate that PoseGuard effectively blocks unsafe generations, maintains generation quality for benign inputs, and remains robust against slight pose variations.</p></details> |  |

In online surveys, anthropomorphic agents could help address issues like careless responding and satisficing, which originate from the lack of personal engagement and perceived accountability. However, there is a lack of understanding of how ECAs in user experience research may affect participant engagement, satisfaction, and the quality of responses. As a proof of concept, we propose an instrument that enables the incorporation of conversations with a virtual avatar into surveys, using on AI-driven video generation, speech recognition, and Large Language Models. In our between-subjects study, 80 participants (UK, stratified random sample of general population) either talked to a voice-based agent with an animated video avatar, or interacted with a chatbot. Across surveys based on two self-reported psychometric tests, 2,265 conversation responses were obtained. Statistical comparison of results indicates that embodied agents can contribute significantly to more informative, detailed responses, as well as higher yet more time-efficient engagement. Furthermore, qualitative analysis provides valuable insights for causes of no significant change to satisfaction, linked to personal preferences, turn-taking delays and Uncanny Valley reactions. These findings support the pursuit and development of new methods toward human-like agents for the transformation of online surveys into more natural interactions resembling in-person interviews.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences.

Despite recent advancements, existing methods struggle with accurately identifying the rhythmic or semantic triggers from audio for generating contextualized gesture patterns and achieving pixel-level realism. To address these challenges, we introduce Contextual Gesture, a framework that improves co-speech gesture video generation through three innovative components: (1) a chronological speech-gesture alignment that temporally connects two modalities, (2) a contextualized gesture tokenization that incorporate speech context into motion pattern representation through distillation, and (3) a structure-aware refinement module that employs edge connection to link gesture keypoints to improve video generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Contextual Gesture not only produces realistic and speech-aligned gesture videos but also supports long-sequence generation and video gesture editing applications, shown in Fig.1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACMMM 2025.

| **[Versatile Transition Generation with Image-to-Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01698v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progressive Growing of Video Tokenizers for Temporally Compact Latent Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05442v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video tokenizers are essential for latent video diffusion models, converting raw video data into spatiotemporally compressed latent spaces for efficient training. However, extending state-of-the-art video tokenizers to achieve a temporal compression ratio beyond 4x without increasing channel capacity poses significant challenges. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to enhance temporal compression. We find that the reconstruction quality of temporally subsampled videos from a low-compression encoder surpasses that of high-compression encoders applied to original videos. This indicates that high-compression models can leverage representations from lower-compression models. Building on this insight, we develop a bootstrapped high-temporal-compression model that progressively trains high-compression blocks atop well-trained lower-compression models. Our method includes a cross-level feature-mixing module to retain information from the pretrained low-compression model and guide higher-compression blocks to capture the remaining details from the full video sequence. Evaluation of video benchmarks shows that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality while increasing temporal compression compared to directly training the full model. Furthermore, the resulting compact latent space effectively trains a video diffusion model for high-quality video generation with a significantly reduced token budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://progressive-video-tokenizer.github.io/Pro-MAG/</p></details> |
| **[Action2Dialogue: Generating Character-Centric Narratives from Scene-Level Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16819v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in scene-based video generation have enabled systems to synthesize coherent visual narratives from structured prompts. However, a crucial dimension of storytelling -- character-driven dialogue and speech -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that transforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative dialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character expression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the first defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior. While a story generation model such as Text2Story produces the corresponding visual scene, we focus on generating expressive, character-consistent utterances grounded in both the prompts and the scene image. A pretrained vision-language encoder extracts high-level semantic features from a representative frame, capturing salient visual context. These features are then integrated with structured prompts to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural dialogue. To ensure contextual and emotional consistency across scenes, we introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank -- a speaker-aware, temporally structured memory that recursively accumulates each character's dialogue history. Inspired by Script Theory in cognitive psychology, this design enables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals, social context, and narrative roles throughout the story. Finally, we render each utterance as expressive, character-conditioned speech, resulting in fully-voiced, multimodal video narratives. Our training-free framework generalizes across diverse story settings -- from fantasy adventures to slice-of-life episodes -- offering a scalable solution for coherent, character-grounded audiovisual storytelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures; revised manuscript</p></details> |
| **[Text2Story: Advancing Video Storytelling with Text Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06310v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating coherent long-form video sequences from discrete input using only text prompts is a critical task in content creation. While diffusion-based models excel at short video synthesis, long-form storytelling from text remains largely unexplored and a challenge due to challenges pertaining to temporal coherency, preserving semantic meaning and action continuity across the video. We introduce a novel AI-empowered storytelling framework to enable seamless video generation with natural action transitions and structured narratives. We first present a bidirectional time-weighted latent blending strategy to ensure temporal consistency between segments of the long-form video being generated. We then introduce a dynamics-informed prompt weighting (DIPW) mechanism that adaptively adjusts the influence of scene and action prompts at each diffusion timestep by jointly considering CLIP-based alignment, narrative continuity, and temporal smoothness. To further enhance motion continuity, we propose a semantic action representation to encode high-level action semantics into the blending process, dynamically adjusting transitions based on action similarity, ensuring smooth yet adaptable motion changes. Latent space blending maintains spatial coherence between objects in a scene, while time-weighted blending enforces bidirectional constraints for temporal consistency. The resulting integrative system prevents abrupt transitions while ensuring fluid storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, achieving temporally consistent and visually compelling video narratives without any additional training. This approach bridges the gap between short clips and extended video to establish a new paradigm in GenAI-driven video synthesis from text.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures; revised methodology</p></details> |
| **[$I^{2}$-World: Intra-Inter Tokenization for Efficient Dynamic 4D Scene Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09144v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose $I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that $I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

In this paper, we use video generation as a proxy for robot policy learning to address both limitations simultaneously. We propose Video Policy, a modular framework that combines video and action generation that can be trained end-to-end. Our results demonstrate that learning to generate videos of robot behavior allows for the extraction of policies with minimal demonstration data, significantly improving robustness and sample efficiency. Our method shows strong generalization to unseen objects, backgrounds, and tasks, both in simulation and the real world. We further highlight that task success is closely tied to the generated video, with action-free video data providing critical benefits for generalizing to novel tasks. By leveraging large-scale video generative models, we achieve superior performance compared to traditional behavior cloning, paving the way for more scalable and data-efficient robot policy learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts (VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment to the input audios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 33rd ACM Multimedia Conference (MM '25)</p></details> |

While progress has been made in binary forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly. To better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class forgery classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[Video Forgery Detection with Optical Flow Residuals and Spatial-Temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00397v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong generalization ability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

However, the rarity, unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos. These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Sumutan/GV-VAD.git.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we present a novel framework for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism, spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Workshop (HiGen)</p></details> |

WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video. These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics, formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools (trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.</p></details> | 27 pages, 1 figure |

In this paper, we present GameFactory, a framework for action-controlled scene-generalizable game video generation. We first address the fundamental challenge of action controllability by introducing GF-Minecraft, an action-annotated game video dataset without human bias, and developing an action control module that enables precise control over both keyboard and mouse inputs. We further extend to support autoregressive generation for unlimited-length interactive videos. More importantly, GameFactory tackles the critical challenge of scene-generalizable action control, which most existing methods fail to address. To enable the creation of entirely new and diverse games beyond fixed styles and scenes, we leverage the open-domain generative priors from pre-trained video diffusion models. To bridge the domain gap between open-domain priors and small-scale game datasets, we propose a multi-phase training strategy with a domain adapter that decouples game style learning from action control. This decoupling ensures that action control learning is no longer bound to specific game styles, thereby achieving scene-generalizable action control. Experimental results demonstrate that GameFactory effectively generates open-domain action-controllable game videos, representing a significant step forward in AI-driven game generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Highlight, Project Page: https://yujiwen.github.io/gamefactory</p></details> |

In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and substantial performance improvements.

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection.

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video distillation method. GVD jointly distills spatial and temporal features, ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC). Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF. Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30 percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video datasets demonstrate that GVD not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without significantly increasing computational cost.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments.

However, for robot manipulation, it is challenging to accurately model the fine-grained robot-object interaction within the visual space using existing methods which overlooks precise alignment between each action and the corresponding frame. In this paper, we present IRASim, a novel world model capable of generating videos with fine-grained robot-object interaction details, conditioned on historical observations and robot action trajectories. We train a diffusion transformer and introduce a novel frame-level action-conditioning module within each transformer block to explicitly model and strengthen the action-frame alignment. Extensive experiments show that: (1) the quality of the videos generated by our method surpasses all the baseline methods and scales effectively with increased model size and computation; (2) policy evaluations using IRASim exhibit a strong correlation with those using the ground-truth simulator, highlighting its potential to accelerate real-world policy evaluation; (3) testing-time scaling through model-based planning with IRASim significantly enhances policy performance, as evidenced by an improvement in the IoU metric on the Push-T benchmark from 0.637 to 0.961; (4) IRASim provides flexible action controllability, allowing virtual robotic arms in datasets to be controlled via a keyboard or VR controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>Opens...</summary><p>Opensource, project website: https://gen-irasim.github.io</p></details> |

Unlike existing approaches that rely on priors from multi-view image and video generation models, our method is based on native 3D mesh generation models. Naively applying 3D mesh generation models to generate a mesh for each frame in a 4D task can lead to issues such as incorrect mesh poses, misalignment of mesh appearance, and inconsistencies in mesh geometry and texture maps. To address these problems, we propose a structured workflow that includes camera search and mesh reposing, condition embedding optimization for mesh appearance refinement, pairwise mesh registration for topology consistency, and global texture map optimization for texture consistency. Our method outputs high-quality 4D animated assets that are compatible with mainstream graphics and game software. Experimental results across a variety of animation types and motion amplitudes demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method.

Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1), comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

To bridge this gap and facilitate research in optical flow estimation and downstream tasks such as anime video generation and line drawing colorization, we introduce LinkTo-Anime, the first high-quality dataset specifically designed for cel anime character motion generated with 3D model rendering. LinkTo-Anime provides rich annotations including forward and backward optical flow, occlusion masks, and Mixamo Skeleton. The dataset comprises 395 video sequences, totally 24,230 training frames, 720 validation frames, and 4,320 test frames. Furthermore, a comprehensive benchmark is constructed with various optical flow estimation methods to analyze the shortcomings and limitations across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Ghost: Investigating Ranking Bias Hidden in AI-Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07327v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), the creation of high-quality AI-generated videos has become faster and easier, resulting in the Internet being flooded with all kinds of video content. However, the impact of these videos on the content ecosystem remains largely unexplored. Video information retrieval remains a fundamental approach for accessing video content. Building on the observation that retrieval models often favor AI-generated content in ad-hoc and image retrieval tasks, we investigate whether similar biases emerge in the context of challenging video retrieval, where temporal and visual factors may further influence model behavior. To explore this, we first construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing both real and AI-generated videos, along with a set of fair and rigorous metrics to assess bias. This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by two state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously design a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference, accounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and suboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video retrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our findings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval. Further investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the training set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference observed in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from both unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video bias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we fine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach. The results of this study highlight the potential implications of AI-generated videos on retrieval systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Accepted at ACMMM2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables geometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core capabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video prediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved feature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across reconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video generation models, our framework demonstrates zero-shot synthetic-to-real generalization despite never observing real-world data during training. Furthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action following and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling. Notably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance is comparable with or even better than that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether employs camera trajectories as geometry-informed action spaces, enabling effective action-conditioned prediction and visual planning. We hope our work inspires the community to explore new frontiers in physically-reasonable world modeling and its applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aether-world.github.io/</p></details> |

While existing object-centric approaches either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion, deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+21...</summary><p>12+21 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), currently under review</p></details> |

Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation, 12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation, validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and controllable generation.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |
| **[Model Reveals What to Cache: Profiling-Based Feature Reuse for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03140v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of creative applications.

Specifically, we consider a design principle of ``animation for editing'', and train Qffusion as a general animation framework from two still reference images while we can use it for portrait video editing easily by applying modified start and end frames as references during inference. Leveraging the powerful generative power of Stable Diffusion, we propose a Quadrant-grid Arrangement (QGA) scheme for latent re-arrangement, which arranges the latent codes of two reference images and that of four facial conditions into a four-grid fashion, separately. Then, we fuse features of these two modalities and use self-attention for both appearance and temporal learning, where representations at different times are jointly modeled under QGA. Our Qffusion can achieve stable video editing without additional networks or complex training stages, where only the input format of Stable Diffusion is modified. Further, we propose a Quadrant-grid Propagation (QGP) inference strategy, which enjoys a unique advantage on stable arbitrary-length video generation by processing reference and condition frames recursively. Through extensive experiments, Qffusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on portrait video editing. Project page: https://qffusion.github.io/page/.</p></details> | 19 pages |

We propose MaterialPicker, a multi-modal material generator leveraging a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, improving and simplifying the creation of high-quality materials from text prompts and/or photographs. Our method can generate a material based on an image crop of a material sample, even if the captured surface is distorted, viewed at an angle or partially occluded, as is often the case in photographs of natural scenes. We further allow the user to specify a text prompt to provide additional guidance for the generation. We finetune a pre-trained DiT-based video generator into a material generator, where each material map is treated as a frame in a video sequence. We evaluate our approach both quantitatively and qualitatively and show that it enables more diverse material generation and better distortion correction than previous work.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

However, the adversarial vulnerabilities of these models remain rarely explored. We observe that in T2V generation tasks, the generated videos often contain substantial redundant information not explicitly specified in the text prompts, such as environmental elements, secondary objects, and additional details, providing opportunities for malicious attackers to embed hidden harmful content. Exploiting this inherent redundancy, we introduce BadVideo, the first backdoor attack framework tailored for T2V generation. Our attack focuses on designing target adversarial outputs through two key strategies: (1) Spatio-Temporal Composition, which combines different spatiotemporal features to encode malicious information; (2) Dynamic Element Transformation, which introduces transformations in redundant elements over time to convey malicious information. Based on these strategies, the attacker's malicious target seamlessly integrates with the user's textual instructions, providing high stealthiness. Moreover, by exploiting the temporal dimension of videos, our attack successfully evades traditional content moderation systems that primarily analyze spatial information within individual frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BadVideo achieves high attack success rates while preserving original semantics and maintaining excellent performance on clean inputs. Overall, our work reveals the adversarial vulnerability of T2V models, calling attention to potential risks and misuse.

Existing methods lack flexible controllability and often rely on dense view data collection in controlled environments, limiting their generalizability across common datasets (e.g., nuScenes). In this paper, we introduce MagicDrive3D, a novel framework for controllable 3D street scene generation that combines video-based view synthesis with 3D representation (3DGS) generation. It supports multi-condition control, including road maps, 3D objects, and text descriptions. Unlike previous approaches that require 3D representation before training, MagicDrive3D first trains a multi-view video generation model to synthesize diverse street views. This method utilizes routinely collected autonomous driving data, reducing data acquisition challenges and enriching 3D scene generation. In the 3DGS generation step, we introduce Fault-Tolerant Gaussian Splatting to address minor errors and use monocular depth for better initialization, alongside appearance modeling to manage exposure discrepancies across viewpoints. Experiments show that MagicDrive3D generates diverse, high-quality 3D driving scenes, supports any-view rendering, and enhances downstream tasks like BEV segmentation, demonstrating its potential for autonomous driving simulation and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://flymin.github.io/magicdrive3d</p></details> |

To address these issues, we propose MagicDrive-V2, a novel approach that integrates the MVDiT block and spatial-temporal conditional encoding to enable multi-view video generation and precise geometric control. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method for obtaining contextual descriptions for videos to support diverse textual control, along with a progressive training strategy using mixed video data to enhance training efficiency and generalizability. Consequently, MagicDrive-V2 enables multi-view driving video synthesis with $3.3\times$ resolution and $4\times$ frame count (compared to current SOTA), rich contextual control, and geometric controls.

| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |

Toonify, a StyleGAN-based method, has become widely used for facial image stylization. To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB. In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we adopt an improved StyleGAN to generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which overcomes the limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable stylized video, which enables Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video frames, facilitating the synthesis of high-quality animations in the next stage. In Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), our method learns a stylized neutral head model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated stylized video. By combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the effectiveness of ToonifyGB on benchmark datasets using two representative styles: Arcane and Pixar.</p></details> |  |

In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60 subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available, ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for commonsense reasoning and factual generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[History-Guided Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06764v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a key technique for improving conditional generation in diffusion models, enabling more accurate control while enhancing sample quality. It is natural to extend this technique to video diffusion, which generates video conditioned on a variable number of context frames, collectively referred to as history. However, we find two key challenges to guiding with variable-length history: architectures that only support fixed-size conditioning, and the empirical observation that CFG-style history dropout performs poorly. To address this, we propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), a video diffusion architecture and theoretically grounded training objective that jointly enable conditioning on a flexible number of history frames. We then introduce History Guidance, a family of guidance methods uniquely enabled by DFoT. We show that its simplest form, vanilla history guidance, already significantly improves video generation quality and temporal consistency. A more advanced method, history guidance across time and frequency further enhances motion dynamics, enables compositional generalization to out-of-distribution history, and can stably roll out extremely long videos.

However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting transitions. To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV) dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV} dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Celeb-DF++: A Large-scale Challenging Video DeepFake Benchmark for Generalizable Forensics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18015v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity. However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment (FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/OUC-VAS/Celeb-DF-PP</p></details> |

While the personalization of dynamic concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning, limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs, enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and editing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page and Video : https://snap-research.github.io/zero-shot-dynamic-concepts/</p></details> |

In this report, we present a preview version of \method, which creates a dynamic world from an input image and allows exploration of the world using keyboard actions. To achieve this high-fidelity and interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework, which consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization, video generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First, we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion Transformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM) and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE) are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the high-quality world exploration dataset \sekai to train \method, and it achieves remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications.

Robot learning, however, has thus far failed to replicate this success and remains constrained by a scarcity of available data. Learning from videos (LfV) methods aim to address this data bottleneck by augmenting traditional robot data with large-scale internet video. This video data provides foundational information regarding physical dynamics, behaviours, and tasks, and can be highly informative for general-purpose robots. This survey systematically examines the emerging field of LfV. We first outline essential concepts, including detailing fundamental LfV challenges such as distribution shift and missing action labels in video data. Next, we comprehensively review current methods for extracting knowledge from large-scale internet video, overcoming LfV challenges, and improving robot learning through video-informed training. The survey concludes with a critical discussion of future opportunities. Here, we emphasize the need for scalable foundation model approaches that can leverage the full range of available internet video and enhance the learning of robot policies and dynamics models. Overall, the survey aims to inform and catalyse future LfV research, driving progress towards general-purpose robots.</p></details> |  |

However, prior efforts in this field have either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation.

However, AI-generated videos (AGVs) involving human activities often exhibit substantial visual and semantic distortions, hindering the practical application of video generation technologies in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we conduct a pioneering study on human activity AGV quality assessment, focusing on visual quality evaluation and the identification of semantic distortions. First, we construct the AI-Generated Human activity Video Quality Assessment (Human-AGVQA) dataset, consisting of 6,000 AGVs derived from 15 popular text-to-video (T2V) models using 400 text prompts that describe diverse human activities. We conduct a subjective study to evaluate the human appearance quality, action continuity quality, and overall video quality of AGVs, and identify semantic issues of human body parts. Based on Human-AGVQA, we benchmark the performance of T2V models and analyze their strengths and weaknesses in generating different categories of human activities. Second, we develop an objective evaluation metric, named AI-Generated Human activity Video Quality metric (GHVQ), to automatically analyze the quality of human activity AGVs. GHVQ systematically extracts human-focused quality features, AI-generated content-aware quality features, and temporal continuity features, making it a comprehensive and explainable quality metric for human activity AGVs. The extensive experimental results show that GHVQ outperforms existing quality metrics on the Human-AGVQA dataset by a large margin, demonstrating its efficacy in assessing the quality of human activity AGVs. The Human-AGVQA dataset and GHVQ metric will be released at https://github.com/zczhang-sjtu/GHVQ.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot, a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments.

| **[Controllable Video Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16869v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular, the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex, multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models, analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

We address these gaps with BeyondMimic, the first real-world framework to learn from human motions for versatile and naturalistic humanoid control via guided diffusion. Our framework provides a motion tracking pipeline capable of challenging skills such as jumping spins, sprinting, and cartwheels with state-of-the-art motion quality. Moving beyond mimicking existing motions and synthesize novel ones, we further introduce a unified diffusion policy that enables zero-shot task-specific control at test time using simple cost functions. Deployed on hardware, BeyondMimic performs diverse tasks at test time, including waypoint navigation, joystick teleoperation, and obstacle avoidance, bridging sim-to-real motion tracking and flexible synthesis of human motion primitives for whole-body control. https://beyondmimic.github.io/.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

While super-resolution is an efficient post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details. Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific simulations.

However, most simulation environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation, these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA), which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in). Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.</p></details> |  |

We achieve this by deeply integrating a pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm. Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple, diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model. This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently, TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |

To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

However, their deployment in real-time and mobile environments remains challenging due to the iterative and resource-intensive nature of the inference process. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a unified optimization framework that jointly tackles service placement and multiple access control for GDMs in mobile edge networks. We propose LEARN-GDM, a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based algorithm that dynamically partitions denoising blocks across heterogeneous edge nodes, while accounting for latent transmission costs and enabling adaptive reduction of inference steps. Our approach integrates a greedy multiple access scheme with a Double and Dueling Deep Q-Learning (D3QL)-based service placement, allowing for scalable, adaptable, and resource-efficient operation under stringent quality of service requirements. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of scalability and latency resilience compared to conventional monolithic and fixed chain-length placement strategies. This work advances the state of the art in edge-enabled GenAI by offering an adaptable solution for GDM services orchestration, paving the way for future extensions toward semantic networking and co-inference across distributed environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for presentation at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025.

| **[Score Augmentation for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07926v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling. However, this study confirms the existence of overfitting in diffusion model training, particularly in data-limited regimes. To address this challenge, we propose Score Augmentation (ScoreAug), a novel data augmentation framework specifically designed for diffusion models. Unlike conventional augmentation approaches that operate on clean data, ScoreAug applies transformations to noisy data, aligning with the inherent denoising mechanism of diffusion. Crucially, ScoreAug further requires the denoiser to predict the augmentation of the original target. This design establishes an equivariant learning objective, enabling the denoiser to learn scores across varied denoising spaces, thereby realizing what we term score augmentation. We also theoretically analyze the relationship between scores in different spaces under general transformations. In experiments, we extensively validate ScoreAug on multiple benchmarks including CIFAR-10, FFHQ, AFHQv2, and ImageNet, with results demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines. Notably, ScoreAug effectively mitigates overfitting across diverse scenarios, such as varying data scales and model capacities, while exhibiting stable convergence properties. Another advantage of ScoreAug over standard data augmentation lies in its ability to circumvent data leakage issues under certain conditions. Furthermore, we show that ScoreAug can be synergistically combined with traditional data augmentation techniques to achieve additional performance gains.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these barriers, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI CAPI 2025</p></details> |

Existing studies for learning such ability primarily focus on static human-object interaction (HOI) patterns, such as contact and spatial relationships, while dynamic HOI patterns, capturing the movement of humans and objects over time, remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel framework for learning Dynamic Affordance across various target object categories. To address the scarcity of 4D HOI datasets, our method learns the 3D dynamic affordance from synthetically generated 4D HOI samples. Specifically, we propose a pipeline that first generates 2D HOI videos from a given 3D target object using a pre-trained video diffusion model, then lifts them into 3D to generate 4D HOI samples. Leveraging these synthesized 4D HOI samples, we train DAViD, our generative 4D human-object interaction model, which is composed of two key components: (1) a human motion diffusion model (MDM) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to fine-tune a pre-trained MDM to learn the HOI motion concepts from limited HOI motion samples, (2) a motion diffusion model for 4D object poses conditioned by produced human interaction motions. Interestingly, DAViD can integrate newly learned HOI motion concepts with pre-trained human motions to create novel HOI motions, even for multiple HOI motion concepts, demonstrating the advantage of our pipeline with LoRA in integrating dynamic HOI concepts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DAViD outperforms baselines in synthesizing HOI motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://snuvclab.github.io/david/</p></details> |

We hypothesize that images synthesized by 2D diffusion models inherently capture realistic OOR cues, enabling efficient collection of a 3D dataset to learn OOR for various unbounded object categories. Our approach synthesizes diverse images that capture plausible OOR cues, which we then uplift into 3D samples. Leveraging our diverse collection of 3D samples for the object pairs, we train a score-based OOR diffusion model to learn the distribution of their relative spatial relationships. Additionally, we extend our pairwise OOR to multi-object OOR by enforcing consistency across pairwise relations and preventing object collisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our method across various object-object spatial relationships, along with its applicability to 3D scene arrangement tasks and human motion synthesis using our OOR diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tlb-miss.github.io/oor/</p></details> |

Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands, preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks, demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |
| **[EDiT: Efficient Diffusion Transformers with Linear Compressed Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16726v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as a leading architecture for text-to-image synthesis, producing high-quality and photorealistic images. However, the quadratic scaling properties of the attention in DiTs hinder image generation with higher resolution or on devices with limited resources. This work introduces an efficient diffusion transformer (EDiT) to alleviate these efficiency bottlenecks in conventional DiTs and Multimodal DiTs (MM-DiTs). First, we present a novel linear compressed attention method that uses a multi-layer convolutional network to modulate queries with local information while keys and values are aggregated spatially. Second, we formulate a hybrid attention scheme for multimodal inputs that combines linear attention for image-to-image interactions and standard scaled dot-product attention for interactions involving prompts. Merging these two approaches leads to an expressive, linear-time Multimodal Efficient Diffusion Transformer (MM-EDiT). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EDiT and MM-EDiT architectures by integrating them into PixArt-Sigma (conventional DiT) and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Medium (MM-DiT), achieving up to 2.2x speedup with comparable image quality after distillation.</p></details> |  |

Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative paradigms for surgical phase recognition.</p></details> |  |

Users increasingly seek to apply various editing methods to polish generated 3D content, aiming to enhance its color, style, and lighting without compromising the underlying geometry. However, most existing editing tools focus on the 2D domain, and directly feeding their results into 3D generation methods (like multi-view diffusion models) will introduce information loss, degrading the quality of the final 3D assets. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free, plug-and-play scheme that aligns edited assets with their original geometry in a single inference run. Central to our approach is a geometry preservation module that guides the edited multi-view generation with original input normal latents. Besides, an injection switcher is proposed to deliberately control the supervision extent of the original normals, ensuring the alignment between the edited color and normal views. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves both the multi-view consistency and mesh quality of edited 3D assets, across multiple combinations of multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional multi-step diffusion-based methods, DiffVC-OSD feeds the reconstructed latent representation directly into a One-Step Diffusion Model, enhancing perceptual quality through a single diffusion step guided by both temporal context and the latent itself. To better leverage temporal dependencies, we design a Temporal Context Adapter that encodes conditional inputs into multi-level features, offering more fine-grained guidance for the Denoising Unet. Additionally, we employ an End-to-End Finetuning strategy to improve overall compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVC-OSD achieves state-of-the-art perceptual compression performance, offers about 20$\times$ faster decoding and a 86.92\% bitrate reduction compared to the corresponding multi-step diffusion-based variant.</p></details> |  |

The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity information inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion transformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically, unlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing DiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states by weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This alleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture distinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive module is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video decoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting their long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens, thereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency. Consequently, LaVieID can generate high-fidelity personalized videos and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/ssugarwh/LaVieID.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Recently, the Western-origin #wlw (women-loving-women) hashtag has risen in the Chinese lesbian community on RedNote, coinciding with user migration triggered by the temporary US TikTok ban. This event provides a unique lens to study cross-cultural hashtag ingress and diffusion through the populations' responsive behaviors in cyber-migration. In this paper, we conducted a two-phase content analysis of 418 #wlw posts from January and April, examining different usage patterns during the hashtag's ingress and diffusion. Results indicate that the successful introduction of #wlw was facilitated by TikTok immigrants' bold importation, both populations' mutual interpretation, and RedNote natives' discussions. In current manifestation of diffusion, #wlw becomes a RedNote-recognized queer hashtag for sharing queer life, and semantically expands to support feminism discourse. Our findings provide empirical insights for enhancing the marginalized communities' cross-cultural communication.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we introduce Splat4D, a novel framework enabling high-fidelity 4D content generation from a monocular video. Splat4D achieves superior performance while maintaining faithful spatial-temporal coherence by leveraging multi-view rendering, inconsistency identification, a video diffusion model, and an asymmetric U-Net for refinement. Through extensive evaluations on public benchmarks, Splat4D consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, underscoring the efficacy of our approach. Additionally, the versatility of Splat4D is validated in various applications such as text/image conditioned 4D generation, 4D human generation, and text-guided content editing, producing coherent outcomes following user instructions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Multimodal Diffusion Transformers for Enhanced Prompt-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07519v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based diffusion models have recently superseded traditional U-Net architectures, with multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) emerging as the dominant approach in state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 and Flux.1. Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks, revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models. We believe our findings bridge the gap between existing U-Net-based methods and emerging architectures, offering deeper insights into MMDiT's behavioral patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

More precisely, the diffusion is nonlinear and may vanish or become multivalued for certain values of the unknown, so the parabolic equation becomes hyperbolic or elliptic, respectively. After performing an Euler implicit time-stepping, a splitting strategy is applied to the time-discrete equations. This leads to a formulation that is more suitable for dealing with the degeneracies. Based on this splitting, different iterative linearization strategies are considered, namely the Newton scheme, the L-scheme, and the modified L-scheme. We prove the convergence of the latter two schemes even for the double-degenerate case. In the non-degenerate case, we prove that the scheme is contractive, and the contraction rate is proportional to a non-negative exponent of the time-step size. Moreover, an a posteriori estimator-based adaptive algorithm is developed to select the optimal parameters for the M-scheme, which accelerates its convergence. Numerical results are presented, showing that the M- and the M-adaptive schemes are more stable than the Newton scheme, as they converge irrespective of the mesh. Moreover, the adaptive M-scheme consistently out-competes not only the M/L-schemes, but also the Newton scheme showing quadratic convergence behavior.</p></details> | 39 pages, 20 figures |
| **[Reward-Directed Score-Based Diffusion Models via q-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04832v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new reinforcement learning (RL) formulation for training continuous-time score-based diffusion models for generative AI to generate samples that maximize reward functions while keeping the generated distributions close to the unknown target data distributions. Different from most existing studies, ours does not involve any pretrained model for the unknown score functions of the noise-perturbed data distributions, nor does it attempt to learn the score functions. Instead, we formulate the problem as entropy-regularized continuous-time RL and show that the optimal stochastic policy has a Gaussian distribution with a known covariance matrix. Based on this result, we parameterize the mean of Gaussian policies and develop an actor--critic type (little) q-learning algorithm to solve the RL problem. A key ingredient in our algorithm design is to obtain noisy observations from the unknown score function via a ratio estimator. Our formulation can also be adapted to solve pure score-matching and fine-tuning pretrained models. Numerically, we show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance with two state-of-the-art RL methods that fine-tune pretrained models on several generative tasks including high-dimensional image generations. Finally, we discuss extensions of our RL formulation to probability flow ODE implementation of diffusion models and to conditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SODiff: Semantic-Oriented Diffusion Model for JPEG Compression Artifacts Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07346v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>JPEG, as a widely used image compression standard, often introduces severe visual artifacts when achieving high compression ratios. Although existing deep learning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often struggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and efficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts removal. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing semantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully leveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features from low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space semantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it preserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the compression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the optimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process. Extensive experimental results show that our SODiff outperforms recent leading methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: Flat Sketch to Realistic Garment Image (FS2RG), which generates realistic garment images by integrating flat sketches and textual guidance. FS2RG presents two key challenges: 1) fabric characteristics are solely guided by textual prompts, providing insufficient visual supervision for diffusion-based models, which limits their ability to capture fine-grained fabric details; 2) flat sketches and textual guidance may provide conflicting information, requiring the model to selectively preserve or modify garment attributes while maintaining structural coherence. To tackle this task, we propose HiGarment, a novel framework that comprises two core components: i) a multi-modal semantic enhancement mechanism that enhances fabric representation across textual and visual modalities, and ii) a harmonized cross-attention mechanism that dynamically balances information from flat sketches and text prompts, allowing controllable synthesis by generating either sketch-aligned (image-biased) or text-guided (text-biased) outputs. Furthermore, we collect Multi-modal Detailed Garment, the largest open-source dataset for garment generation. Experimental results and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGarment in garment synthesis. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Maple498/HiGarment.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Meta-Unlearning on Diffusion Models: Preventing Relearning Unlearned Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12777v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid progress of diffusion-based content generation, significant efforts are being made to unlearn harmful or copyrighted concepts from pretrained diffusion models (DMs) to prevent potential model misuse. However, it is observed that even when DMs are properly unlearned before release, malicious finetuning can compromise this process, causing DMs to relearn the unlearned concepts. This occurs partly because certain benign concepts (e.g., "skin") retained in DMs are related to the unlearned ones (e.g., "nudity"), facilitating their relearning via finetuning. To address this, we propose meta-unlearning on DMs. Intuitively, a meta-unlearned DM should behave like an unlearned DM when used as is; moreover, if the meta-unlearned DM undergoes malicious finetuning on unlearned concepts, the related benign concepts retained within it will be triggered to self-destruct, hindering the relearning of unlearned concepts. Our meta-unlearning framework is compatible with most existing unlearning methods, requiring only the addition of an easy-to-implement meta objective. We validate our approach through empirical experiments on meta-unlearning concepts from Stable Diffusion models (SD-v1-4 and SDXL), supported by extensive ablation studies. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Meta-Unlearning.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Existing methods primarily focus on static image analysis and lack the dynamic generation of medical imagery from textual descriptions. This study intends to partially close this gap by introducing a novel approach based on fine-tuned generative models to generate dynamic, scalable, and precise images from textual descriptions. Particularly, our system integrates fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth models, as well as Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA), to generate high-fidelity medical images. The problem is around two sub-tasks namely: image synthesis (IS) and optimal prompt production (OPG). The former creates medical images via verbal prompts, whereas the latter provides prompts that produce high-quality images in specified categories. The study emphasizes the limitations of traditional medical image generation methods, such as hand sketching, constrained datasets, static procedures, and generic models. Our evaluation measures showed that Stable Diffusion surpasses CLIP and DreamBooth + LORA in terms of producing high-quality, diversified images. Specifically, Stable Diffusion had the lowest Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores (0.099 for single center, 0.064 for multi-center, and 0.067 for combined), indicating higher image quality. Furthermore, it had the highest average Inception Score (2.327 across all datasets), indicating exceptional diversity and quality. This advances the field of AI-powered medical diagnosis. Future research will concentrate on model refining, dataset augmentation, and ethical considerations for efficiently implementing these advances into clinical practice</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent and Controllable Image Animation with Motion Linear Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07246v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image animation has seen significant progress, driven by the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models. However, maintaining appearance consistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions in generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V) generation has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer models, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion models, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic complexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy computational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive. To address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation. Specifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational text-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient linear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation quality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling motion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal consistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to suppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to balance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods validate the superiority of MiraMo in generating consistent, smooth, and controllable animations with accelerated inference speed. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of MiraMo through applications in motion transfer and video editing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://maxin-cn.github.io/miramo_project</p></details> |

However, our empirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental confounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause heuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These misleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations induced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability under distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing negative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process, CNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus reduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal regularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental confounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives that promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Comprehensive experiments under four representative distribution shift scenarios demonstrate that CNSDiff achieves an average improvement of 13.96% across all evaluation metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines, verifying its effectiveness and robustness in OOD recommendation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, Under-review</p></details> |

We propose LayerTracer, a diffusion transformer based framework that bridges this gap by learning designers' layered SVG creation processes from a novel dataset of sequential design operations. Our approach operates in two phases: First, a text-conditioned DiT generates multi-phase rasterized construction blueprints that simulate human design workflows. Second, layer-wise vectorization with path deduplication produces clean, editable SVGs. For image vectorization, we introduce a conditional diffusion mechanism that encodes reference images into latent tokens, guiding hierarchical reconstruction while preserving structural integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate LayerTracer's superior performance against optimization-based and neural baselines in both generation quality and editability, effectively aligning AI-generated vectors with professional design cognition.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness, concerns have been raised that diffusion models - widely adopted in other machine-learning domains - could potentially lead to unfair outcomes, since they are trained to recover data distributions that often encode inherent biases. Motivated by the related literature, and acknowledging the extensive discussion around bias and fairness aspects in recommendation, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical study of fairness for DiffRec, chronologically the pioneer technique in diffusion-based recommendation. Our empirical study involves DiffRec and its variant L-DiffRec, tested against nine recommender systems on two benchmarking datasets to assess recommendation utility and fairness from both consumer and provider perspectives. Specifically, we first evaluate the utility and fairness dimensions separately and, then, within a multi-criteria setting to investigate whether, and to what extent, these approaches can achieve a trade-off between the two. While showing worrying trends in alignment with the more general machine-learning literature on diffusion models, our results also indicate promising directions to address the unfairness issue in future work.

Existing deep learning approaches often struggle to balance global structural consistency with local detail preservation, especially under complex meteorological conditions. We propose DuoCast, a dual-diffusion framework that decomposes precipitation forecasting into low- and high-frequency components modeled in orthogonal latent subspaces. We theoretically prove that this frequency decomposition reduces prediction error compared to conventional single branch U-Net diffusion models. In DuoCast, the low-frequency model captures large-scale trends via convolutional encoders conditioned on weather front dynamics, while the high-frequency model refines fine-scale variability using a self-attention-based architecture. Experiments on four benchmark radar datasets show that DuoCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in both spatial detail and temporal evolution.</p></details> |  |

We suggest that even large models can be treated as creative materials if their internal structure is exposed and manipulable. We propose a craft-based approach to explainability rooted in long-term, hands-on engagement akin to Sch\"on's "reflection-in-action" and demonstrate its application through a model-bending and inspection plugin integrated into the node-based interface of ComfyUI.

While generative adversarial networks and diffusion models can produce more natural-looking patches, they often fail to balance stealthiness with attack effectiveness and lack flexibility for user customization. To address these limitations, we propose BadPatch, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating customizable and naturalistic adversarial patches. Our approach allows users to start from a reference image (rather than random noise) and incorporates masks to create patches of various shapes, not limited to squares. To preserve the original semantics during the diffusion process, we employ Null-text inversion to map random noise samples to a single input image and generate patches through Incomplete Diffusion Optimization (IDO). Our method achieves attack performance comparable to state-of-the-art non-naturalistic patches while maintaining a natural appearance. Using BadPatch, we construct AdvT-shirt-1K, the first physical adversarial T-shirt dataset comprising over a thousand images captured in diverse scenarios. AdvT-shirt-1K can serve as a useful dataset for training or testing future defense methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/Wwangb/BadPatch</p></details> |

Generally, the articulated humans and rigid objects exhibit different motion patterns, due to their distinct intrinsic physical properties. However, this distinction is ignored by most of the existing works, which intend to capture the dynamics of both humans and objects within a single prediction model. In this work, we propose a novel contact-consistent decoupled diffusion framework CoopDiff, which employs two distinct branches to decouple human and object motion modeling, with the human-object contact points as shared anchors to bridge the motion generation across branches. The human dynamics branch is aimed to predict highly structured human motion, while the object dynamics branch focuses on the object motion with rigid translations and rotations. These two branches are bridged by a series of shared contact points with consistency constraint for coherent human-object motion prediction. To further enhance human-object consistency and prediction reliability, we propose a human-driven interaction module to guide object motion modeling. Extensive experiments on the BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets demonstrate that our CoopDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intention-Aware Diffusion Model for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07146v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions. Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However, questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities: Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets for AI diagnostic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Workshop on Human-AI Collaboration at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

However, existing dialogue planning methods generate dialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from compounding errors and myopic actions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages diffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning. DiffTOD formulates dialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance, and leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the dialogue trajectory. To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD introduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types, offering flexible guidance toward diverse TOD targets at test time. Extensive experiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively perform non-myopic lookahead exploration and optimize action strategies over a long horizon through non-sequential dialogue planning, and demonstrates strong flexibility across complex and diverse dialogue scenarios.

Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, but existing methods for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which introduces additional computational overhead and often fails to effectively balance the trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. To address these issues, we propose Video Signature (VIDSIG), an in-generation watermarking method for latent video diffusion models, which enables implicit and adaptive watermark integration during generation. Specifically, we achieve this by partially fine-tuning the latent decoder, where Perturbation-Aware Suppression (PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal consistency by introducing a lightweight Temporal Alignment module that guides the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning. Experimental results show that VIDSIG achieves the best overall performance in watermark extraction, visual quality, and generation efficiency. It also demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tampering, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

| **[Whisfusion: Parallel ASR Decoding via a Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07048v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is critical for latency-sensitive applications such as real-time captioning and meeting transcription. However, truly parallel ASR decoding remains challenging due to the sequential nature of autoregressive (AR) decoders and the context limitations of non-autoregressive (NAR) methods. While modern ASR encoders can process up to 30 seconds of audio at once, AR decoders still generate tokens sequentially, creating a latency bottleneck. We propose Whisfusion, the first framework to fuse a pre-trained Whisper encoder with a text diffusion decoder. This NAR architecture resolves the AR latency bottleneck by processing the entire acoustic context in parallel at every decoding step. A lightweight cross-attention adapter trained via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges the two modalities. We also introduce a batch-parallel, multi-step decoding strategy that improves accuracy by increasing the number of candidates with minimal impact on speed. Fine-tuned solely on LibriSpeech (960h), Whisfusion achieves a lower WER than Whisper-tiny (8.3% vs. 9.7%), and offers comparable latency on short audio. For longer utterances (>20s), it is up to 2.6x faster than the AR baseline, establishing a new, efficient operating point for long-form ASR. The implementation and training scripts are available at https://github.com/taeyoun811/Whisfusion.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in MS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025 (LMID Workshop)</p></details> |

However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task. The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention (MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[CDP: Towards Robust Autoregressive Visuomotor Policy Learning via Causal Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14769v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.</p></details> |  |

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The webpage is at https://dex-vla.github.io/.

Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal large language models (MLLM) fail to generate images based on the hidden meaning inherent in rhetorical language--despite such content being readily mappable to visual representations by humans. A key limitation is that current models emphasize object-level word embedding alignment, causing metaphorical expressions to steer image generation towards their literal visuals and overlook the intended semantic meaning. To address this, we propose Rhet2Pix, a framework that formulates rhetorical text-to-image generation as a multi-step policy optimization problem, incorporating a two-layer MDP diffusion module. In the outer layer, Rhet2Pix converts the input prompt into incrementally elaborated sub-sentences and executes corresponding image-generation actions, constructing semantically richer visuals. In the inner layer, Rhet2Pix mitigates reward sparsity during image generation by discounting the final reward and optimizing every adjacent action pair along the diffusion denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Rhet2Pix in rhetorical text-to-image generation. Our model outperforms SOTA MLLMs such as GPT-4o, Grok-3 and leading academic baselines across both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, currently there is no straightforward and efficient framework to transfer the multimodal comprehension abilities of MLLMs to T2I models to enable them to understand multimodal inputs. In this paper, we propose the X2I framework, which endows Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models with the capability to comprehend various modalities, including multilingual text, screenshot documents, images, videos, and audio. X2I is trained using merely 100K English corpus with 160 GPU hours. Building on the DiT teacher model, we adopt an innovative distillation method to extract the inference capabilities of the teacher model and design a lightweight AlignNet structure to serve as an intermediate bridge. Compared to the teacher model, X2I shows a decrease in performance degradation of less than 1\% while gaining various multimodal understanding abilities, including multilingual to image, image to image, image-text to image, video to image, audio to image, and utilizing creative fusion to enhance imagery. Furthermore, it is applicable for LoRA training in the context of image-text to image generation, filling a void in the industry in this area. We further design a simple LightControl to enhance the fidelity of instructional image editing. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, multifunctionality, and transferability of our X2I.

| **[Towards Effective Prompt Stealing Attack against Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06837v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) models, represented by DALL$\cdot$E and Midjourney, have gained huge popularity for creating realistic images. The quality of these images relies on the carefully engineered prompts, which have become valuable intellectual property. While skilled prompters showcase their AI-generated art on markets to attract buyers, this business incidentally exposes them to \textit{prompt stealing attacks}. Existing state-of-the-art attack techniques reconstruct the prompts from a fixed set of modifiers (i.e., style descriptions) with model-specific training, which exhibit restricted adaptability and effectiveness to diverse showcases (i.e., target images) and diffusion models. To alleviate these limitations, we propose Prometheus, a training-free, proxy-in-the-loop, search-based prompt-stealing attack, which reverse-engineers the valuable prompts of the showcases by interacting with a local proxy model. It consists of three innovative designs. First, we introduce dynamic modifiers, as a supplement to static modifiers used in prior works. These dynamic modifiers provide more details specific to the showcases, and we exploit NLP analysis to generate them on the fly. Second, we design a contextual matching algorithm to sort both dynamic and static modifiers. This offline process helps reduce the search space of the subsequent step. Third, we interact with a local proxy model to invert the prompts with a greedy search algorithm. Based on the feedback guidance, we refine the prompt to achieve higher fidelity. The evaluation results show that Prometheus successfully extracts prompts from popular platforms like PromptBase and AIFrog against diverse victim models, including Midjourney, Leonardo.ai, and DALL$\cdot$E, with an ASR improvement of 25.0\%. We also validate that Prometheus is resistant to extensive potential defenses, further highlighting its severity in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes an effective training-free, proxy-in-the-loop, and search-based prompt-stealing scheme against T2I models</p></details> |
| **[A Score-based Diffusion Model Approach for Adaptive Learning of Stochastic Partial Differential Equation Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06834v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for adaptively learning the time-evolving solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) using score-based diffusion models within a recursive Bayesian inference setting. SPDEs play a central role in modeling complex physical systems under uncertainty, but their numerical solutions often suffer from model errors and reduced accuracy due to incomplete physical knowledge and environmental variability. To address these challenges, we encode the governing physics into the score function of a diffusion model using simulation data and incorporate observational information via a likelihood-based correction in a reverse-time stochastic differential equation. This enables adaptive learning through iterative refinement of the solution as new data becomes available. To improve computational efficiency in high-dimensional settings, we introduce the ensemble score filter, a training-free approximation of the score function designed for real-time inference. Numerical experiments on benchmark SPDEs demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under sparse and noisy observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning with Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06806v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline-to-online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) aims to perform online fine-tuning on an offline pre-trained policy to minimize costly online interactions. Existing work used offline datasets to generate data that conform to the online data distribution for data augmentation. However, generated data still exhibits a gap with the online data, limiting overall performance. To address this, we propose a new data augmentation approach, Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation (CFDG). Without introducing additional classifier training overhead, CFDG leverages classifier-free guidance diffusion to significantly enhance the generation quality of offline and online data with different distributions. Additionally, it employs a reweighting method to enable more generated data to align with the online data, enhancing performance while maintaining the agent's stability. Experimental results show that CFDG outperforms replaying the two data types or using a standard diffusion model to generate new data. Our method is versatile and can be integrated with existing offline-to-online RL algorithms. By implementing CFDG to popular methods IQL, PEX and APL, we achieve a notable 15% average improvement in empirical performance on the D4RL benchmark such as MuJoCo and AntMaze.</p></details> | ICML2025 |

Existing acceleration methods apply a fixed number of denoising steps per action, implicitly treating all actions as equally important. However, our experiments reveal that robotic tasks often contain a mix of \emph{crucial} and \emph{routine} actions, which differ in their impact on task success. Motivated by this finding, we propose \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{D}enoising \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{(D3P)}, a diffusion-based policy that adaptively allocates denoising steps across actions at test time. D3P uses a lightweight, state-aware adaptor to allocate the optimal number of denoising steps for each action. We jointly optimize the adaptor and base diffusion policy via reinforcement learning to balance task performance and inference efficiency. On simulated tasks, D3P achieves an averaged 2.2$\times$ inference speed-up over baselines without degrading success. Furthermore, we demonstrate D3P's effectiveness on a physical robot, achieving a 1.9$\times$ acceleration over the baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[StarPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial-Temporal Autoregressive Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02056v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

| **[Topology Generation of UAV Covert Communication Networks: A Graph Diffusion Approach with Incentive Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06746v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing demand for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks in sensitive applications, such as urban monitoring, emergency response, and secure sensing, ensuring reliable connectivity and covert communication has become increasingly vital. However, dynamic mobility and exposure risks pose significant challenges. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a self-organizing UAV network framework combining Graph Diffusion-based Policy Optimization (GDPO) with a Stackelberg Game (SG)-based incentive mechanism. The GDPO method uses generative AI to dynamically generate sparse but well-connected topologies, enabling flexible adaptation to changing node distributions and Ground User (GU) demands. Meanwhile, the Stackelberg Game (SG)-based incentive mechanism guides self-interested UAVs to choose relay behaviors and neighbor links that support cooperation and enhance covert communication. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of model convergence, topology generation quality, and enhancement of covert communication performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CycleDiff: Cycle Diffusion Models for Unpaired Image-to-image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06625v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a diffusion-based cross-domain image translator in the absence of paired training data. Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more coverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the cross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within the diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not aligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal while the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result, recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models. To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global optimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with diffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation process with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning manner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation learning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of joint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes, enhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural consistency. We have conducted extensive experiments on RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB and diverse cross-modality translation tasks including RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics and RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth, showcasing better generative performances than the state of the arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Diffusion Models and Phases of Data Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06614v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by statistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in synthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process gradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often spatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion models ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions, which are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into constructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two distributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be mutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers. Then, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial phase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local denoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on conditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a real-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures of diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small local neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are only necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This result also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions, the broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the design of neural networks inspired by physics concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+22 ...</summary><p>8+22 pages, 4+3 figures</p></details> |

Nevertheless, generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project page & Code: https://yehonathanlitman.github.io/light_switch/</p></details> |

However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |

However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%. FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[ActivityDiff: A diffusion model with Positive and Negative Activity Guidance for De Novo Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06364v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise control over a molecule's biological activity-encompassing targeted activation/inhibition, cooperative multi-target modulation, and off-target toxicity mitigation-remains a critical challenge in de novo drug design. However, existing generative methods primarily focus on producing molecules with a single desired activity, lacking integrated mechanisms for the simultaneous management of multiple intended and unintended molecular interactions. Here, we propose ActivityDiff, a generative approach based on the classifier-guidance technique of diffusion models. It leverages separately trained drug-target classifiers for both positive and negative guidance, enabling the model to enhance desired activities while minimizing harmful off-target effects. Experimental results show that ActivityDiff effectively handles essential drug design tasks, including single-/dual-target generation, fragment-constrained dual-target design, selective generation to enhance target specificity, and reduction of off-target effects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion in balancing efficacy and safety in molecular design. Overall, our work introduces a novel paradigm for achieving integrated control over molecular activity, and provides ActivityDiff as a versatile and extensible framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Diffusion Models Bridge the Domain Gap in Cardiac MR Imaging?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06327v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios, where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM) trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where, domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.</p></details> | ICONIP 2025 |

One can introduce a non-constant diffusion matrix to precondition these dynamics, and recent works have optimized it in order to improve the rate of convergence to stationarity by overcoming entropic and energy barriers. However, the introduced methodologies to compute these optimal diffusions are generally not suited to high-dimensional settings, as they rely on costly optimization procedures. In this work, we propose to optimize over a class of diffusion matrices, based on one-dimensional collective variables (CVs), to help the dynamics explore the latent space defined by the CV. The form of the diffusion matrix is chosen in order to obtain an efficient effective diffusion in the latent space. We describe how this class of diffusion matrices can be constructed and learned during the simulation.

| **[MoDA: Multi-modal Diffusion Architecture for Talking Head Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03256v3)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a crucial problem in the realm of the virtual metaverse. Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this field with their strong generation capabilities. However, several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference and visual artifacts caused by the implicit latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which complicates the diffusion process; 2) a lack of authentic facial expressions and head movements due to inadequate multi-modal information fusion. In this paper, MoDA handles these challenges by: 1) defining a joint parameter space that bridges motion generation and neural rendering, and leveraging flow matching to simplify diffusion learning; 2) introducing a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, enhancing overall facial expressiveness. In addition, a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy is employed to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring effective feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MoDA improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.

| **[ADPro: a Test-time Adaptive Diffusion Policy for Robot Manipulation via Manifold and Initial Noise Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06266v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful class of visuomotor controllers for robot manipulation, offering stable training and expressive multi-modal action modeling. However, existing approaches typically treat action generation as an unconstrained denoising process, ignoring valuable a priori knowledge about geometry and control structure. In this work, we propose the Adaptive Diffusion Policy (ADP), a test-time adaptation method that introduces two key inductive biases into the diffusion. First, we embed a geometric manifold constraint that aligns denoising updates with task-relevant subspaces, leveraging the fact that the relative pose between the end-effector and target scene provides a natural gradient direction, and guiding denoising along the geodesic path of the manipulation manifold. Then, to reduce unnecessary exploration and accelerate convergence, we propose an analytically guided initialization: rather than sampling from an uninformative prior, we compute a rough registration between the gripper and target scenes to propose a structured initial noisy action. ADP is compatible with pre-trained diffusion policies and requires no retraining, enabling test-time adaptation that tailors the policy to specific tasks, thereby enhancing generalization across novel tasks and environments. Experiments on RLBench, CALVIN, and real-world dataset show that ADPro, an implementation of ADP, improves success rates, generalization, and sampling efficiency, achieving up to 25% faster execution and 9% points over strong diffusion baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fewer Denoising Steps or Cheaper Per-Step Inference: Towards Compute-Optimal Diffusion Model Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06160v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning, is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff, a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of denoising steps.

To address these challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a diffusion-based solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works.

| **[UGD-IML: A Unified Generative Diffusion-based Framework for Constrained and Unconstrained Image Manipulation Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06101v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity, limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore, the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and 4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing 3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from arbitrary viewpoints. https://exploregs.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 Figures, ICCV 2025</p></details> |

KnapFormer builds on the insight that strong synergy exists between sequence parallelism and the need to address the significant token imbalance across ranks. This imbalance arises from variable-length text inputs and varying visual token counts in mixed-resolution and image-video joint training. KnapFormer redistributes tokens by first gathering sequence length metadata across all ranks in a balancing group and solving a global knapsack problem. The solver aims to minimize the variances of total workload per-GPU, while accounting for the effect of sequence parallelism. By integrating DeepSpeed-Ulysees-based sequence parallelism in the load-balancing decision process and utilizing a simple semi-empirical workload model, KnapFormers achieves minimal communication overhead and less than 1% workload discrepancy in real-world training workloads with sequence length varying from a few hundred to tens of thousands. It eliminates straggler effects and achieves 2x to 3x speedup when training state-of-the-art diffusion models like FLUX on mixed-resolution and image-video joint data corpora.

Recent methods are primarily built on UNet-based diffusion models, which have improved scene text editing results, but still struggle with complex glyph structures, especially for non-Latin ones (\eg, Chinese, Korean, Japanese). To address these issues, we present \textbf{FLUX-Text}, a simple and advanced multilingual scene text editing DiT method. Specifically, our FLUX-Text enhances glyph understanding and generation through lightweight Visual and Text Embedding Modules, while preserving the original generative capability of FLUX. We further propose a Regional Text Perceptual Loss tailored for text regions, along with a matching two-stage training strategy to better balance text editing and overall image quality. Benefiting from the DiT-based architecture and lightweight feature injection modules, FLUX-Text can be trained with only $0.1$M training examples, a \textbf{97\%} reduction compared to $2.9$M required by popular methods. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets, including English and Chinese benchmarks, demonstrate that our method surpasses other methods in visual quality and text fidelity.

Existing methods that directly train LLMs or bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder. These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our design choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bifrost-1.github.io</p></details> |
| **[A 3DGS-Diffusion Self-Supervised Framework for Normal Estimation from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05950v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation. Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reverse Diffusion Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05926v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method for sampling from unnormalized target distributions based on a reverse denoising diffusion process. While recent diffusion-based samplers simulate the reverse diffusion using approximate score functions, they can suffer from accumulating errors due to time discretization and imperfect score estimation. In this work, we introduce a principled SMC framework that formalizes diffusion-based samplers as proposals while systematically correcting for their biases. The core idea is to construct informative intermediate target distributions that progressively steer the sampling trajectory toward the final target distribution. Although ideal intermediate targets are intractable, we develop exact approximations using quantities from the score estimation-based proposal, without requiring additional model training or inference overhead. The resulting sampler, termed RDSMC, enables consistent sampling and unbiased estimation of the target's normalization constant under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic targets and real-world Bayesian inference problems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike Virtual Try-On (VTON), which digitally dresses models, VTOFF extracts canonical garment images, demanding precise reconstruction of shape, texture, and complex patterns, enabling robust evaluation of generative model fidelity. We propose TryOffDiff, adapting Stable Diffusion with SigLIP-based visual conditioning to deliver high-fidelity reconstructions. Experiments on VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets show that TryOffDiff outperforms adapted pose transfer and VTON baselines. We observe that traditional metrics such as SSIM inadequately reflect reconstruction quality, prompting our use of DISTS for reliable assessment. Our findings highlight VTOFF's potential to improve e-commerce product imagery, advance generative model evaluation, and guide future research on high-fidelity reconstruction.

However, most diffusion models are computationally expensive and difficult to interpret with a lack of theoretical justification. Random feature models on the other hand have gained popularity due to their interpretability but their application to complex machine learning tasks remains limited. In this work, we present a diffusion model-inspired deep random feature model that is interpretable and gives comparable numerical results to a fully connected neural network having the same number of trainable parameters. Specifically, we extend existing results for random features and derive generalization bounds between the distribution of sampled data and the true distribution using properties of score matching.

This underscores the urgent need for effective machine unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15857v5)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines latent diffusion models (LDMs) with variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable fast, conditional generation of optimized topologies. Unlike prior approaches, our method conditions the generative process on physically meaningful fields, specifically von Mises stress, strain energy density, volume fraction, and loading information, embedded as dense input channels. To further guide the generation process, we introduce auxiliary loss functions that penalize floating material, load imbalance, and volume fraction deviation, thereby encouraging physically realistic and manufacturable designs. Numerical experiments on a large synthetic dataset demonstrate that our VAE-LDM framework outperforms existing diffusion-based methods in compliance accuracy, volume control, and structural connectivity, providing a robust and scalable alternative to conventional</p></details> |  |

These models provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by framing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying diffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a significant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in that they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical organization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level corruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To address this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that incorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the denoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we selectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST subtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects grammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen code patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating structural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that syntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based language models in code generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

These models overlook the diverse safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process, adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores.

However, these methods can be slow in high-dimensional and complex scenes and produce non-smooth solutions. Given previously solved path-planning problems, it is highly desirable to learn their distribution and use it as a prior for new similar problems. Several works propose utilizing this prior to bootstrap the motion planning problem, either by sampling initial solutions from it, or using its distribution in a maximum-a-posterior formulation for trajectory optimization. In this work, we introduce Motion Planning Diffusion (MPD), an algorithm that learns trajectory distribution priors with diffusion models. These generative models have shown increasing success in encoding multimodal data and have desirable properties for gradient-based motion planning, such as cost guidance. Given a motion planning problem, we construct a cost function and sample from the posterior distribution using the learned prior combined with the cost function gradients during the denoising process. Instead of learning the prior on all trajectory waypoints, we propose learning a lower-dimensional representation of a trajectory using linear motion primitives, particularly B-spline curves. This parametrization guarantees that the generated trajectory is smooth, can be interpolated at higher frequencies, and needs fewer parameters than a dense waypoint representation. We demonstrate the results of our method ranging from simple 2D to more complex tasks using a 7-dof robot arm manipulator. In addition to learning from simulated data, we also use human demonstrations on a real-world pick-and-place task.</p></details> |  |

As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
