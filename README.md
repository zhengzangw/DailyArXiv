| **[Interspatial Attention for Efficient 4D Human Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15800v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating photorealistic videos of digital humans in a controllable manner is crucial for a plethora of applications. Existing approaches either build on methods that employ template-based 3D representations or emerging video generation models but suffer from poor quality or limited consistency and identity preservation when generating individual or multiple digital humans. In this paper, we introduce a new interspatial attention (ISA) mechanism as a scalable building block for modern diffusion transformer (DiT)--based video generation models. ISA is a new type of cross attention that uses relative positional encodings tailored for the generation of human videos. Leveraging a custom-developed video variation autoencoder, we train a latent ISA-based diffusion model on a large corpus of video data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for 4D human video synthesis, demonstrating remarkable motion consistency and identity preservation while providing precise control of the camera and body poses. Our code and model are publicly released at https://dsaurus.github.io/isa4d/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dsaurus.github.io/isa4d/</p></details> |
| **[Ca2-VDM: Efficient Autoregressive Video Diffusion Model with Causal Generation and Cache Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16375v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advance of diffusion models, today's video generation has achieved impressive quality. To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world applications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the last frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are highly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional frames that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated when the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model with long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase significantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression step). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with Causal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces unidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional frames can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every subsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it shares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage cost. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Ca2-VDM achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative video generation results and significantly improves the generation speed.

| **[BusterX: MLLM-Powered AI-Generated Video Forgery Detection and Explanation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12620v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaM-SLidE: Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12128v3)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models are spearheading recent progress in deep learning, showcasing strong promise for trajectory sampling in dynamical systems as well. However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability. Code is available at https://github.com/ml-jku/LaM-SLidE .</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ml-jku.github.io/LaM-SLidE/</p></details> |
| **[AvatarShield: Visual Reinforcement Learning for Human-Centric Video Forgery Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15173v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technologies, particularly in video generation, has led to unprecedented creative capabilities but also increased threats to information integrity, identity security, and public trust. Existing detection methods, while effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos, which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos, enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric video forensics.</p></details> |  |
| **[CineTechBench: A Benchmark for Cinematographic Technique Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15145v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cinematography is a cornerstone of film production and appreciation, shaping mood, emotion, and narrative through visual elements such as camera movement, shot composition, and lighting. Despite recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and video generation models, the capacity of current models to grasp and reproduce cinematographic techniques remains largely uncharted, hindered by the scarcity of expert-annotated data. To bridge this gap, we present CineTechBench, a pioneering benchmark founded on precise, manual annotation by seasoned cinematography experts across key cinematography dimensions. Our benchmark covers seven essential aspects-shot scale, shot angle, composition, camera movement, lighting, color, and focal length-and includes over 600 annotated movie images and 120 movie clips with clear cinematographic techniques. For the understanding task, we design question answer pairs and annotated descriptions to assess MLLMs' ability to interpret and explain cinematographic techniques. For the generation task, we assess advanced video generation models on their capacity to reconstruct cinema-quality camera movements given conditions such as textual prompts or keyframes. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 15+ MLLMs and 5+ video generation models. Our results offer insights into the limitations of current models and future directions for cinematography understanding and generation in automatically film production and appreciation.

| **[AnyCharV: Bootstrap Controllable Character Video Generation with Fine-to-Coarse Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08189v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Character video generation is a significant real-world application focused on producing high-quality videos featuring specific characters. Recent advancements have introduced various control signals to animate static characters, successfully enhancing control over the generation process. However, these methods often lack flexibility, limiting their applicability and making it challenging for users to synthesize a source character into a desired target scene. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, AnyCharV, that flexibly generates character videos using arbitrary source characters and target scenes, guided by pose information. Our approach involves a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we develop a base model capable of integrating the source character with the target scene using pose guidance. The second stage further bootstraps controllable generation through a self-boosting mechanism, where we use the generated video in the first stage and replace the fine mask with the coarse one, enabling training outcomes with better preservation of character details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Video-GPT via Next Clip Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12489v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPT has shown its remarkable success in natural language processing. However, the language sequence is not sufficient to describe spatial-temporal details in the visual world. Alternatively, the video sequence is good at capturing such details. Motivated by this fact, we propose a concise Video-GPT in this paper by treating video as new language for visual world modeling. By analogy to next token prediction in GPT, we introduce a novel next clip diffusion paradigm for pretraining Video-GPT. Different from the previous works, this distinct paradigm allows Video-GPT to tackle both short-term generation and long-term prediction, by autoregressively denoising the noisy clip according to the clean clips in the history. Extensive experiments show our Video-GPT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video prediction, which is the key factor towards world modeling (Physics-IQ Benchmark: Video-GPT 34.97 vs. Kling 23.64 vs. Wan 20.89). Moreover, it can be well adapted on 6 mainstream video tasks in both video generation and understanding, showing its great generalization capacity in downstream.

| **[Programmatic Video Prediction Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14948v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of estimating the world model describing the dynamics of a real world process assumes immense importance for anticipating and preparing for future outcomes. For applications such as video surveillance, robotics applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames. Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grouping First, Attending Smartly: Training-Free Acceleration for Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14687v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based Transformers have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities, but their high computational costs hinder practical deployment, for example, generating an $8192\times 8192$ image can take over an hour on an A100 GPU. In this work, we propose GRAT (\textbf{GR}ouping first, \textbf{AT}tending smartly), a training-free attention acceleration strategy for fast image and video generation without compromising output quality. The key insight is to exploit the inherent sparsity in learned attention maps (which tend to be locally focused) in pretrained Diffusion Transformers and leverage better GPU parallelism. Specifically, GRAT first partitions contiguous tokens into non-overlapping groups, aligning both with GPU execution patterns and the local attention structures learned in pretrained generative Transformers. It then accelerates attention by having all query tokens within the same group share a common set of attendable key and value tokens. These key and value tokens are further restricted to structured regions, such as surrounding blocks or criss-cross regions, significantly reducing computational overhead (e.g., attaining a \textbf{35.8$\times$} speedup over full attention when generating $8192\times 8192$ images) while preserving essential attention patterns and long-range context. We validate GRAT on pretrained Flux and HunyuanVideo for image and video generation, respectively. In both cases, GRAT achieves substantially faster inference without any fine-tuning, while maintaining the performance of full attention. We hope GRAT will inspire future research on accelerating Diffusion Transformers for scalable visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at oliverrensu.github.io/project/GRAT</p></details> |
| **[LMP: Leveraging Motion Prior in Zero-Shot Video Generation with Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14167v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large-scale pre-trained diffusion transformer models have made significant progress in video generation. While current DiT models can produce high-definition, high-frame-rate, and highly diverse videos, there is a lack of fine-grained control over the video content. Controlling the motion of subjects in videos using only prompts is challenging, especially when it comes to describing complex movements. Further, existing methods fail to control the motion in image-to-video generation, as the subject in the reference image often differs from the subject in the reference video in terms of initial position, size, and shape. To address this, we propose the Leveraging Motion Prior (LMP) framework for zero-shot video generation. Our framework harnesses the powerful generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion transformers to enable motion in the generated videos to reference user-provided motion videos in both text-to-video and image-to-video generation. To this end, we first introduce a foreground-background disentangle module to distinguish between moving subjects and backgrounds in the reference video, preventing interference in the target video generation. A reweighted motion transfer module is designed to allow the target video to reference the motion from the reference video. To avoid interference from the subject in the reference video, we propose an appearance separation module to suppress the appearance of the reference subject in the target video. We annotate the DAVIS dataset with detailed prompts for our experiments and design evaluation metrics to validate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in generation quality, prompt-video consistency, and control capability.

| **[Hunyuan-Game: Industrial-grade Intelligent Game Creation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14135v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent game creation represents a transformative advancement in game development, utilizing generative artificial intelligence to dynamically generate and enhance game content. Despite notable progress in generative models, the comprehensive synthesis of high-quality game assets, including both images and videos, remains a challenging frontier. To create high-fidelity game content that simultaneously aligns with player preferences and significantly boosts designer efficiency, we present Hunyuan-Game, an innovative project designed to revolutionize intelligent game production. Hunyuan-Game encompasses two primary branches: image generation and video generation. The image generation component is built upon a vast dataset comprising billions of game images, leading to the development of a group of customized image generation models tailored for game scenarios: (1) General Text-to-Image Generation. (2) Game Visual Effects Generation, involving text-to-effect and reference image-based game visual effect generation. (3) Transparent Image Generation for characters, scenes, and game visual effects. (4) Game Character Generation based on sketches, black-and-white images, and white models. The video generation component is built upon a comprehensive dataset of millions of game and anime videos, leading to the development of five core algorithmic models, each targeting critical pain points in game development and having robust adaptation to diverse game video scenarios: (1) Image-to-Video Generation. (2) 360 A/T Pose Avatar Video Synthesis. (3) Dynamic Illustration Generation. (4) Generative Video Super-Resolution. (5) Interactive Game Video Generation. These image and video generation models not only exhibit high-level aesthetic expression but also deeply integrate domain-specific knowledge, establishing a systematic understanding of diverse game and anime art styles.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTVCrafter: 4D Motion Tokenization for Open-World Human Image Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10238v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human image animation has gained increasing attention and developed rapidly due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely largely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits generalization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation. To tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video Crafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences (i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT (4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens. Compared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust spatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image and character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we introduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention with 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as 4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D world. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new direction for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our MTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98, surpassing the second-best by 65%. Powered by robust motion tokens, MTVCrafter also generalizes well to diverse open-world characters (single/multiple, full/half-body) across various styles and scenarios. Our video demos and code are on: https://github.com/DINGYANB/MTVCrafter.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinePhys: Fine-grained Human Action Generation by Explicitly Incorporating Physical Laws for Effective Skeletal Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13437v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in video generation, synthesizing physically plausible human actions remains a persistent challenge, particularly in modeling fine-grained semantics and complex temporal dynamics. For instance, generating gymnastics routines such as "switch leap with 0.5 turn" poses substantial difficulties for current methods, often yielding unsatisfactory results. To bridge this gap, we propose FinePhys, a Fine-grained human action generation framework that incorporates Physics to obtain effective skeletal guidance. Specifically, FinePhys first estimates 2D poses in an online manner and then performs 2D-to-3D dimension lifting via in-context learning. To mitigate the instability and limited interpretability of purely data-driven 3D poses, we further introduce a physics-based motion re-estimation module governed by Euler-Lagrange equations, calculating joint accelerations via bidirectional temporal updating. The physically predicted 3D poses are then fused with data-driven ones, offering multi-scale 2D heatmap guidance for the diffusion process. Evaluated on three fine-grained action subsets from FineGym (FX-JUMP, FX-TURN, and FX-SALTO), FinePhys significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Comprehensive qualitative results further demonstrate FinePhys's ability to generate more natural and plausible fine-grained human actions.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[MAGI-1: Autoregressive Video Generation at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13211v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MAGI-1, a world model that generates videos by autoregressively predicting a sequence of video chunks, defined as fixed-length segments of consecutive frames. Trained to denoise per-chunk noise that increases monotonically over time, MAGI-1 enables causal temporal modeling and naturally supports streaming generation. It achieves strong performance on image-to-video (I2V) tasks conditioned on text instructions, providing high temporal consistency and scalability, which are made possible by several algorithmic innovations and a dedicated infrastructure stack. MAGI-1 facilitates controllable generation via chunk-wise prompting and supports real-time, memory-efficient deployment by maintaining constant peak inference cost, regardless of video length. The largest variant of MAGI-1 comprises 24 billion parameters and supports context lengths of up to 4 million tokens, demonstrating the scalability and robustness of our approach. The code and models are available at https://github.com/SandAI-org/MAGI-1 and https://github.com/SandAI-org/MagiAttention. The product can be accessed at https://sand.ai.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiTPainter: Efficient Video Inpainting with Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15661v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing video inpainting algorithms utilize optical flows to construct the corresponding maps and then propagate pixels from adjacent frames to missing areas by mapping. Despite the effectiveness of the propagation mechanism, they might encounter blurry and inconsistencies when dealing with inaccurate optical flows or large masks. Recently, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a revolutionary technique for video generation tasks. However, pretrained DiT models for video generation all contain a large amount of parameters, which makes it very time consuming to apply to video inpainting tasks. In this paper, we present DiTPainter, an end-to-end video inpainting model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiTPainter uses an efficient transformer network designed for video inpainting, which is trained from scratch instead of initializing from any large pretrained models. DiTPainter can address videos with arbitrary lengths and can be applied to video decaptioning and video completion tasks with an acceptable time cost. Experiments show that DiTPainter outperforms existing video inpainting algorithms with higher quality and better spatial-temporal consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamGen: Unlocking Generalization in Robot Learning through Neural Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12705v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DreamGen, a simple yet highly effective 4-stage pipeline for training robot policies that generalize across behaviors and environments through neural trajectories - synthetic robot data generated from video world models. DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success. Our work establishes a promising new axis for scaling robot learning well beyond manual data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>See w...</summary><p>See website for videos: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/gear/dreamgen</p></details> |

Despite its popularity in image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely underexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora, the first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video generation process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance is closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover content, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching mechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each assigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the optimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion of watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet transform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local scanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during watermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues for efficient and robust watermark protection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-Sora achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness, which is largely attributed to our proposals. We will release our code upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07344v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present GPDiT, a Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer that unifies the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive modeling for long-range video synthesis, within a continuous latent space. Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework for video modeling in continuous space.</p></details> |  |
| **[EWMBench: Evaluating Scene, Motion, and Semantic Quality in Embodied World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09694v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in creative AI have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images and videos conditioned on language instructions. Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBench), a dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages a meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field.

| **[DynamiCtrl: Rethinking the Basic Structure and the Role of Text for High-quality Human Image Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21246v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With diffusion transformer (DiT) excelling in video generation, its use in specific tasks has drawn increasing attention. However, adapting DiT for pose-guided human image animation faces two core challenges: (a) existing U-Net-based pose control methods may be suboptimal for the DiT backbone; and (b) removing text guidance, as in previous approaches, often leads to semantic loss and model degradation. To address these issues, we propose DynamiCtrl, a novel framework for human animation in video DiT architecture. Specifically, we use a shared VAE encoder for human images and driving poses, unifying them into a common latent space, maintaining pose fidelity, and eliminating the need for an expert pose encoder during video denoising. To integrate pose control into the DiT backbone effectively, we propose a novel Pose-adaptive Layer Norm model. It injects normalized pose features into the denoising process via conditioning on visual tokens, enabling seamless and scalable pose control across DiT blocks. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of text removal, we introduce the "Joint-text" paradigm, which preserves the role of text embeddings to provide global semantic context. Through full-attention blocks, image and pose features are aligned with text features, enhancing semantic consistency, leveraging pretrained knowledge, and enabling multi-level control. Experiments verify the superiority of DynamiCtrl on benchmark and self-collected data (e.g., achieving the best LPIPS of 0.166), demonstrating strong character control and high-quality synthesis.

| **[Progressive Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08151v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current frontier video diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable results at generating high-quality videos. However, they can only generate short video clips, normally around 10 seconds or 240 frames, due to computation limitations during training. Existing methods naively achieve autoregressive long video generation by directly placing the ending of the previous clip at the front of the attention window as conditioning, which leads to abrupt scene changes, unnatural motion, and error accumulation. In this work, we introduce a more natural formulation of autoregressive long video generation by revisiting the noise level assumption in video diffusion models. Our key idea is to 1. assign the frames with per-frame, progressively increasing noise levels rather than a single noise level and 2. denoise and shift the frames in small intervals rather than all at once. This allows for smoother attention correspondence among frames with adjacent noise levels, larger overlaps between the attention windows, and better propagation of information from the earlier to the later frames.

| **[This&That: Language-Gesture Controlled Video Generation for Robot Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05530v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clear, interpretable instructions are invaluable when attempting any complex task. Good instructions help to clarify the task and even anticipate the steps needed to solve it. In this work, we propose a robot learning framework for communicating, planning, and executing a wide range of tasks, dubbed This&That. This&That solves general tasks by leveraging video generative models, which, through training on internet-scale data, contain rich physical and semantic context. In this work, we tackle three fundamental challenges in video-based planning: 1) unambiguous task communication with simple human instructions, 2) controllable video generation that respects user intent, and 3) translating visual plans into robot actions. This&That uses language-gesture conditioning to generate video predictions, as a succinct and unambiguous alternative to existing language-only methods, especially in complex and uncertain environments. These video predictions are then fed into a behavior cloning architecture dubbed Diffusion Video to Action (DiVA), which outperforms prior state-of-the-art behavior cloning and video-based planning methods by substantial margins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Context Autoregressive Video Modeling with Next-Frame Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19325v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context video modeling is essential for enabling generative models to function as world simulators, as they must maintain temporal coherence over extended time spans. However, most existing models are trained on short clips, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies, even with test-time extrapolation. While training directly on long videos is a natural solution, the rapid growth of vision tokens makes it computationally prohibitive. To support exploring efficient long-context video modeling, we first establish a strong autoregressive baseline called Frame AutoRegressive (FAR). FAR models temporal dependencies between continuous frames, converges faster than video diffusion transformers, and outperforms token-level autoregressive models. Based on this baseline, we observe context redundancy in video autoregression. Nearby frames are critical for maintaining temporal consistency, whereas distant frames primarily serve as context memory. To eliminate this redundancy, we propose the long short-term context modeling using asymmetric patchify kernels, which apply large kernels to distant frames to reduce redundant tokens, and standard kernels to local frames to preserve fine-grained detail. This significantly reduces the training cost of long videos. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both short and long video generation, providing an effective baseline for long-context autoregressive video modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://farlongctx.github.io/</p></details> |

However, current AI-generated videos (AIGVs) still exhibit limitations in terms of perceptual quality and text-video alignment. Therefore, a reliable and scalable automatic model for AIGV evaluation is desirable, which heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. To this end, we present AIGVE-60K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for AI-Generated Video Evaluation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks, encompassing 3,050 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions, (ii) the largest human annotations, including 120K mean-opinion scores (MOSs) and 60K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 58,500 videos generated from 30 T2V models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both T2V generation and V2T interpretation capabilities. Based on AIGVE-60K, we propose LOVE, a LMM-based metric for AIGV Evaluation from multiple dimensions including perceptual preference, text-video correspondence, and task-specific accuracy in terms of both instance level and model level. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LOVE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AIGVE-60K dataset, but also generalizes effectively to a wide range of other AIGV evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight the significance of the AIGVE-60K dataset. Database and codes are anonymously available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LOVE.</p></details> |  |
| **[VFRTok: Variable Frame Rates Video Tokenizer with Duration-Proportional Information Assumption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12053v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates, causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to existing tokenizers.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

This paper introduces VidCapBench, a video caption evaluation scheme specifically designed for T2V generation, agnostic to any particular caption format. VidCapBench employs a data annotation pipeline, combining expert model labeling and human refinement, to associate each collected video with key information spanning video aesthetics, content, motion, and physical laws. VidCapBench then partitions these key information attributes into automatically assessable and manually assessable subsets, catering to both the rapid evaluation needs of agile development and the accuracy requirements of thorough validation. By evaluating numerous state-of-the-art captioning models, we demonstrate the superior stability and comprehensiveness of VidCapBench compared to existing video captioning evaluation approaches. Verification with off-the-shelf T2V models reveals a significant positive correlation between scores on VidCapBench and the T2V quality evaluation metrics, indicating that VidCapBench can provide valuable guidance for training T2V models.

Unlike image generation, video generation requires a substantially larger number of tokens to produce coherent temporal frames, resulting in significant overhead during the decoding phase. Our key observations are: (i) MLP modules in the decode phase dominate the inference latency, and (ii) there exists high temporal redundancy in MLP outputs of adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{FastCar} framework to accelerate the decode phase for the AR video generation by exploring the temporal redundancy. The Temporal Attention Score (TAS) is proposed to determine whether to apply the replay strategy (\textit{i.e.}, reusing cached MLP outputs from the previous frame to reduce redundant computations) with detailed theoretical analysis and justification. Also, we develop a hardware accelerator on FPGA with Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) based on TAS to enable better resource utilization and faster inference. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional sparse attention approaches with more than 2.1x decoding speedup and higher energy efficiency on the edge. Furthermore, by combining FastCar and sparse attention, FastCar can boost the performance of sparse attention with alleviated drifting, demonstrating our unique advantages for high-resolution and long-duration video generation.

| **[DraftAttention: Fast Video Diffusion via Low-Resolution Attention Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14708v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformer-based video generation models (DiTs) have recently attracted widespread attention for their excellent generation quality. However, their computational cost remains a major bottleneck-attention alone accounts for over 80% of total latency, and generating just 8 seconds of 720p video takes tens of minutes-posing serious challenges to practical application and scalability. To address this, we propose the DraftAttention, a training-free framework for the acceleration of video diffusion transformers with dynamic sparse attention on GPUs. We apply down-sampling to each feature map across frames in the compressed latent space, enabling a higher-level receptive field over the latent composed of hundreds of thousands of tokens. The low-resolution draft attention map, derived from draft query and key, exposes redundancy both spatially within each feature map and temporally across frames. We reorder the query, key, and value based on the draft attention map to guide the sparse attention computation in full resolution, and subsequently restore their original order after the attention computation. This reordering enables structured sparsity that aligns with hardware-optimized execution. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the low-resolution draft attention closely approximates the full attention, providing reliable guidance for constructing accurate sparse attention. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing sparse attention approaches in video generation quality and achieves up to 1.75x end-to-end speedup on GPUs.

Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code will be released upon acceptance</p></details> |

This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors. VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical laws.</p></details> |  |

Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding.

Toonify, a StyleGAN-based framework, has become widely used for facial image stylization. To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB. In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we employ an improved StyleGAN to generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which addresses the limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable video, which enables Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video frames, and efficiently generate high-quality animation in the next stage. In Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), we learn a stylized neutral head model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated video. By combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the effectiveness of ToonifyGB on the benchmark dataset using two styles: Arcane and Pixar.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating time-consistent dynamics with discriminator-guided image diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09089v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic temporal dynamics are crucial for many video generation, processing and modelling applications, e.g. in computational fluid dynamics, weather prediction, or long-term climate simulations. Video diffusion models (VDMs) are the current state-of-the-art method for generating highly realistic dynamics. However, training VDMs from scratch can be challenging and requires large computational resources, limiting their wider application. Here, we propose a time-consistency discriminator that enables pretrained image diffusion models to generate realistic spatiotemporal dynamics. The discriminator guides the sampling inference process and does not require extensions or finetuning of the image diffusion model. We compare our approach against a VDM trained from scratch on an idealized turbulence simulation and a real-world global precipitation dataset. Our approach performs equally well in terms of temporal consistency, shows improved uncertainty calibration and lower biases compared to the VDM, and achieves stable centennial-scale climate simulations at daily time steps.</p></details> |  |

This revolutionary force offers the most promising path yet toward solving one of engineering's grandest challenges: achieving reliable, fully autonomous driving, particularly the pursuit of Level 5 autonomy. This survey delivers a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the emerging role of GenAI across the autonomous driving stack. We begin by distilling the principles and trade-offs of modern generative modeling, encompassing VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We then map their frontier applications in image, LiDAR, trajectory, occupancy, video generation as well as LLM-guided reasoning and decision making. We categorize practical applications, such as synthetic data workflows, end-to-end driving strategies, high-fidelity digital twin systems, smart transportation networks, and cross-domain transfer to embodied AI. We identify key obstacles and possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases, evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport integration, and socio-technical influence. By unifying these threads, the survey provides a forward-looking reference for researchers, engineers, and policymakers navigating the convergence of generative AI and advanced autonomous mobility.

However, their real-world performance often falls short of user expectations. One key reason is that these models have not been trained on videos related to some topics users want to create. In this paper, we propose VideoUFO, the first Video dataset specifically curated to align with Users' FOcus in real-world scenarios. Beyond this, our VideoUFO also features: (1) minimal (0.29%) overlap with existing video datasets, and (2) videos searched exclusively via YouTube's official API under the Creative Commons license. These two attributes provide future researchers with greater freedom to broaden their training sources. The VideoUFO comprises over 1.09 million video clips, each paired with both a brief and a detailed caption (description). Specifically, through clustering, we first identify 1,291 user-focused topics from the million-scale real text-to-video prompt dataset, VidProM. Then, we use these topics to retrieve videos from YouTube, split the retrieved videos into clips, and generate both brief and detailed captions for each clip. After verifying the clips with specified topics, we are left with about 1.09 million video clips. Our experiments reveal that (1) current 16 text-to-video models do not achieve consistent performance across all user-focused topics; and (2) a simple model trained on VideoUFO outperforms others on worst-performing topics.

Instead, a few relevant individual frames are saved for documentation/reporting purposes and these are the frames on which most current colonoscopy AI models are trained on. While developing new unsupervised domain translation methods for colonoscopy (e.g. to translate between real optical and virtual/CT colonoscopy), it is thus typical to start with approaches that initially work for individual frames without temporal consistency. Once an individual-frame model has been finalized, additional contiguous frames are added with a modified deep learning architecture to train a new model from scratch for temporal consistency. This transition to temporally-consistent deep learning models, however, requires significantly more computational and memory resources for training. In this paper, we present a lightweight solution with a tunable temporal parameter, RT-GAN (Recurrent Temporal GAN), for adding temporal consistency to individual frame-based approaches that reduces training requirements by a factor of 5. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two challenging use cases in colonoscopy: haustral fold segmentation (indicative of missed surface) and realistic colonoscopy simulator video generation. We also release a first-of-its kind temporal dataset for colonoscopy for the above use cases. The datasets, accompanying code, and pretrained models will be made available on our Computational Endoscopy Platform GitHub (https://github.com/nadeemlab/CEP).

Despite the success of advanced video generation models like Sora, Kling, and CogVideoX in generating natural videos, they lack the same effectiveness in handling animation videos.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive system, AniSora, designed for animation video generation, which includes a data processing pipeline, a controllable generation model, and an evaluation benchmark. Supported by the data processing pipeline with over 10M high-quality data, the generation model incorporates a spatiotemporal mask module to facilitate key animation production functions such as image-to-video generation, frame interpolation, and localized image-guided animation. We also collect an evaluation benchmark of 948 various animation videos, with specifically developed metrics for animation video generation.

To obtain the subgoals, existing methods typically resort to video generation models but suffer from model hallucination and computational cost. We present Vis2Plan, an efficient, explainable and white-box visual planning framework powered by symbolic guidance. From raw, unlabeled play data, Vis2Plan harnesses vision foundation models to automatically extract a compact set of task symbols, which allows building a high-level symbolic transition graph for multi-goal, multi-stage planning. At test time, given a desired task goal, our planner conducts planning at the symbolic level and assembles a sequence of physically consistent intermediate sub-goal images grounded by the underlying symbolic representation. Our Vis2Plan outperforms strong diffusion video generation-based visual planners by delivering 53\% higher aggregate success rate in real robot settings while generating visual plans 35$\times$ faster. The results indicate that Vis2Plan is able to generate physically consistent image goals while offering fully inspectable reasoning steps.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, existing diffusion models predominantly concentrate on modeling static 3D scenes or object-level dynamics, constraining their capacity to provide truly immersive experiences. To address this issue, we propose HoloTime, a framework that integrates video diffusion models to generate panoramic videos from a single prompt or reference image, along with a 360-degree 4D scene reconstruction method that seamlessly transforms the generated panoramic video into 4D assets, enabling a fully immersive 4D experience for users. Specifically, to tame video diffusion models for generating high-fidelity panoramic videos, we introduce the 360World dataset, the first comprehensive collection of panoramic videos suitable for downstream 4D scene reconstruction tasks. With this curated dataset, we propose Panoramic Animator, a two-stage image-to-video diffusion model that can convert panoramic images into high-quality panoramic videos. Following this, we present Panoramic Space-Time Reconstruction, which leverages a space-time depth estimation method to transform the generated panoramic videos into 4D point clouds, enabling the optimization of a holistic 4D Gaussian Splatting representation to reconstruct spatially and temporally consistent 4D scenes. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conducted a comparative analysis with existing approaches, revealing its superiority in both panoramic video generation and 4D scene reconstruction. This demonstrates our method's capability to create more engaging and realistic immersive environments, thereby enhancing user experiences in VR and AR applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Homepage: https://zhouhyocean.github.io/holotime/ Code: https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/HoloTime</p></details> |

However, Multi-Concept Video Customization (MCVC) remains a significant challenge. We identify two key challenges for this task: 1) the identity decoupling issue, where directly adopting existing customization methods inevitably mix identity attributes when handling multiple concepts simultaneously, and 2) the scarcity of high-quality video-entity pairs, which is crucial for training a model that can well represent and decouple various customized concepts in video generation. To address these challenges, we introduce ConceptMaster, a novel framework that effectively addresses the identity decoupling issues while maintaining concept fidelity in video customization. Specifically, we propose to learn decoupled multi-concept embeddings and inject them into diffusion models in a standalone manner, which effectively guarantees the quality of customized videos with multiple identities, even for highly similar visual concepts. To overcome the scarcity of high-quality MCVC data, we establish a data construction pipeline, which enables collection of high-quality multi-concept video-entity data pairs across diverse scenarios. A multi-concept video evaluation set is further devised to comprehensively validate our method from three dimensions, including concept fidelity, identity decoupling ability, and video generation quality, across six different concept composition scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptMaster significantly outperforms previous methods for video customization tasks, showing great potential to generate personalized and semantically accurate content for video diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yuzhou914.github.io/ConceptMaster/.

This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion, HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReel-I2V), and five reward models (image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis. The code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dancegrpo.github.io/</p></details> |

To address this limitation we propose a framework that includes a dataset collection pipeline and architectural extensions to video diffusion models to enable text-to-multi-shot video generation. Our approach enables generation of multi-shot videos as a single video with full attention across all frames of all shots, ensuring character and background consistency, and allows users to control the number, duration, and content of shots through shot-specific conditioning. This is achieved by incorporating a transition token into the text-to-video model to control at which frames a new shot begins and a local attention masking strategy which controls the transition token's effect and allows shot-specific prompting. To obtain training data we propose a novel data collection pipeline to construct a multi-shot video dataset from existing single-shot video datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-video model for a few thousand iterations is enough for the model to subsequently be able to generate multi-shot videos with shot-specific control, outperforming the baselines.

Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://agnjason.github.io/HumanDiT-page/</p></details> |
| **[DAPE: Dual-Stage Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Consistent Video Editing with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07057v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation based on diffusion models presents a challenging multimodal task, with video editing emerging as a pivotal direction in this field. Recent video editing approaches primarily fall into two categories: training-required and training-free methods. While training-based methods incur high computational costs, training-free alternatives often yield suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose DAPE, a high-quality yet cost-effective two-stage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework for video editing. In the first stage, we design an efficient norm-tuning method to enhance temporal consistency in generated videos. The second stage introduces a vision-friendly adapter to improve visual quality. Additionally, we identify critical shortcomings in existing benchmarks, including limited category diversity, imbalanced object distribution, and inconsistent frame counts. To mitigate these issues, we curate a large dataset benchmark comprising 232 videos with rich annotations and 6 editing prompts, enabling objective and comprehensive evaluation of advanced methods. Extensive experiments on existing datasets (BalanceCC, LOVEU-TGVE, RAVE) and our proposed benchmark demonstrate that DAPE significantly improves temporal coherence and text-video alignment while outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[BridgeIV: Bridging Customized Image and Video Generation through Test-Time Autoregressive Identity Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06985v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both zero-shot and tuning-based customized text-to-image (CT2I) generation have made significant progress for storytelling content creation. In contrast, research on customized text-to-video (CT2V) generation remains relatively limited. Existing zero-shot CT2V methods suffer from poor generalization, while another line of work directly combining tuning-based T2I models with temporal motion modules often leads to the loss of structural and texture information. To bridge this gap, we propose an autoregressive structure and texture propagation module (STPM), which extracts key structural and texture features from the reference subject and injects them autoregressively into each video frame to enhance consistency. Additionally, we introduce a test-time reward optimization (TTRO) method to further refine fine-grained details. Quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of STPM and TTRO, demonstrating improvements of 7.8 and 13.1 in CLIP-I and DINO consistency metrics over the baseline, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jailbreaking the Text-to-Video Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06679v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generative models have achieved significant progress, driven by the rapid advancements in diffusion models, with notable examples including Pika, Luma, Kling, and Sora. Despite their remarkable generation ability, their vulnerability to jailbreak attack, i.e. to generate unsafe content, including pornography, violence, and discrimination, raises serious safety concerns. Existing efforts, such as T2VSafetyBench, have provided valuable benchmarks for evaluating the safety of text-to-video models against unsafe prompts but lack systematic studies for exploiting their vulnerabilities effectively. In this paper, we propose the \textit{first} optimization-based jailbreak attack against text-to-video models, which is specifically designed. Our approach formulates the prompt generation task as an optimization problem with three key objectives: (1) maximizing the semantic similarity between the input and generated prompts, (2) ensuring that the generated prompts can evade the safety filter of the text-to-video model, and (3) maximizing the semantic similarity between the generated videos and the original input prompts. To further enhance the robustness of the generated prompts, we introduce a prompt mutation strategy that creates multiple prompt variants in each iteration, selecting the most effective one based on the averaged score. This strategy not only improves the attack success rate but also boosts the semantic relevance of the generated video. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple text-to-video models, including Open-Sora, Pika, Luma, and Kling. The results demonstrate that our method not only achieves a higher attack success rate compared to baseline methods but also generates videos with greater semantic similarity to the original input prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProFashion: Prototype-guided Fashion Video Generation with Multiple Reference Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06537v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fashion video generation aims to synthesize temporally consistent videos from reference images of a designated character. Despite significant progress, existing diffusion-based methods only support a single reference image as input, severely limiting their capability to generate view-consistent fashion videos, especially when there are different patterns on the clothes from different perspectives. Moreover, the widely adopted motion module does not sufficiently model human body movement, leading to sub-optimal spatiotemporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose ProFashion, a fashion video generation framework leveraging multiple reference images to achieve improved view consistency and temporal coherency. To effectively leverage features from multiple reference images while maintaining a reasonable computational cost, we devise a Pose-aware Prototype Aggregator, which selects and aggregates global and fine-grained reference features according to pose information to form frame-wise prototypes, which serve as guidance in the denoising process. To further enhance motion consistency, we introduce a Flow-enhanced Prototype Instantiator, which exploits the human keypoint motion flow to guide an extra spatiotemporal attention process in the denoiser. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ProFashion, we extensively evaluate our method on the MRFashion-7K dataset we collected from the Internet. ProFashion also outperforms previous methods on the UBC Fashion dataset.</p></details> |  |

The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of diffusion-based, alignment-free video super-resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[HunyuanCustom: A Multimodal-Driven Architecture for Customized Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04512v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customized video generation aims to produce videos featuring specific subjects under flexible user-defined conditions, yet existing methods often struggle with identity consistency and limited input modalities. In this paper, we propose HunyuanCustom, a multi-modal customized video generation framework that emphasizes subject consistency while supporting image, audio, video, and text conditions. Built upon HunyuanVideo, our model first addresses the image-text conditioned generation task by introducing a text-image fusion module based on LLaVA for enhanced multi-modal understanding, along with an image ID enhancement module that leverages temporal concatenation to reinforce identity features across frames. To enable audio- and video-conditioned generation, we further propose modality-specific condition injection mechanisms: an AudioNet module that achieves hierarchical alignment via spatial cross-attention, and a video-driven injection module that integrates latent-compressed conditional video through a patchify-based feature-alignment network. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-subject scenarios demonstrate that HunyuanCustom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open- and closed-source methods in terms of ID consistency, realism, and text-video alignment. Moreover, we validate its robustness across downstream tasks, including audio and video-driven customized video generation. Our results highlight the effectiveness of multi-modal conditioning and identity-preserving strategies in advancing controllable video generation.

However, these models' ability to render precise on-screen text, such as captions or mathematical formulas, remains largely untested, posing significant challenges for applications requiring exact textual accuracy. In this work, we introduce T2VTextBench, the first human-evaluation benchmark dedicated to evaluating on-screen text fidelity and temporal consistency in text-to-video models. Our suite of prompts integrates complex text strings with dynamic scene changes, testing each model's ability to maintain detailed instructions across frames. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art systems, ranging from open-source solutions to commercial offerings, and find that most struggle to generate legible, consistent text. These results highlight a critical gap in current video generators and provide a clear direction for future research aimed at enhancing textual manipulation in video synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Replace Anyone in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19911v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of controllable human-centric video generation has witnessed remarkable progress, particularly with the advent of diffusion models. However, achieving precise and localized control over human motion in videos, such as replacing or inserting individuals while preserving desired motion patterns, still remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we present the ReplaceAnyone framework, which focuses on localized human replacement and insertion featuring intricate backgrounds. Specifically, we formulate this task as an image-conditioned video inpainting paradigm with pose guidance, utilizing a unified end-to-end video diffusion architecture that facilitates image-conditioned video inpainting within masked regions. To prevent shape leakage and enable granular local control, we introduce diverse mask forms involving both regular and irregular shapes. Furthermore, we implement an enriched visual guidance mechanism to enhance appearance alignment, a hybrid inpainting encoder to further preserve the detailed background information in the masked video, and a two-phase optimization methodology to simplify the training difficulty. ReplaceAnyone enables seamless replacement or insertion of characters while maintaining the desired pose motion and reference appearance within a single framework. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating realistic and coherent video content. The proposed ReplaceAnyone can be seamlessly applied not only to traditional 3D-UNet base models but also to DiT-based video models such as Wan2.1. The code will be available at https://github.com/ali-vilab/UniAnimate-DiT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Person Image Synthesis Using a Flow Matching Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03562v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) generates realistic person images conditioned on a target pose and a source image. This task plays a key role in various real-world applications, such as sign language video generation, AR/VR, gaming, and live streaming. In these scenarios, real-time PGPIS is critical for providing immediate visual feedback and maintaining user immersion.However, achieving real-time performance remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of synthesizing high-fidelity images from diverse and dynamic human poses. Recent diffusion-based methods have shown impressive image quality in PGPIS, but their slow sampling speeds hinder deployment in time-sensitive applications. This latency is particularly problematic in tasks like generating sign language videos during live broadcasts, where rapid image updates are required. Therefore, developing a fast and reliable PGPIS model is a crucial step toward enabling real-time interactive systems. To address this challenge, we propose a generative model based on flow matching (FM). Our approach enables faster, more stable, and more efficient training and sampling. Furthermore, the proposed model supports conditional generation and can operate in latent space, making it especially suitable for real-time PGPIS applications where both speed and quality are critical. We evaluate our proposed method, Real-Time Person Image Synthesis Using a Flow Matching Model (RPFM), on the widely used DeepFashion dataset for PGPIS tasks. Our results show that RPFM achieves near-real-time sampling speeds while maintaining performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models. Our methodology trades off a slight, acceptable decrease in generated-image accuracy for over a twofold increase in generation speed, thereby ensuring real-time performance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we analyze camera motion from a first principles perspective, uncovering insights that enable precise 3D camera manipulation without compromising synthesis quality. First, we determine that motion induced by camera movements in videos is low-frequency in nature. This motivates us to adjust train and test pose conditioning schedules, accelerating training convergence while improving visual and motion quality. Then, by probing the representations of an unconditional video diffusion transformer, we observe that they implicitly perform camera pose estimation under the hood, and only a sub-portion of their layers contain the camera information. This suggested us to limit the injection of camera conditioning to a subset of the architecture to prevent interference with other video features, leading to a 4x reduction of training parameters, improved training speed, and 10% higher visual quality. Finally, we complement the typical dataset for camera control learning with a curated dataset of 20K diverse, dynamic videos with stationary cameras. This helps the model distinguish between camera and scene motion and improves the dynamics of generated pose-conditioned videos. We compound these findings to design the Advanced 3D Camera Control (AC3D) architecture, the new state-of-the-art model for generative video modeling with camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project Page: https://snap-research.github.io/ac3d/</p></details> |

Empirical studies have demonstrated that real-world data and learning tasks exhibit low-dimensional structures, along with some noise or measurement error. The performance of transformers tends to depend on the intrinsic dimension of the data/tasks, though theoretical understandings remain largely unexplored for transformers. This work establishes a theoretical foundation by analyzing the performance of transformers for regression tasks involving noisy input data on a manifold. Specifically, the input data are in a tubular neighborhood of a manifold, while the ground truth function depends on the projection of the noisy data onto the manifold. We prove approximation and generalization errors which crucially depend on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. Our results demonstrate that transformers can leverage low-complexity structures in learning task even when the input data are perturbed by high-dimensional noise. Our novel proof technique constructs representations of basic arithmetic operations by transformers, which may hold independent interest.</p></details> |  |

However, the sensitivity of T2V generative models to input prompts highlights the critical role of prompt design in influencing generative outcomes. Prior research has predominantly relied on Large Language Models (LLMs) to align user-provided prompts with the distribution of training prompts, albeit without tailored guidance encompassing prompt vocabulary and sentence structure nuances. To this end, we introduce RAPO, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization framework. In order to address potential inaccuracies and ambiguous details generated by LLM-generated prompts. RAPO refines the naive prompts through dual optimization branches, selecting the superior prompt for T2V generation. The first branch augments user prompts with diverse modifiers extracted from a learned relational graph, refining them to align with the format of training prompts via a fine-tuned LLM. Conversely, the second branch rewrites the naive prompt using a pre-trained LLM following a well-defined instruction set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO can effectively enhance both the static and dynamic dimensions of generated videos, demonstrating the significance of prompt optimization for user-provided prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR2025, Project website: https://whynothaha.github.io/Prompt_optimizer/RAPO.html</p></details> |

These novel models provide plausible versatility, but are criticized for improper physical motion, shading and illumination, camera motion, and temporal consistency. The film industry relies on manually-edited Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) using 3D modeling software. Human-directed 3D synthetic videos address these shortcomings, but require tight collaboration between movie makers and 3D rendering experts. We introduce an automatic synthetic video generation pipeline based on Vision Large Language Model (VLM) agent collaborations. Given a language description of a video, multiple VLM agents direct various processes of the generation pipeline. They cooperate to create Blender scripts which render a video following the given description. Augmented with Blender-based movie making knowledge, the Director agent decomposes the text-based video description into sub-processes. For each sub-process, the Programmer agent produces Python-based Blender scripts based on function composing and API calling. The Reviewer agent, with knowledge of video reviewing, character motion coordinates, and intermediate screenshots, provides feedback to the Programmer agent. The Programmer agent iteratively improves scripts to yield the best video outcome. Our generated videos show better quality than commercial video generation models in five metrics on video quality and instruction-following performance. Our framework outperforms other approaches in a user study on quality, consistency, and rationality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 AI4CC Workshop</p></details> |

Existing works typically follow the isolated customized paradigm, where the subject identity or motion dynamics are customized exclusively. However, this paradigm completely ignores the intrinsic mutual constraints and synergistic interdependencies between identity and motion, resulting in identity-motion conflicts throughout the generation process that systematically degrades. To address this, we introduce DualReal, a novel framework that, employs adaptive joint training to collaboratively construct interdependencies between dimensions. Specifically, DualReal is composed of two units: (1) Dual-aware Adaptation dynamically selects a training phase (i.e., identity or motion), learns the current information guided by the frozen dimension prior, and employs a regularization strategy to avoid knowledge leakage; (2) StageBlender Controller leverages the denoising stages and Diffusion Transformer depths to guide different dimensions with adaptive granularity, avoiding conflicts at various stages and ultimately achieving lossless fusion of identity and motion patterns. We constructed a more comprehensive benchmark than existing methods. The experimental results show that DualReal improves CLIP-I and DINO-I metrics by 21.7% and 31.8% on average, and achieves top performance on nearly all motion quality metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, creating temporally consistent and realistic textures for mesh sequences remains labor-intensive for professional artists. On the other hand, while video diffusion models excel at text-driven video generation, they often lack 3D geometry awareness and struggle with achieving multi-view consistent texturing for 3D meshes. In this work, we present Tex4D, a zero-shot approach that integrates inherent 3D geometry knowledge from mesh sequences with the expressiveness of video diffusion models to produce multi-view and temporally consistent 4D textures. Given an untextured mesh sequence and a text prompt as inputs, our method enhances multi-view consistency by synchronizing the diffusion process across different views through latent aggregation in the UV space. To ensure temporal consistency, we leverage prior knowledge from a conditional video generation model for texture synthesis. However, straightforwardly combining the video diffusion model and the UV texture aggregation leads to blurry results. We analyze the underlying causes and propose a simple yet effective modification to the DDIM sampling process to address this issue. Additionally, we introduce a reference latent texture to strengthen the correlation between frames during the denoising process. To the best of our knowledge, Tex4D is the first method specifically designed for 4D scene texturing. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority in producing multi-view and multi-frame consistent videos based on untextured mesh sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://tex4d.github.io/</p></details> |

However, a key challenge remains: precise and flexible camera pose control, which is crucial for accurate viewpoint transformation and realistic simulation of scene dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PosePilot, a lightweight yet powerful framework that significantly enhances camera pose controllability in generative world models. Drawing inspiration from self-supervised depth estimation, PosePilot leverages structure-from-motion principles to establish a tight coupling between camera pose and video generation. Specifically, we incorporate self-supervised depth and pose readouts, allowing the model to infer depth and relative camera motion directly from video sequences. These outputs drive pose-aware frame warping, guided by a photometric warping loss that enforces geometric consistency across synthesized frames. To further refine camera pose estimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss, improving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot significantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both diffusion-based and auto-regressive world models. By steering camera pose with self-supervised depth, PosePilot sets a new benchmark for pose controllability, enabling physically consistent, reliable viewpoint synthesis in generative world models.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

It necessitates the use of local information from the original short frames to enhance visual and motion quality, and global information from the entire long frames to ensure appearance consistency. Existing training-free methods struggle to effectively integrate the benefits of both, as appearance and motion in videos are closely coupled, leading to motion inconsistency and visual quality. In this paper, we reveal that global and local information can be precisely decoupled into consistent appearance and motion intensity information by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), allowing for refined complementary integration of global consistency and local quality. With this insight, we propose FreePCA, a training-free long video generation paradigm based on PCA that simultaneously achieves high consistency and quality. Concretely, we decouple consistent appearance and motion intensity features by measuring cosine similarity in the principal component space. Critically, we progressively integrate these features to preserve original quality and ensure smooth transitions, while further enhancing consistency by reusing the mean statistics of the initial noise. Experiments demonstrate that FreePCA can be applied to various video diffusion models without requiring training, leading to substantial improvements.

Physics-based weather simulation requires precise reconstructions that are hard to scale to in-the-wild videos, while current video editing often lacks realism and control. In this work, we introduce WeatherWeaver, a video diffusion model that synthesizes diverse weather effects -- including rain, snow, fog, and clouds -- directly into any input video without the need for 3D modeling. Our model provides precise control over weather effect intensity and supports blending various weather types, ensuring both realism and adaptability. To overcome the scarcity of paired training data, we propose a novel data strategy combining synthetic videos, generative image editing, and auto-labeled real-world videos. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in weather simulation and removal, providing high-quality, physically plausible, and scene-identity-preserving results over various real-world videos.</p></details> |  |

Latte first extracts spatio-temporal tokens from input videos and then adopts a series of Transformer blocks to model video distribution in the latent space. In order to model a substantial number of tokens extracted from videos, four efficient variants are introduced from the perspective of decomposing the spatial and temporal dimensions of input videos. To improve the quality of generated videos, we determine the best practices of Latte through rigorous experimental analysis, including video clip patch embedding, model variants, timestep-class information injection, temporal positional embedding, and learning strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that Latte achieves state-of-the-art performance across four standard video generation datasets, i.e., FaceForensics, SkyTimelapse, UCF101, and Taichi-HD.

| **[T2VPhysBench: A First-Principles Benchmark for Physical Consistency in Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00337v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent years, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and accurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation and user engagement online. Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to respect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still violate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation, and gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading content. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic, pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark employs a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted studies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score below 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation revealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics violations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models often generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed. The results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer concrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video generation.</p></details> |  |

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Motion Models for Assessing Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00209v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A current limitation of video generative video models is that they generate plausible looking frames, but poor motion -- an issue that is not well captured by FVD and other popular methods for evaluating generated videos. Here we go beyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object interactions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point tracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare distributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as many as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show that using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition features results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal distortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal consistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models better than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point track representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video inconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors relative to prior work.

Despite significant advances in video synthesis, creating 3D videos remains challenging due to the relative scarcity of 3D video data. We propose a simple approach for transforming a text-to-video generator into a video-to-stereo generator. Given an input video, our framework automatically produces the video frames from a shifted viewpoint, enabling a compelling 3D effect. Prior and concurrent approaches for this task typically operate in multiple phases, first estimating video disparity or depth, then warping the video accordingly to produce a second view, and finally inpainting the disoccluded regions. This approach inherently fails when the scene involves specular surfaces or transparent objects. In such cases, single-layer disparity estimation is insufficient, resulting in artifacts and incorrect pixel shifts during warping. Our work bypasses these restrictions by directly synthesizing the new viewpoint, avoiding any intermediate steps. This is achieved by leveraging a pre-trained video model's priors on geometry, object materials, optics, and semantics, without relying on external geometry models or manually disentangling geometry from the synthesis process. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in complex, real-world scenarios featuring diverse object materials and compositions. See videos on https://video-eye2eye.github.io</p></details> |  |

However, challenges still persist in generating complex motions and interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce ReVision, a plug-and-play framework that explicitly integrates parameterized 3D physical knowledge into a pretrained conditional video generation model, significantly enhancing its ability to generate high-quality videos with complex motion and interactions. Specifically, ReVision consists of three stages. First, a video diffusion model is used to generate a coarse video. Next, we extract a set of 2D and 3D features from the coarse video to construct a 3D object-centric representation, which is then refined by our proposed parameterized physical prior model to produce an accurate 3D motion sequence. Finally, this refined motion sequence is fed back into the same video diffusion model as additional conditioning, enabling the generation of motion-consistent videos, even in scenarios involving complex actions and interactions. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on Stable Video Diffusion, where ReVision significantly improves motion fidelity and coherence. Remarkably, with only 1.5B parameters, it even outperforms a state-of-the-art video generation model with over 13B parameters on complex video generation by a substantial margin. Our results suggest that, by incorporating 3D physical knowledge, even a relatively small video diffusion model can generate complex motions and interactions with greater realism and controllability, offering a promising solution for physically plausible video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://revision-video.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[T2VEval: Benchmark Dataset and Objective Evaluation Method for T2V-generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08545v6)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) technology, as demonstrated by models such as Runway Gen-3, Pika, Sora, and Kling, have significantly broadened the applicability and popularity of the technology. This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of T2V-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-to-video outputs remain challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed T2VEval-Bench, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset for text-to-video quality evaluation, which contains 148 textual prompts and 1,783 videos generated by 13 T2V models. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we scored each video on four dimensions in the subjective experiment, which are overall impression, text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Based on T2VEval-Bench, we developed T2VEval, a multi-branch fusion scheme for T2V quality evaluation. T2VEval assesses videos across three branches: text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large language model. Additionally, we implemented a divide-and-conquer training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[SageAttention: Accurate 8-Bit Attention for Plug-and-play Inference Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02367v6)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transformer architecture predominates across various models. As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of $O(N^2)$, compared to $O(N)$ for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs almost no end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

| **[Simple Visual Artifact Detection in Sora-Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21334v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The December 2024 release of OpenAI's Sora, a powerful video generation model driven by natural language prompts, highlights a growing convergence between large language models (LLMs) and video synthesis. As these multimodal systems evolve into video-enabled LLMs (VidLLMs), capable of interpreting, generating, and interacting with visual content, understanding their limitations and ensuring their safe deployment becomes essential. This study investigates visual artifacts frequently found and reported in Sora-generated videos, which can compromise quality, mislead viewers, or propagate disinformation. We propose a multi-label classification framework targeting four common artifact label types: label 1: boundary / edge defects, label 2: texture / noise issues, label 3: movement / joint anomalies, and label 4: object mismatches / disappearances. Using a dataset of 300 manually annotated frames extracted from 15 Sora-generated videos, we trained multiple 2D CNN architectures (ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B3 / B4, ViT-Base). The best-performing model trained by ResNet-50 achieved an average multi-label classification accuracy of 94.14%. This work supports the broader development of VidLLMs by contributing to (1) the creation of datasets for video quality evaluation, (2) interpretable artifact-based analysis beyond language metrics, and (3) the identification of visual risks relevant to factuality and safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing Conditional Dependence via Auto-regressive Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21314v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated appealing performance in both image and video generation. However, many works discover that they struggle to capture important, high-level relationships that are present in the real world. For example, they fail to learn physical laws from data, and even fail to understand that the objects in the world exist in a stable fashion. This is due to the fact that important conditional dependence structures are not adequately captured in the vanilla diffusion models. In this work, we initiate an in-depth study on strengthening the diffusion model to capture the conditional dependence structures in the data. In particular, we examine the efficacy of the auto-regressive (AR) diffusion models for such purpose and develop the first theoretical results on the sampling error of AR diffusion models under (possibly) the mildest data assumption. Our theoretical findings indicate that, compared with typical diffusion models, the AR variant produces samples with a reduced gap in approximating the data conditional distribution. On the other hand, the overall inference time of the AR-diffusion models is only moderately larger than that for the vanilla diffusion models, making them still practical for large scale applications. We also provide empirical results showing that when there is clear conditional dependence structure in the data, the AR diffusion models captures such structure, whereas vanilla DDPM fails to do so. On the other hand, when there is no obvious conditional dependence across patches of the data, AR diffusion does not outperform DDPM.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods struggle with layout discontinuity, entity identity drift, and implausible interaction dynamics due to unconstrained cross-attention mechanisms and inadequate physics-aware reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose DyST-XL, a \textbf{training-free} framework that enhances off-the-shelf text-to-video models (e.g., CogVideoX-5B) through frame-aware control. DyST-XL integrates three key innovations: (1) A Dynamic Layout Planner that leverages large language models (LLMs) to parse input prompts into entity-attribute graphs and generates physics-aware keyframe layouts, with intermediate frames interpolated via trajectory optimization; (2) A Dual-Prompt Controlled Attention Mechanism that enforces localized text-video alignment through frame-aware attention masking, achieving precise control over individual entities; and (3) An Entity-Consistency Constraint strategy that propagates first-frame feature embeddings to subsequent frames during denoising, preserving object identity without manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that DyST-XL excels in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly improving performance on complex prompts and bridging a crucial gap in training-free video synthesis.

We propose to learn a 4D world model by training on RGB-DN (RGB, Depth, and Normal) videos. This not only surpasses traditional 2D models by incorporating detailed shape, configuration, and temporal changes into their predictions, but also allows us to effectively learn accurate inverse dynamic models for an embodied agent. Specifically, we first extend existing robotic manipulation video datasets with depth and normal information leveraging off-the-shelf models. Next, we fine-tune a video generation model on this annotated dataset, which jointly predicts RGB-DN (RGB, Depth, and Normal) for each frame. We then present an algorithm to directly convert generated RGB, Depth, and Normal videos into a high-quality 4D scene of the world. Our method ensures temporal and spatial coherence in 4D scene predictions from embodied scenarios, enables novel view synthesis for embodied environments, and facilitates policy learning that significantly outperforms those derived from prior video-based world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tesseractworld.github.io/</p></details> |

Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation. Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions. Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR'25 |

In this paper, we study the problem of generating paths in a layered graph (a variant of a directed acyclic graph) using discrete diffusion models, while guaranteeing that our generated samples are indeed paths. Our approach utilizes a simple yet effective representation for paths which we call the padded adjacency-list matrix (PALM). In addition, we show how to effectively perform classifier guidance, which helps steer the sampled paths to specific preferred edges without any retraining of the diffusion model. Our preliminary results show that empirically, our method outperforms alternatives which do not explicitly account for path constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at Frontiers in Probabilistic Inference: Sampling meets Learning (FPI) workshop at ICLR 2025. https://openreview.net/forum?id=DBdkU0Ikzy</p></details> |

The widespread accessibility of generative techniques, which allow for the production of fake multimedia from prompts or existing media, along with their continuous refinement, underscores the urgent need for highly accurate and generalizable AI-generated media detection methods, underlined also by new regulations like the European Digital AI Act. In this paper, we draw inspiration from Vision Transformer (ViT)-based fake image detection and extend this idea to video. We propose an {original} %innovative framework that effectively integrates ViT embeddings over time to enhance detection performance.

However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a $\sim$14,000$\times$ compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Kling, and Hailuo.

One particularly challenging case is the class of videos in which the intricate motion of the hand coupled with a mostly stable and otherwise distracting environment is necessary to convey the execution of some complex action and its effects. To address these challenges, we introduce a new method for video generation that focuses on hand-centric actions. Our diffusion-based method incorporates two distinct innovations. First, we propose an automatic method to generate the motion area -- the region in the video in which the detailed activities occur -- guided by both the visual context and the action text prompt, rather than assuming this region can be provided manually as is now commonplace. Second, we introduce a critical Hand Refinement Loss to guide the diffusion model to focus on smooth and consistent hand poses. We evaluate our method on challenging augmented datasets based on EpicKitchens and Ego4D, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of action clarity, especially of the hand motion in the target region, across diverse environments and actions.

Yet, the videos generated by recent works suffer from poor quality and spatiotemporal consistency, undermining their utility in advancing perception tasks under driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DiVE, a diffusion transformer-based generative framework meticulously engineered to produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent, and cross-view consistent multi-view videos, aligning seamlessly with bird's-eye view layouts and textual descriptions. DiVE leverages a unified cross-attention and a SketchFormer to exert precise control over multimodal data, while incorporating a view-inflated attention mechanism that adds no extra parameters, thereby guaranteeing consistency across views. Despite these advancements, synthesizing high-resolution videos under multimodal constraints introduces dual challenges: investigating the optimal classifier-free guidance coniguration under intricate multi-condition inputs and mitigating excessive computational latency in high-resolution rendering--both of which remain underexplored in prior researches. To resolve these limitations, we introduce two innovations: Multi-Control Auxiliary Branch Distillation, which streamlines multi-condition CFG selection while circumventing high computational overhead, and Resolution Progressive Sampling, a training-free acceleration strategy that staggers resolution scaling to reduce high latency due to high resolution. These innovations collectively achieve a 2.62x speedup with minimal quality degradation. Evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, DiVE achieves SOTA performance in multi-view video generation, yielding photorealistic outputs with exceptional temporal and cross-view coherence.</p></details> |  |

The main challenges of this task lie on the insufficiency of high-quality paired stereo videos for training and the difficulty of maintaining the spatio-temporal consistency between frames. Existing methods primarily address these issues by directly applying novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques to video, while facing limitations such as the inability to effectively represent dynamic scenes and the requirement for large amounts of training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised stereo video synthesis paradigm via a video diffusion model, termed SpatialDreamer, which meets the challenges head-on. Firstly, to address the stereo video data insufficiency, we propose a Depth based Video Generation module DVG, which employs a forward-backward rendering mechanism to generate paired videos with geometric and temporal priors. Leveraging data generated by DVG, we propose RefinerNet along with a self-supervised synthetic framework designed to facilitate efficient and dedicated training. More importantly, we devise a consistency control module, which consists of a metric of stereo deviation strength and a Temporal Interaction Learning module TIL for geometric and temporal consistency ensurance respectively.

This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.

The quality of these datasets plays a pivotal role in the performance of video generation models. We assert that temporal splitting, detailed captions, and video quality filtering are three crucial determinants of dataset quality. However, existing datasets exhibit various limitations in these areas. To address these challenges, we introduce Koala-36M, a large-scale, high-quality video dataset featuring accurate temporal splitting, detailed captions, and superior video quality. The essence of our approach lies in improving the consistency between fine-grained conditions and video content. Specifically, we employ a linear classifier on probability distributions to enhance the accuracy of transition detection, ensuring better temporal consistency. We then provide structured captions for the splitted videos, with an average length of 200 words, to improve text-video alignment. Additionally, we develop a Video Training Suitability Score (VTSS) that integrates multiple sub-metrics, allowing us to filter high-quality videos from the original corpus.

The previous studies have emphasized the significance of audio-lip synchronization and visual quality. Currently, limited attention has been given to the learning of visual uncertainty, which creates several issues in existing systems, including inconsistent visual quality and unreliable performance across different input conditions. To address the problem, we propose a Joint Uncertainty Learning Network (JULNet) for high-quality talking face video generation, which incorporates a representation of uncertainty that is directly related to visual error. Specifically, we first design an uncertainty module to individually predict the error map and uncertainty map after obtaining the generated image. The error map represents the difference between the generated image and the ground truth image, while the uncertainty map is used to predict the probability of incorrect estimates. Furthermore, to match the uncertainty distribution with the error distribution through a KL divergence term, we introduce a histogram technique to approximate the distributions. By jointly optimizing error and uncertainty, the performance and robustness of our model can be enhanced. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior high-fidelity and audio-lip synchronization in talking face video generation compared to previous methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

To address these issues, we propose SciTalk, a novel multi-LLM agentic framework, grounding videos in various sources, such as text, figures, visual styles, and avatars. Inspired by content creators' workflows, SciTalk uses specialized agents for content summarization, visual scene planning, and text and layout editing, and incorporates an iterative feedback mechanism where video agents simulate user roles to give feedback on generated videos from previous iterations and refine generation prompts. Experimental evaluations show that SciTalk outperforms simple prompting methods in generating scientifically accurate and engaging content over the refined loop of video generation. Although preliminary results are still not yet matching human creators' quality, our framework provides valuable insights into the challenges and benefits of feedback-driven video generation. Our code, data, and generated videos will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://minnesotanlp.github.io/scitalk-project-page/</p></details> |

However, generating videos with spatiotemporal consistencies remains challenging. Current methods typically utilize attention mechanisms or modify noise to achieve consistent videos, neglecting global spatiotemporal information that could help ensure spatial and temporal consistency during video generation. In this paper, we propose the NoiseController, consisting of Multi-Level Noise Decomposition, Multi-Frame Noise Collaboration, and Joint Denoising, to enhance spatiotemporal consistencies in video generation. In multi-level noise decomposition, we first decompose initial noises into scene-level foreground/background noises, capturing distinct motion properties to model multi-view foreground/background variations. Furthermore, each scene-level noise is further decomposed into individual-level shared and residual components. The shared noise preserves consistency, while the residual component maintains diversity. In multi-frame noise collaboration, we introduce an inter-view spatiotemporal collaboration matrix and an intra-view impact collaboration matrix , which captures mutual cross-view effects and historical cross-frame impacts to enhance video quality. The joint denoising contains two parallel denoising U-Nets to remove each scene-level noise, mutually enhancing video generation. We evaluate our NoiseController on public datasets focusing on video generation and downstream tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Memorization in Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21669v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, widely used for image and video generation, face a significant limitation: the risk of memorizing and reproducing training data during inference, potentially generating unauthorized copyrighted content. While prior research has focused on image diffusion models (IDMs), video diffusion models (VDMs) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we first formally define the two types of memorization in VDMs (content memorization and motion memorization) in a practical way that focuses on privacy preservation and applies to all generation types. We then introduce new metrics specifically designed to separately assess content and motion memorization in VDMs. Additionally, we curate a dataset of text prompts that are most prone to triggering memorization when used as conditioning in VDMs. By leveraging these prompts, we generate diverse videos from various open-source VDMs, successfully extracting numerous training videos from each tested model. Through the application of our proposed metrics, we systematically analyze memorization across various pretrained VDMs, including text-conditional and unconditional models, on a variety of datasets. Our comprehensive study reveals that memorization is widespread across all tested VDMs, indicating that VDMs can also memorize image training data in addition to video datasets. Finally, we propose efficient and effective detection strategies for both content and motion memorization, offering a foundational approach for improving privacy in VDMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DATA-FM Workshop @ ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Evaluation of Text-to-Video Models using Formal Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16718v5)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-video models such as Sora, Gen-3, MovieGen, and CogVideoX are pushing the boundaries of synthetic video generation, with adoption seen in fields like robotics, autonomous driving, and entertainment. As these models become prevalent, various metrics and benchmarks have emerged to evaluate the quality of the generated videos. However, these metrics emphasize visual quality and smoothness, neglecting temporal fidelity and text-to-video alignment, which are crucial for safety-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce NeuS-V, a novel synthetic video evaluation metric that rigorously assesses text-to-video alignment using neuro-symbolic formal verification techniques. Our approach first converts the prompt into a formally defined Temporal Logic (TL) specification and translates the generated video into an automaton representation. Then, it evaluates the text-to-video alignment by formally checking the video automaton against the TL specification. Furthermore, we present a dataset of temporally extended prompts to evaluate state-of-the-art video generation models against our benchmark. We find that NeuS-V demonstrates a higher correlation by over 5x with human evaluations when compared to existing metrics. Our evaluation further reveals that current video generation models perform poorly on these temporally complex prompts, highlighting the need for future work in improving text-to-video generation capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[We'll Fix it in Post: Improving Text-to-Video Generation with Neuro-Symbolic Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17180v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current text-to-video (T2V) generation models are increasingly popular due to their ability to produce coherent videos from textual prompts. However, these models often struggle to generate semantically and temporally consistent videos when dealing with longer, more complex prompts involving multiple objects or sequential events. Additionally, the high computational costs associated with training or fine-tuning make direct improvements impractical. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NeuS-E, a novel zero-training video refinement pipeline that leverages neuro-symbolic feedback to automatically enhance video generation, achieving superior alignment with the prompts. Our approach first derives the neuro-symbolic feedback by analyzing a formal video representation and pinpoints semantically inconsistent events, objects, and their corresponding frames. This feedback then guides targeted edits to the original video. Extensive empirical evaluations on both open-source and proprietary T2V models demonstrate that NeuS-E significantly enhances temporal and logical alignment across diverse prompts by almost 40%</p></details> |  |
| **[Importance-Based Token Merging for Efficient Image and Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16720v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token merging can effectively accelerate various vision systems by processing groups of similar tokens only once and sharing the results across them. However, existing token grouping methods are often ad hoc and random, disregarding the actual content of the samples. We show that preserving high-information tokens during merging - those essential for semantic fidelity and structural details - significantly improves sample quality, producing finer details and more coherent, realistic generations. Despite being simple and intuitive, this approach remains underexplored. To do so, we propose an importance-based token merging method that prioritizes the most critical tokens in computational resource allocation, leveraging readily available importance scores, such as those from classifier-free guidance in diffusion models. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple applications, including text-to-image synthesis, multi-view image generation, and video generation with various model architectures such as Stable Diffusion, Zero123++, AnimateDiff, or PixArt-$\alpha$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Video Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00200v3)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified video and action model holds significant promise for robotics, where videos provide rich scene information for action prediction, and actions provide dynamics information for video prediction. However, effectively combining video generation and action prediction remains challenging, and current video generation-based methods struggle to match the performance of direct policy learning in action accuracy and inference speed. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified Video Action model (UVA), which jointly optimizes video and action predictions to achieve both high accuracy and efficient action inference. The key lies in learning a joint video-action latent representation and decoupling video-action decoding. The joint latent representation bridges the visual and action domains, effectively modeling the relationship between video and action sequences. Meanwhile, the decoupled decoding, powered by two lightweight diffusion heads, enables high-speed action inference by bypassing video generation during inference. Such a unified framework further enables versatile functionality through masked input training. By selectively masking actions or videos, a single model can tackle diverse tasks beyond policy learning, such as forward and inverse dynamics modeling and video generation. Via an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that UVA can serve as a general-purpose solution for a wide range of robotics tasks, such as policy learning, forward/inverse dynamics and video observation prediction, without compromising performance compared to methods tailored for specific applications.

In this paper, we introduce DynPose-100K, a large-scale dataset of dynamic Internet videos annotated with camera poses. Our collection pipeline addresses filtering using a carefully combined set of task-specific and generalist models. For pose estimation, we combine the latest techniques of point tracking, dynamic masking, and structure-from-motion to achieve improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches.

Creators can express their interpretations of music naturally through visual elements. However, the creation process of music video demands proficiency in script design, video shooting, and music-video synchronization, posing significant challenges for non-professionals. Previous work has designed automated music video generation frameworks. However, they suffer from complexity in input and poor output quality. In response, we present MV-Crafter, a system capable of producing high-quality music videos with synchronized music-video rhythm and style. Our approach involves three technical modules that simulate the human creation process: the script generation module, video generation module, and music-video synchronization module. MV-Crafter leverages a large language model to generate scripts considering the musical semantics. To address the challenge of synchronizing short video clips with music of varying lengths, we propose a dynamic beat matching algorithm and visual envelope-induced warping method to ensure precise, monotonic music-video synchronization. Besides, we design a user-friendly interface to simplify the creation process with intuitive editing features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that MV-Crafter provides an effective solution for improving the quality of generated music videos.</p></details> |  |

This paper studies the problem of leveraging pretrained diffusion models for performing discriminative tasks. Specifically, we extend the discriminative capability of pretrained frozen generative diffusion models from the classification task to the more complex object detection task, by "inverting" a pretrained layout-to-image diffusion model. To this end, a gradient-based discrete optimization approach for replacing the heavy prediction enumeration process, and a prior distribution model for making more accurate use of the Bayes' rule, are proposed respectively. Empirical results show that this method is on par with basic discriminative object detection baselines on COCO dataset. In addition, our method can greatly speed up the previous diffusion-based method for classification without sacrificing accuracy.

The \textit{manifold hypothesis} states that high-dimensional data often lie on lower-dimensional manifolds within the ambient space, and is widely believed to hold in provided examples. While recent results have provided invaluable insight into how diffusion models adapt to the manifold hypothesis, they do not capture the great empirical success of these models, making this a very fruitful research direction. In this work, we study DDPMs under the manifold hypothesis and prove that they achieve rates independent of the ambient dimension in terms of score learning. In terms of sampling complexity, we obtain rates independent of the ambient dimension w.r.t. the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and $O(\sqrt{D})$ w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance. We do this by developing a new framework connecting diffusion models to the well-studied theory of extrema of Gaussian Processes.</p></details> |  |

However, the adversarial vulnerabilities of these models remain rarely explored. We observe that in T2V generation tasks, the generated videos often contain substantial redundant information not explicitly specified in the text prompts, such as environmental elements, secondary objects, and additional details, providing opportunities for malicious attackers to embed hidden harmful content. Exploiting this inherent redundancy, we introduce BadVideo, the first backdoor attack framework tailored for T2V generation. Our attack focuses on designing target adversarial outputs through two key strategies: (1) Spatio-Temporal Composition, which combines different spatiotemporal features to encode malicious information; (2) Dynamic Element Transformation, which introduces transformations in redundant elements over time to convey malicious information. Based on these strategies, the attacker's malicious target seamlessly integrates with the user's textual instructions, providing high stealthiness. Moreover, by exploiting the temporal dimension of videos, our attack successfully evades traditional content moderation systems that primarily analyze spatial information within individual frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BadVideo achieves high attack success rates while preserving original semantics and maintaining excellent performance on clean inputs. Overall, our work reveals the adversarial vulnerability of T2V models, calling attention to potential risks and misuse.

| **[Leveraging the Powerful Attention of a Pre-trained Diffusion Model for Exemplar-based Image Colorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15812v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exemplar-based image colorization aims to colorize a grayscale image using a reference color image, ensuring that reference colors are applied to corresponding input regions based on their semantic similarity. To achieve accurate semantic matching between regions, we leverage the self-attention module of a pre-trained diffusion model, which is trained on a large dataset and exhibits powerful attention capabilities. To harness this power, we propose a novel, fine-tuning-free approach based on a pre-trained diffusion model, making two key contributions. First, we introduce dual attention-guided color transfer. We utilize the self-attention module to compute an attention map between the input and reference images, effectively capturing semantic correspondences. The color features from the reference image is then transferred to the semantically matching regions of the input image, guided by this attention map, and finally, the grayscale features are replaced with the corresponding color features. Notably, we utilize dual attention to calculate attention maps separately for the grayscale and color images, achieving more precise semantic alignment. Second, we propose classifier-free colorization guidance, which enhances the transferred colors by combining color-transferred and non-color-transferred outputs. This process improves the quality of colorization. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of image quality and fidelity to the reference. Specifically, we use 335 input-reference pairs from previous research, achieving an FID of 95.27 (image quality) and an SI-FID of 5.51 (fidelity to the reference).

The approach is distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion architecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data types. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning reasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy facilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL) stage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the outset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm specifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified reward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities as a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like LLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in multimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image generation. These achievements highlight MMaDA's effectiveness in bridging the gap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion architectures, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and development.

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution,current methods struggle to simultaneously achieve stable, efficient fine-tuning and support non-differentiable rewards. Furthermore, their reliance on sparse rewards provides inadequate supervision during intermediate steps, often resulting in suboptimal generation quality. To address these limitations, dense and differentiable signals are required throughout the diffusion process. Hence, we propose VAlue-based Reinforced Diffusion (VARD): a novel approach that first learns a value function predicting expection of rewards from intermediate states, and subsequently uses this value function with KL regularization to provide dense supervision throughout the generation process. Our method maintains proximity to the pretrained model while enabling effective and stable training via backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach facilitates better trajectory guidance, improves training efficiency and extends the applicability of RL to diffusion models optimized for complex, non-differentiable reward functions.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[A Generative Diffusion Model to Solve Inverse Problems for Robust in-NICU Neonatal MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21602v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first acquisition-agnostic diffusion generative model for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to solve a range of inverse problems for shortening scan time and improving motion robustness. In-NICU MRI scanners leverage permanent magnets at lower field-strengths (i.e., below 1.5 Tesla) for non-invasive assessment of potential brain abnormalities during the critical phase of early live development, but suffer from long scan times and motion artifacts. In this setting, training data sizes are small and intrinsically suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This work trains a diffusion probabilistic generative model using such a real-world training dataset of clinical neonatal MRI by applying several novel signal processing and machine learning methods to handle the low SNR and low quantity of data. The model is then used as a statistical image prior to solve various inverse problems at inference time without requiring any retraining. Experiments demonstrate the generative model's utility for three real-world applications of neonatal MRI: accelerated reconstruction, motion correction, and super-resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICIP 2025</p></details> |

However, diffusion language models have long been constrained by slow inference. A core challenge is that their non-autoregressive architecture and bidirectional attention preclude the key-value cache that accelerates decoding. We address this bottleneck by proposing a KV-cache-like mechanism, delayed KV-Cache, for the denoising process of DLMs. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different tokens have distinct representation dynamics throughout the diffusion process. Accordingly, we propose a delayed and conditioned caching strategy for key and value states. We design two complementary variants to cache key and value step-by-step: (1) dKV-Cache-Decode, which provides almost lossless acceleration, and even improves performance on long sequences, suggesting that existing DLMs may under-utilise contextual information during inference. (2) dKV-Cache-Greedy, which has aggressive caching with reduced lifespan, achieving higher speed-ups with quadratic time complexity at the cost of some performance degradation. dKV-Cache, in final, achieves from 2-10x speedup in inference, largely narrowing the gap between ARs and DLMs. We evaluate our dKV-Cache on several benchmarks, delivering acceleration across general language understanding, mathematical, and code-generation benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that cache can also be used in DLMs, even in a training-free manner from current DLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/horseee/dKV-Cache</p></details> |
| **[Denoising Score Distillation: From Noisy Diffusion Pretraining to One-Step High-Quality Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07578v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-resolution, realistic images across diverse natural distributions. However, their performance heavily relies on high-quality training data, making it challenging to learn meaningful distributions from corrupted samples. This limitation restricts their applicability in scientific domains where clean data is scarce or costly to obtain. In this work, we introduce denoising score distillation (DSD), a surprisingly effective and novel approach for training high-quality generative models from low-quality data. DSD first pretrains a diffusion model exclusively on noisy, corrupted samples and then distills it into a one-step generator capable of producing refined, clean outputs. While score distillation is traditionally viewed as a method to accelerate diffusion models, we show that it can also significantly enhance sample quality, particularly when starting from a degraded teacher model. Across varying noise levels and datasets, DSD consistently improves generative performancewe summarize our empirical evidence in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that, in a linear model setting, DSD identifies the eigenspace of the clean data distributions covariance matrix, implicitly regularizing the generator. This perspective reframes score distillation as not only a tool for efficiency but also a mechanism for improving generative models, particularly in low-quality data settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First Author and Second Author contributed equally to this work.

However, the generated models are often fused into a single piece, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. This paper focuses on 3D garment generation, a key area for applications like virtual try-on with dynamic garment animations, which require garments to be separable and simulation-ready. We introduce Dress-1-to-3, a novel pipeline that reconstructs physics-plausible, simulation-ready separated garments with sewing patterns and humans from an in-the-wild image. Starting with the image, our approach combines a pre-trained image-to-sewing pattern generation model for creating coarse sewing patterns with a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model to produce multi-view images. The sewing pattern is further refined using a differentiable garment simulator based on the generated multi-view images. Versatile experiments demonstrate that our optimization approach substantially enhances the geometric alignment of the reconstructed 3D garments and humans with the input image. Furthermore, by integrating a texture generation module and a human motion generation module, we produce customized physics-plausible and realistic dynamic garment demonstrations.

| **[Diffusion-based Method for Satellite Pattern-of-Life Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10814v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite pattern-of-life (PoL) identification is crucial for space safety and satellite monitoring, involving the analysis of typical satellite behaviors such as station-keeping, drift, etc. However, existing PoL identification methods remain underdeveloped due to the complexity of aerospace systems, variability in satellite behaviors, and fluctuating observation sampling rates. In a first attempt, we developed a domain expertise-informed machine learning method (Expert-ML) to combine satellite orbital movement knowledge and machine learning models. The Expert-ML method achieved high accuracy results in simulation data and real-world data with normal sampling rate. However, this approach lacks of generality as it requires domain expertise and its performance degraded significantly when data sampling rate varied. To achieve generality, we propose a novel diffusion-based PoL identification method. Distinct from prior approaches, the proposed method leverages a diffusion model to achieve end-to-end identification without manual refinement or domain-specific knowledge. Specifically, we employ a multivariate time-series encoder to capture hidden representations of satellite positional data. The encoded features are subsequently incorporated as conditional information in the denoising process to generate PoL labels. Through experimentation across real-world satellite settings, our proposed diffusion-based method demonstrates its high identification quality and provides a robust solution even with reduced data sampling rates, indicating its great potential in practical satellite behavior pattern identification, tracking and related mission deployment.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose SwarmDiff, a hierarchical and scalable generative framework for swarm robots. We model the swarm's macroscopic state using Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and leverage conditional diffusion models to generate risk-aware macroscopic trajectory distributions, which then guide the generation of individual robot trajectories at the microscopic level. To ensure a balance between the swarm's optimal transportation and risk awareness, we integrate Wasserstein metrics and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Additionally, we introduce a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to improve sampling efficiency and generation quality by capturing long-range dependencies. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that SwarmDiff outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency, trajectory validity, and scalability, making it a reliable solution for swarm robotic trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faster Video Diffusion with Trainable Sparse Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13389v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable, hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both} training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling of video diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Current research explores various approaches to enhance model robustness, with Diffusion Denoised Smoothing emerging as a particularly promising technique. This method employs a pretrained diffusion model to preprocess inputs before model inference. Yet, its effectiveness remains largely unexplored beyond classification. We aim to address this gap by analyzing three datasets with four distinct downstream tasks under three different adversarial attack algorithms. Our findings reveal that while foundation models maintain resilience against conventional transformations, applying high-noise diffusion denoising to clean images without any distortions significantly degrades performance by as high as 57%. Low-noise diffusion settings preserve performance but fail to provide adequate protection across all attack types. Moreover, we introduce a novel attack strategy specifically targeting the diffusion process itself, capable of circumventing defenses in the low-noise regime. Our results suggest that the trade-off between adversarial robustness and performance remains a challenge to be addressed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at the 33rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2025)</p></details> |

While several concept erasure methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue associated with NSFW content, a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness across various scenarios remains absent. To bridge this gap, we introduce a full-pipeline toolkit specifically designed for concept erasure and conduct the first systematic study of NSFW concept erasure methods. By examining the interplay between the underlying mechanisms and empirical observations, we provide in-depth insights and practical guidance for the effective application of concept erasure methods in various real-world scenarios, with the aim of advancing the understanding of content safety in diffusion models and establishing a solid foundation for future research and development in this critical area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Responsible Diffusion Models via Constraining Text Embeddings within Safe Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15427v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable ability of diffusion models to generate high-fidelity images has led to their widespread adoption. However, concerns have also arisen regarding their potential to produce Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and exhibit social biases, hindering their practical use in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, prior work has focused on employing security filters to identify and exclude toxic text, or alternatively, fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models to erase sensitive concepts. Unfortunately, existing methods struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in the sense that they can have a significant impact on the normal model output while still failing to prevent the generation of harmful content in some cases. In this paper, we propose a novel self-discovery approach to identifying a semantic direction vector in the embedding space to restrict text embedding within a safe region. Our method circumvents the need for correcting individual words within the input text and steers the entire text prompt towards a safe region in the embedding space, thereby enhancing model robustness against all possibly unsafe prompts. In addition, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for semantic direction vector initialization to reduce the impact on the model performance for other semantics. Furthermore, our method can also be integrated with existing methods to improve their social responsibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively reduce NSFW content and mitigate social bias generated by diffusion models compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world applications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the last frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are highly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional frames that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated when the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model with long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase significantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression step). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with Causal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces unidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional frames can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every subsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it shares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage cost. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Ca2-VDM achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative video generation results and significantly improves the generation speed.

While traditional countermeasures have primarily focused on passive detection methods, this paper introduces a novel proactive defense strategy through adversarial attacks that preemptively protect facial images from being exploited by diffusion-based deepfake systems. Existing adversarial protection methods predominantly target conventional generative architectures (GANs, AEs, VAEs) and fail to address the unique challenges presented by diffusion models, which have become the predominant framework for high-quality facial deepfakes. Current diffusion-specific adversarial approaches are limited by their reliance on specific model architectures and weights, rendering them ineffective against the diverse landscape of diffusion-based deepfake implementations. Additionally, they typically employ global perturbation strategies that inadequately address the region-specific nature of facial manipulation in deepfakes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling for Bimanual Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13667v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-arm manipulation requires satisfying multiple simultaneous geometric constraints across high-dimensional configuration spaces, which poses a significant challenge for traditional planning and control methods. In this work, we propose Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling (ADCS), a generative framework that flexibly integrates both equality (e.g., relative and absolute pose constraints) and structured inequality constraints (e.g., proximity to object surfaces) into an energy-based diffusion model. Equality constraints are modeled using dedicated energy networks trained on pose differences in Lie algebra space, while inequality constraints are represented via Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and encoded into learned constraint embeddings, allowing the model to reason about complex spatial regions. A key innovation of our method is a Transformer-based architecture that learns to weight constraint-specific energy functions at inference time, enabling flexible and context-aware constraint integration. Moreover, we adopt a two-phase sampling strategy that improves precision and sample diversity by combining Langevin dynamics with resampling and density-aware re-weighting. Experimental results on dual-arm manipulation tasks show that ADCS significantly improves sample diversity and generalization across settings demanding precise coordination and adaptive constraint handling.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in image generation have enabled high-quality identity-conditional face synthesis, precise control over non-identity attributes remains challenging, and disentangling identity from these mutable factors is particularly difficult. To address these limitations, we propose a novel identity-conditional diffusion model that introduces two lightweight control modules designed to independently manipulate facial pose, expression, and emotion without compromising identity preservation. These modules are embedded within the cross-attention layers of the base diffusion model, enabling precise attribute control with minimal parameter overhead. Furthermore, our tailored training strategy, which leverages cross-attention between the identity feature and each non-identity control feature, encourages identity features to remain orthogonal to control signals, enhancing controllability and diversity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with perceptual user studies, demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of control accuracy over pose, expression, and emotion, while also improving generative diversity under identity-only conditioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages(excluding references), 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, efficiently generating high-fidelity synthetic sparse data remains a significant challenge. We introduce Sparse Data Diffusion (SDD), a novel method for generating sparse data. SDD extends continuous state-space diffusion models with an explicit representation of exact zeros by modeling sparsity through the introduction of Sparsity Bits. Empirical validation in various domains, including two scientific applications in physics and biology, demonstrates that SDD achieves high fidelity in representing data sparsity while preserving the quality of the generated data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Diffusion Transformers Efficiently via $μ$P](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15270v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that $\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT, PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 10 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |

Thus, we introduce component-controllable personalization, a new task that enables users to customize and reconfigure individual components within concepts. This task faces two challenges: semantic pollution, where undesired elements disrupt the target concept, and semantic imbalance, which causes disproportionate learning of the target concept and component. To address these, we design MagicTailor, a framework that uses Dynamic Masked Degradation to adaptively perturb unwanted visual semantics and Dual-Stream Balancing for more balanced learning of desired visual semantics. The experimental results show that MagicTailor achieves superior performance in this task and enables more personalized and creative image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025 (Project page: https://correr-zhou.github.io/MagicTailor)</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion-based Super-Resolution with Dynamic Time-Spatial Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12048v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have gained attention for their success in modeling complex distributions, achieving impressive perceptual quality in SR tasks. However, existing diffusion-based SR methods often suffer from high computational costs, requiring numerous iterative steps for training and inference. Existing acceleration techniques, such as distillation and solver optimization, are generally task-agnostic and do not fully leverage the specific characteristics of low-level tasks like super-resolution (SR). In this study, we analyze the frequency- and spatial-domain properties of diffusion-based SR methods, revealing key insights into the temporal and spatial dependencies of high-frequency signal recovery. Specifically, high-frequency details benefit from concentrated optimization during early and late diffusion iterations, while spatially textured regions demand adaptive denoising strategies. Building on these observations, we propose the Time-Spatial-aware Sampling strategy (TSS) for the acceleration of Diffusion SR without any extra training cost. TSS combines Time Dynamic Sampling (TDS), which allocates more iterations to refining textures, and Spatial Dynamic Sampling (SDS), which dynamically adjusts strategies based on image content. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TSS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer iterations, improving MUSIQ scores by 0.2 - 3.0 and outperforming the current acceleration methods with only half the number of steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cascaded Diffusion Models for Neural Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15157v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots in the real world need to perceive and move to goals in complex environments without collisions. Avoiding collisions is especially difficult when relying on sensor perception and when goals are among clutter. Diffusion policies and other generative models have shown strong performance in solving local planning problems, but often struggle at avoiding all of the subtle constraint violations that characterize truly challenging global motion planning problems. In this work, we propose an approach for learning global motion planning using diffusion policies, allowing the robot to generate full trajectories through complex scenes and reasoning about multiple obstacles along the path. Our approach uses cascaded hierarchical models which unify global prediction and local refinement together with online plan repair to ensure the trajectories are collision free. Our method outperforms (by ~5%) a wide variety of baselines on challenging tasks in multiple domains including navigation and manipulation.</p></details> | ICRA'25 |
| **[Sculpting Features from Noise: Reward-Guided Hierarchical Diffusion for Task-Optimal Feature Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15152v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature Transformation (FT) crafts new features from original ones via mathematical operations to enhance dataset expressiveness for downstream models. However, existing FT methods exhibit critical limitations: discrete search struggles with enormous combinatorial spaces, impeding practical use; and continuous search, being highly sensitive to initialization and step sizes, often becomes trapped in local optima, restricting global exploration. To overcome these limitations, DIFFT redefines FT as a reward-guided generative task. It first learns a compact and expressive latent space for feature sets using a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). A Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) then navigates this space to generate high-quality feature embeddings, its trajectory guided by a performance evaluator towards task-specific optima. This synthesis of global distribution learning (from LDM) and targeted optimization (reward guidance) produces potent embeddings, which a novel semi-autoregressive decoder efficiently converts into structured, discrete features, preserving intra-feature dependencies while allowing parallel inter-feature generation. Extensive experiments on 14 benchmark datasets show DIFFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy and robustness, with significantly lower training and inference times.</p></details> |  |

However, the language sequence is not sufficient to describe spatial-temporal details in the visual world. Alternatively, the video sequence is good at capturing such details. Motivated by this fact, we propose a concise Video-GPT in this paper by treating video as new language for visual world modeling. By analogy to next token prediction in GPT, we introduce a novel next clip diffusion paradigm for pretraining Video-GPT. Different from the previous works, this distinct paradigm allows Video-GPT to tackle both short-term generation and long-term prediction, by autoregressively denoising the noisy clip according to the clean clips in the history. Extensive experiments show our Video-GPT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video prediction, which is the key factor towards world modeling (Physics-IQ Benchmark: Video-GPT 34.97 vs. Kling 23.64 vs. Wan 20.89). Moreover, it can be well adapted on 6 mainstream video tasks in both video generation and understanding, showing its great generalization capacity in downstream.

| **[Data Augmentation and Resolution Enhancement using GANs and Diffusion Models for Tree Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15077v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban forests play a key role in enhancing environmental quality and supporting biodiversity in cities. Mapping and monitoring these green spaces are crucial for urban planning and conservation, yet accurately detecting trees is challenging due to complex landscapes and the variability in image resolution caused by different satellite sensors or UAV flight altitudes. While deep learning architectures have shown promise in addressing these challenges, their effectiveness remains strongly dependent on the availability of large and manually labeled datasets, which are often expensive and difficult to obtain in sufficient quantity. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates domain adaptation with GANs and Diffusion models to enhance the quality of low-resolution aerial images. Our proposed pipeline enhances low-resolution imagery while preserving semantic content, enabling effective tree segmentation without requiring large volumes of manually annotated data. Leveraging models such as pix2pix, Real-ESRGAN, Latent Diffusion, and Stable Diffusion, we generate realistic and structurally consistent synthetic samples that expand the training dataset and unify scale across domains. This approach not only improves the robustness of segmentation models across different acquisition conditions but also provides a scalable and replicable solution for remote sensing scenarios with scarce annotation resources. Experimental results demonstrated an improvement of over 50% in IoU for low-resolution images, highlighting the effectiveness of our method compared to traditional pipelines.</p></details> | 18 pages, 13 figures |

These artifacts can compromise diagnostic utility, particularly for dynamic imaging. We propose a novel alternating minimization framework that leverages a bespoke diffusion model to jointly reconstruct and correct non-rigid motion-corrupted k-space data. The diffusion model uses a coarse-to-fine denoising strategy to capture large overall motion and reconstruct the lower frequencies of the image first, providing a better inductive bias for motion estimation than that of standard diffusion models. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on both real-world cine cardiac MRI datasets and complex simulated rigid and non-rigid deformations, even when each motion state is undersampled by a factor of 64x. Additionally, our method is agnostic to sampling patterns, anatomical variations, and MRI scanning protocols, as long as some low frequency components are sampled during each motion state.</p></details> | ICIP 2025 |
| **[RadioDiff-Inverse: Diffusion Enhanced Bayesian Inverse Estimation for ISAC Radio Map Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14298v3)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio maps (RMs) are essential for environment-aware communication and sensing, providing location-specific wireless channel information. Existing RM construction methods often rely on precise environmental data and base station (BS) locations, which are not always available in dynamic or privacy-sensitive environments. While sparse measurement techniques reduce data collection, the impact of noise in sparse data on RM accuracy is not well understood. This paper addresses these challenges by formulating RM construction as a Bayesian inverse problem under coarse environmental knowledge and noisy sparse measurements. Although maximum a posteriori (MAP) filtering offers an optimal solution, it requires a precise prior distribution of the RM, which is typically unavailable. To solve this, we propose RadioDiff-Inverse, a diffusion-enhanced Bayesian inverse estimation framework that uses an unconditional generative diffusion model to learn the RM prior. This approach not only reconstructs the spatial distribution of wireless channel features but also enables environmental structure perception, such as building outlines, and location of BS just relay on pathloss, through integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Remarkably, RadioDiff-Inverse is training-free, leveraging a pre-trained model from Imagenet without task-specific fine-tuning, which significantly reduces the training cost of using generative large model in wireless networks. Experimental results demonstrate that RadioDiff-Inverse achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy of RM construction and environmental reconstruction, and robustness against noisy sparse sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, a fundamental limitation of LLM embeddings lies in the unidirectional attention used during autoregressive pre-training, which misaligns with the bidirectional nature of text embedding tasks. To this end, We propose adopting diffusion language models for text embeddings, motivated by their inherent bidirectional architecture and recent success in matching or surpassing LLMs especially on reasoning tasks. We present the first systematic study of the diffusion language embedding model, which outperforms the LLM-based embedding model by 20% on long-document retrieval, 8% on reasoning-intensive retrieval, 2% on instruction-following retrieval, and achieve competitive performance on traditional text embedding benchmarks. Our analysis verifies that bidirectional attention is crucial for encoding global context in long and complex text.</p></details> |  |
| **[VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12332v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcing the Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought with Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10446v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought (DCoLT), a reasoning framework for diffusion language models. DCoLT treats each intermediate step in the reverse diffusion process as a latent "thinking" action and optimizes the entire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on the correctness of the final answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal, linear thinking process, DCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with no strict rule on grammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of thought. We implement DCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models (DLMs). First, we choose SEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete diffusion model, where its concrete score derives a probabilistic policy to maximize the RL reward over the entire sequence of intermediate diffusion steps. We further consider the discrete-time masked diffusion language model -- LLaDA, and find that the order to predict and unmask tokens plays an essential role to optimize its RL action resulting from the ranking-based Unmasking Policy Module (UPM) defined by the Plackett-Luce model. Experiments on both math and code generation tasks show that using only public data and 16 H800 GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform other DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even both. Notably, DCoLT-reinforced LLaDA boosts its reasoning accuracy by +9.8%, +5.7%, +11.4%, +19.5% on GSM8K, MATH, MBPP, and HumanEval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Detection of Distribution Shift in Inverse Problems using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11482v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are widely used as priors in imaging inverse problems. However, their performance often degrades under distribution shifts between the training and test-time images. Existing methods for identifying and quantifying distribution shifts typically require access to clean test images, which are almost never available while solving inverse problems (at test time). We propose a fully unsupervised metric for estimating distribution shifts using only indirect (corrupted) measurements and score functions from diffusion models trained on different datasets. We theoretically show that this metric estimates the KL divergence between the training and test image distributions. Empirically, we show that our score-based metric, using only corrupted measurements, closely approximates the KL divergence computed from clean images. Motivated by this result, we show that aligning the out-of-distribution score with the in-distribution score -- using only corrupted measurements -- reduces the KL divergence and leads to improved reconstruction quality across multiple inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

In many real-world applications, we often have access to large, expensively trained unconditional diffusion models, which we aim to exploit for improving conditional sampling. Most recent approaches are motivated heuristically and lack a unifying framework, obscuring connections between them. Further, they often suffer from issues such as being very sensitive to hyperparameters, being expensive to train or needing access to weights hidden behind a closed API. In this work, we unify conditional training and sampling using the mathematically well-understood Doob's h-transform. This new perspective allows us to unify many existing methods under a common umbrella. Under this framework, we propose DEFT (Doob's h-transform Efficient FineTuning), a new approach for conditional generation that simply fine-tunes a very small network to quickly learn the conditional $h$-transform, while keeping the larger unconditional network unchanged. DEFT is much faster than existing baselines while achieving state-of-the-art performance across a variety of linear and non-linear benchmarks. On image reconstruction tasks, we achieve speedups of up to 1.6$\times$, while having the best perceptual quality on natural images and reconstruction performance on medical images. Further, we also provide initial experiments on protein motif scaffolding and outperform reconstruction guidance methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.09236</p></details> |

We collect high-speed under-sampled B-mode corneal images and apply a deep learning-based up-sampling pipeline to build realistic training pairs. Evaluations on in vivo and ex vivo fish-eye corneal models show that PnP-DM outperforms conventional 2D-UNet baselines, producing sharper structures and better noise suppression. This approach advances high-fidelity OCT imaging in high-speed acquisition for clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the sparser interactions between users and bundles raise a big challenge, especially in cold-start scenarios. Traditional collaborative filtering methods do not work well for this kind of problem because these models rely on interactions to update the latent embedding, which is hard to work in a cold-start setting. We propose a new approach (DisCo), which relies on a personalized Diffusion backbone, enhanced by disentangled aspects for the user's interest, to generate a bundle in distribution space for each user to tackle the cold-start challenge. During the training phase, DisCo adjusts an additional objective loss term to avoid bias, a prevalent issue while using the generative model for top-$K$ recommendation purposes. Our empirical experiments show that DisCo outperforms five comparative baselines by a large margin on three real-world datasets. Thereby, this study devises a promising framework and essential viewpoints in cold-start recommendation.

In this work, we propose GRAT (\textbf{GR}ouping first, \textbf{AT}tending smartly), a training-free attention acceleration strategy for fast image and video generation without compromising output quality. The key insight is to exploit the inherent sparsity in learned attention maps (which tend to be locally focused) in pretrained Diffusion Transformers and leverage better GPU parallelism. Specifically, GRAT first partitions contiguous tokens into non-overlapping groups, aligning both with GPU execution patterns and the local attention structures learned in pretrained generative Transformers. It then accelerates attention by having all query tokens within the same group share a common set of attendable key and value tokens. These key and value tokens are further restricted to structured regions, such as surrounding blocks or criss-cross regions, significantly reducing computational overhead (e.g., attaining a \textbf{35.8$\times$} speedup over full attention when generating $8192\times 8192$ images) while preserving essential attention patterns and long-range context. We validate GRAT on pretrained Flux and HunyuanVideo for image and video generation, respectively. In both cases, GRAT achieves substantially faster inference without any fine-tuning, while maintaining the performance of full attention. We hope GRAT will inspire future research on accelerating Diffusion Transformers for scalable visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at oliverrensu.github.io/project/GRAT</p></details> |

| **[StainDiffuser: MultiTask Dual Diffusion Model for Virtual Staining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11340v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is widely regarded as the standard in pathology for diagnosing diseases and tracking tumor recurrence. While H&E staining shows tissue structures, it lacks the ability to reveal specific proteins that are associated with disease severity and treatment response. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains use antibodies to highlight the expression of these proteins on their respective cell types, improving diagnostic accuracy, and assisting with drug selection for treatment. Despite their value, IHC stains require additional time and resources, limiting their utilization in some clinical settings. Recent advances in deep learning have positioned Image-to-Image (I2I) translation as a computational, cost-effective alternative for IHC. I2I generates high fidelity stain transformations digitally, potentially replacing manual staining in IHC. Diffusion models, the current state of the art in image generation and conditional tasks, are particularly well suited for virtual IHC due to their ability to produce high quality images and resilience to mode collapse. However, these models require extensive and diverse datasets (often millions of samples) to achieve a robust performance, a challenge in virtual staining applications where only thousands of samples are typically available. Inspired by the success of multitask deep learning models in scenarios with limited data, we introduce STAINDIFFUSER, a novel multitask diffusion architecture tailored to virtual staining that achieves convergence with smaller datasets. STAINDIFFUSER simultaneously trains two diffusion processes: (a) generating cell specific IHC stains from H&E images and (b) performing H&E based cell segmentation, utilizing coarse segmentation labels exclusively during training. STAINDIFFUSER generates high-quality virtual stains for two markers, outperforming over twenty I2I baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Integrate Diffusion ODEs by Averaging the Derivatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14502v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To accelerate diffusion model inference, numerical solvers perform poorly at extremely small steps, while distillation techniques often introduce complexity and instability. This work presents an intermediate strategy, balancing performance and cost, by learning ODE integration using loss functions derived from the derivative-integral relationship, inspired by Monte Carlo integration and Picard iteration. From a geometric perspective, the losses operate by gradually extending the tangent to the secant, thus are named as secant losses. The secant losses can rapidly convert (via fine-tuning or distillation) a pretrained diffusion model into its secant version. In our experiments, the secant version of EDM achieves a $10$-step FID of $2.14$ on CIFAR-10, while the secant version of SiT-XL/2 attains a $4$-step FID of $2.27$ and an $8$-step FID of $1.96$ on ImageNet-$256\times256$.

| **[Whitened Score Diffusion: A Structured Prior for Imaging Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10311v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance matrices in the denoising score matching training objective \cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel framework based on stochastic differential equations that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with flow matching for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise. Our code is open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/jeffreyalido/wsdiffusion}{\texttt{github.com/jeffreyalido/wsdiffusion}}.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Practical Guide for Incorporating Symmetry in Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13431v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, equivariant neural networks for policy learning have shown promising improvements in sample efficiency and generalization, however, their wide adoption faces substantial barriers due to implementation complexity. Equivariant architectures typically require specialized mathematical formulations and custom network design, posing significant challenges when integrating with modern policy frameworks like diffusion-based models. In this paper, we explore a number of straightforward and practical approaches to incorporate symmetry benefits into diffusion policies without the overhead of full equivariant designs. Specifically, we investigate (i) invariant representations via relative trajectory actions and eye-in-hand perception, (ii) integrating equivariant vision encoders, and (iii) symmetric feature extraction with pretrained encoders using Frame Averaging. We first prove that combining eye-in-hand perception with relative or delta action parameterization yields inherent SE(3)-invariance, thus improving policy generalization. We then perform a systematic experimental study on those design choices for integrating symmetry in diffusion policies, and conclude that an invariant representation with equivariant feature extraction significantly improves the policy performance. Our method achieves performance on par with or exceeding fully equivariant architectures while greatly simplifying implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CtrlDiff: Boosting Large Diffusion Language Models with Dynamic Block Prediction and Controllable Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14455v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although autoregressive models have dominated language modeling in recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative paradigms to the conventional next-token prediction framework. Diffusion-based language models have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel generation capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are often constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to combine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks, modeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete diffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the preceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered by two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible control mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed granularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language models. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive framework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on local semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a classifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which significantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient post-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the performance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables effective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Mechanism for LLM-based Agents Dynamic Diffusion under Information Asymmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13160v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have been used to simulate human society using multi-agent systems. Most current social simulation research emphasizes interactive behaviors in fixed environments, ignoring information opacity, relationship variability, and diffusion diversity. In this paper, we first propose a general framework for exploring multi-agent information diffusion. We identified LLMs' deficiency in the perception and utilization of social relationships, as well as diverse actions. Then, we designed a dynamic attention mechanism to help agents allocate attention to different information, addressing the limitations of the LLM attention mechanism. Agents start by responding to external information stimuli within a five-agent group, increasing group size and forming information circles while developing relationships and sharing information. Additionally, we explore the information diffusion features in the asymmetric open environment by observing the evolution of information gaps, diffusion patterns, and the accumulation of social capital, which are closely linked to psychological, sociological, and communication theories.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[One-Step Offline Distillation of Diffusion-based Models via Koopman Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13358v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional performance, yet their iterative sampling procedures remain computationally expensive. A prominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline distillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity, and flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a principled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed through the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools can be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose structured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on these observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model KDM, a novel offline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory-a classical framework for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space. KDM encodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator propagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples. This enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We provide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions, the learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman representation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with semantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory alignment. Empirically, KDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard offline distillation benchmarks, improving FID scores by up to 40% in a single generation step. All implementation details and code for the experimental setups are provided in our GitHub - https://github.com/azencot-group/KDM, or in our project page - https://sites.google.com/view/koopman-distillation-model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Model as a Noise-Aware Latent Reward Model for Step-Level Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01051v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference optimization for diffusion models aims to align them with human preferences for images. Previous methods typically use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as pixel-level reward models to approximate human preferences. However, when used for step-level preference optimization, these models face challenges in handling noisy images of different timesteps and require complex transformations into pixel space. In this work, we show that pre-trained diffusion models are naturally suited for step-level reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process latent images at various noise levels. Accordingly, we propose the Latent Reward Model (LRM), which repurposes components of the diffusion model to predict preferences of latent images at arbitrary timesteps. Building on LRM, we introduce Latent Preference Optimization (LPO), a step-level preference optimization method conducted directly in the noisy latent space. Experimental results indicate that LPO significantly improves the model's alignment with general, aesthetic, and text-image alignment preferences, while achieving a 2.5-28x training speedup over existing preference optimization methods.

However, existing world models often require extensive domain-specific training and still produce low-fidelity, coarse predictions, limiting their applicability in complex environments. In contrast, video diffusion models trained on large, internet-scale datasets have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality videos that capture diverse real-world dynamics. In this work, we present Vid2World, a general approach for leveraging and transferring pre-trained video diffusion models into interactive world models. To bridge the gap, Vid2World performs casualization of a pre-trained video diffusion model by crafting its architecture and training objective to enable autoregressive generation. Furthermore, it introduces a causal action guidance mechanism to enhance action controllability in the resulting interactive world model. Extensive experiments in robot manipulation and game simulation domains show that our method offers a scalable and effective approach for repurposing highly capable video diffusion models to interactive world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://knightnemo.github.io/vid2world/</p></details> |

However, existing methods struggle with under-erasure, leaving residual traces of targeted concepts, or over-erasure, mistakenly eliminating unrelated but visually similar concepts. To address these limitations, we introduce CRCE, a novel concept erasure framework that leverages Large Language Models to identify both semantically related concepts that should be erased alongside the target and distinct concepts that should be preserved. By explicitly modelling coreferential and retained concepts semantically, CRCE enables more precise concept removal, without unintended erasure. Experiments demonstrate that CRCE outperforms existing methods on diverse erasure tasks, including real-world object, person identities, and abstract intellectual property characteristics. The constructed dataset CorefConcept and the source code will be release upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instructing Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Classifier-Guided Semantic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14254v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality image generation and editing. Many existing approaches rely on text prompts as editing guidance. However, these methods are constrained by the need for manual prompt crafting, which can be time-consuming, introduce irrelevant details, and significantly limit editing performance. In this work, we propose optimizing semantic embeddings guided by attribute classifiers to steer text-to-image models toward desired edits, without relying on text prompts or requiring any training or fine-tuning of the diffusion model. We utilize classifiers to learn precise semantic embeddings at the dataset level. The learned embeddings are theoretically justified as the optimal representation of attribute semantics, enabling disentangled and accurate edits. Experiments further demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of disentanglement and strong generalization across different domains of data.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffEyeSyn: Diffusion-based User-specific Eye Movement Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01240v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-frequency gaze data contains more user-specific information than low-frequency data, promising for various applications. However, existing gaze modelling methods focus on low-frequency data, ignoring user-specific subtle eye movements in high-frequency eye movements. We present DiffEyeSyn -- the first computational method to synthesise eye movements specific to individual users. The key idea is to consider the user-specific information as a special type of noise in eye movement data. This perspective reshapes eye movement synthesis into the task of injecting this user-specific noise into any given eye movement sequence. We formulate this injection task as a conditional diffusion process in which the synthesis is conditioned on user-specific embeddings extracted from the gaze data using pre-trained models for user authentication. We propose user identity guidance -- a novel loss function that allows our model to preserve user identity while generating human-like eye movements in the spatial domain. Experiments on two public datasets show that our synthetic eye movements preserve user-specific characteristics and are more realistic than baseline approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiffEyeSyn can synthesise large-scale gaze data and support various downstream tasks, such as gaze-based user identification. As such, our work lays the methodological foundations for personalised eye movement synthesis that has significant application potential, such as for character animation, eye movement biometrics, and gaze data imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected bugs in creating visualisations</p></details> |
| **[LMP: Leveraging Motion Prior in Zero-Shot Video Generation with Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14167v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large-scale pre-trained diffusion transformer models have made significant progress in video generation. While current DiT models can produce high-definition, high-frame-rate, and highly diverse videos, there is a lack of fine-grained control over the video content. Controlling the motion of subjects in videos using only prompts is challenging, especially when it comes to describing complex movements. Further, existing methods fail to control the motion in image-to-video generation, as the subject in the reference image often differs from the subject in the reference video in terms of initial position, size, and shape. To address this, we propose the Leveraging Motion Prior (LMP) framework for zero-shot video generation. Our framework harnesses the powerful generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion transformers to enable motion in the generated videos to reference user-provided motion videos in both text-to-video and image-to-video generation. To this end, we first introduce a foreground-background disentangle module to distinguish between moving subjects and backgrounds in the reference video, preventing interference in the target video generation. A reweighted motion transfer module is designed to allow the target video to reference the motion from the reference video. To avoid interference from the subject in the reference video, we propose an appearance separation module to suppress the appearance of the reference subject in the target video. We annotate the DAVIS dataset with detailed prompts for our experiments and design evaluation metrics to validate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in generation quality, prompt-video consistency, and control capability.

| **[ReactDiff: Latent Diffusion for Facial Reaction Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14151v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the audio-visual clip of the speaker, facial reaction generation aims to predict the listener's facial reactions. The challenge lies in capturing the relevance between video and audio while balancing appropriateness, realism, and diversity. While prior works have mostly focused on uni-modal inputs or simplified reaction mappings, recent approaches such as PerFRDiff have explored multi-modal inputs and the one-to-many nature of appropriate reaction mappings. In this work, we propose the Facial Reaction Diffusion (ReactDiff) framework that uniquely integrates a Multi-Modality Transformer with conditional diffusion in the latent space for enhanced reaction generation. Unlike existing methods, ReactDiff leverages intra- and inter-class attention for fine-grained multi-modal interaction, while the latent diffusion process between the encoder and decoder enables diverse yet contextually appropriate outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that ReactDiff significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a facial reaction correlation of 0.26 and diversity score of 0.094 while maintaining competitive realism.

| **[DragLoRA: Online Optimization of LoRA Adapters for Drag-based Image Editing in Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12427v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drag-based editing within pretrained diffusion model provides a precise and flexible way to manipulate foreground objects. Traditional methods optimize the input feature obtained from DDIM inversion directly, adjusting them iteratively to guide handle points towards target locations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited accuracy due to the low representation ability of the feature in motion supervision, as well as inefficiencies caused by the large search space required for point tracking. To address these limitations, we present DragLoRA, a novel framework that integrates LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters into the drag-based editing pipeline. To enhance the training of LoRA adapters, we introduce an additional denoising score distillation loss which regularizes the online model by aligning its output with that of the original model. Additionally, we improve the consistency of motion supervision by adapting the input features using the updated LoRA, giving a more stable and accurate input feature for subsequent operations. Building on this, we design an adaptive optimization scheme that dynamically toggles between two modes, prioritizing efficiency without compromising precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DragLoRA significantly enhances the control precision and computational efficiency for drag-based image editing.

| **[DiffDesign: Controllable Diffusion with Meta Prior for Efficient Interior Design Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16301v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interior design is a complex and creative discipline involving aesthetics, functionality, ergonomics, and materials science. Effective solutions must meet diverse requirements, typically producing multiple deliverables such as renderings and design drawings from various perspectives. Consequently, interior design processes are often inefficient and demand significant creativity. With advances in machine learning, generative models have emerged as a promising means of improving efficiency by creating designs from text descriptions or sketches. However, few generative works focus on interior design, leading to substantial discrepancies between outputs and practical needs, such as differences in size, spatial scope, and the lack of controllable generation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DiffDesign, a controllable diffusion model with meta priors for efficient interior design generation. Specifically, we utilize the generative priors of a 2D diffusion model pre-trained on a large image dataset as our rendering backbone. We further guide the denoising process by disentangling cross-attention control over design attributes, such as appearance, pose, and size, and introduce an optimal transfer-based alignment module to enforce view consistency. Simultaneously, we construct an interior design-specific dataset, DesignHelper, consisting of over 400 solutions across more than 15 spatial types and 15 design styles. This dataset helps fine-tune DiffDesign. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DiffDesign.</p></details> | 32 pages |

Sampling from pre-trained DPMs involves multiple neural function evaluations (NFEs) to transform Gaussian noise samples into images, resulting in higher computational costs compared to single-step generative models such as GANs or VAEs. Therefore, reducing the number of NFEs while preserving generation quality is crucial. To address this, we propose LD3, a lightweight framework designed to learn the optimal time discretization for sampling. LD3 can be combined with various samplers and consistently improves generation quality without having to retrain resource-intensive neural networks. We demonstrate analytically and empirically that LD3 improves sampling efficiency with much less computational overhead. We evaluate our method with extensive experiments on 7 pre-trained models, covering unconditional and conditional sampling in both pixel-space and latent-space DPMs. We achieve FIDs of 2.38 (10 NFE), and 2.27 (10 NFE) on unconditional CIFAR10 and AFHQv2 in 5-10 minutes of training. LD3 offers an efficient approach to sampling from pre-trained diffusion models. Code is available at https://github.com/vinhsuhi/LD3.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rao-Blackwell Gradient Estimators for Equivariant Denoising Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09890v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In domains such as molecular and protein generation, physical systems exhibit inherent symmetries that are critical to model. Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator incorporating the loss and sampling procedure through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks. Additionally, it enhances protein designability in protein structure generation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the challenge of adaptive inference-time scaling-dynamically adjusting computational effort during inference-and propose Adaptive Bi-directional Cyclic Diffusion (ABCD), a flexible, search-based inference framework. ABCD refines outputs through bi-directional diffusion cycles while adaptively controlling exploration depth and termination. It comprises three components: Cyclic Diffusion Search, Automatic Exploration-Exploitation Balancing, and Adaptive Thinking Time. Experiments show that ABCD improves performance across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-Efficient Diffusion Denoising Parallelization via Reuse-then-Predict Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14741v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models across various modalities, including image, video, and audio synthesis. However, their deployment is often limited by significant inference latency, primarily due to the inherently sequential nature of the denoising process. While existing parallelization strategies attempt to accelerate inference by distributing computation across multiple devices, they typically incur high communication overhead, hindering deployment on commercial hardware. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{ParaStep}, a novel parallelization method based on a reuse-then-predict mechanism that parallelizes diffusion inference by exploiting similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike prior approaches that rely on layer-wise or stage-wise communication, ParaStep employs lightweight, step-wise communication, substantially reducing overhead. ParaStep achieves end-to-end speedups of up to \textbf{3.88}$\times$ on SVD, \textbf{2.43}$\times$ on CogVideoX-2b, and \textbf{6.56}$\times$ on AudioLDM2-large, while maintaining generation quality. These results highlight ParaStep as a scalable and communication-efficient solution for accelerating diffusion inference, particularly in bandwidth-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

The training process of such a model is controlled by a loss function which measures the difference between the noise that was added in the forward process and the noise that was predicted by the diffusion model. This enables the generation of realistic data. However, the randomness within the process and the loss function itself makes it difficult to estimate the quality of the data. Therefore, we examine multiple similarity metrics and adapt an existing metric to overcome this issue by monitoring the training and synthetisation process using those metrics. The adapted metric can even be fine-tuned on the input data to comply with the requirements of an underlying classification task. We were able to significantly reduce the amount of training epochs without a performance reduction in the classification task. An optimized training process not only saves resources, but also reduces the time for training generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Deterministic Enhanced Conditions with Dual-Streaming Encoding for Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13983v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based speech enhancement (SE) models need to incorporate correct prior knowledge as reliable conditions to generate accurate predictions. However, providing reliable conditions using noisy features is challenging. One solution is to use features enhanced by deterministic methods as conditions. However, the information distortion and loss caused by deterministic methods might affect the diffusion process. In this paper, we first investigate the effects of using different deterministic SE models as conditions for diffusion. We validate two conditions depending on whether the noisy feature was used as part of the condition: one using only the deterministic feature (deterministic-only), and the other using both deterministic and noisy features (deterministic-noisy). Preliminary investigation found that using deterministic enhanced conditions improves hearing experiences on real data, while the choice between using deterministic-only or deterministic-noisy conditions depends on the deterministic models. Based on these findings, we propose a dual-streaming encoding Repair-Diffusion Model for SE (DERDM-SE) to more effectively utilize both conditions. Moreover, we found that fine-grained deterministic models have greater potential in objective evaluation metrics, while UNet-based deterministic models provide more stable diffusion performance. Therefore, in the DERDM-SE, we propose a deterministic model that combines coarse- and fine-grained processing. Experimental results on CHiME4 show that the proposed models effectively leverage deterministic models to achieve better SE evaluation scores, along with more stable performance compared to other diffusion-based SE models.</p></details> |  |

Our method leverages diffusion inversion and timestep-specific null-text embeddings to preserve the structural integrity of the source image. By introducing a stage-wise latent injection strategy-shape injection in early steps and attribute injection in later steps-we enable precise, fine-grained modifications while maintaining global consistency. Cross-attention with reference latents facilitates semantic alignment between the source and reference. Extensive experiments across expression transfer, texture transformation, and style infusion demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, confirming the method's scalability and adaptability to diverse image editing scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, when employed for object removal tasks, they still encounter issues such as generating random artifacts and the incapacity to repaint foreground object areas with appropriate content after removal. To tackle these problems, we propose Attentive Eraser, a tuning-free method to empower pre-trained diffusion models for stable and effective object removal. Firstly, in light of the observation that the self-attention maps influence the structure and shape details of the generated images, we propose Attention Activation and Suppression (ASS), which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism within the pre-trained diffusion models based on the given mask, thereby prioritizing the background over the foreground object during the reverse generation process. Moreover, we introduce Self-Attention Redirection Guidance (SARG), which utilizes the self-attention redirected by ASS to guide the generation process, effectively removing foreground objects within the mask while simultaneously generating content that is both plausible and coherent. Experiments demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of Attentive Eraser in object removal across a variety of pre-trained diffusion models, outperforming even training-based methods. Furthermore, Attentive Eraser can be implemented in various diffusion model architectures and checkpoints, enabling excellent scalability.

However, the same physical system can exhibit significantly different dynamic behaviors in various environments. This causes prediction functions trained for specific environments to fail when transferred to unseen environments. Therefore, cross-environment prediction requires modeling the dynamic functions of different environments. In this work, we propose a model weight generation method, \texttt{EnvAd-Diff}. \texttt{EnvAd-Diff} operates in the weight space of the dynamic function, generating suitable weights from scratch based on environmental condition for zero-shot prediction. Specifically, we first train expert prediction functions on dynamic trajectories from a limited set of visible environments to create a model zoo, thereby constructing sample pairs of prediction function weights and their corresponding environments. Subsequently, we train a latent space diffusion model conditioned on the environment to model the joint distribution of weights and environments. Considering the lack of environmental prior knowledge in real-world scenarios, we propose a physics-informed surrogate label to distinguish different environments. Generalization experiments across multiple systems demonstrate that a 1M parameter prediction function generated by \texttt{EnvAd-Diff} outperforms a pre-trained 500M parameter foundation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Domain Diffusion with Progressive Alignment for Efficient Adaptive Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13907v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, while maintaining low storage cost and high retrieval efficiency. However, existing methods typically fail to address potential noise in the target domain, and directly align high-level features across domains, thus resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Diffusion with Progressive Alignment method (COUPLE). This approach revisits unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval from a graph diffusion perspective, simulating cross-domain adaptation dynamics to achieve a stable target domain adaptation process. First, we construct a cross-domain relationship graph and leverage noise-robust graph flow diffusion to simulate the transfer dynamics from the source domain to the target domain, identifying lower noise clusters. We then leverage the graph diffusion results for discriminative hash code learning, effectively learning from the target domain while reducing the negative impact of noise. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical Mixup operation for progressive domain alignment, which is performed along the cross-domain random walk paths. Utilizing target domain discriminative hash learning and progressive domain alignment, COUPLE enables effective domain adaptive hash learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate COUPLE's effectiveness on competitive benchmarks.</p></details> | IEEE TIP |

Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic global information modeling transformers, which face significant computational cost when processing high-resolution images. We empirically analyze that latent space image generation does not exhibit a strong dependence on global information as traditionally assumed. Most of the layers in the model demonstrate redundancy in global computation. In addition, conventional attention mechanisms exhibit low-frequency inertia issues. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{P}seudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{W}indow \textbf{A}ttention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global model redundancy. PSWA achieves intermediate global-local information interaction through window attention, while employing a high-frequency bridging branch to simulate shifted window operations, supplementing appropriate global and high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage Channel Allocation(PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention similarity without additional computational cost. Building upon all of them, we propose a series of Pseudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{Win}dow DiTs (\textbf{Swin DiT}), accompanied by extensive experiments demonstrating their superior performance. For example, our proposed Swin-DiT-L achieves a 54%$\uparrow$ FID improvement over DiT-XL/2 while requiring less computational. https://github.com/wujiafu007/Swin-DiT</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic Information-based Hierarchical Speech Enhancement Method Using Factorized Codec and Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13843v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most current speech enhancement (SE) methods recover clean speech from noisy inputs by directly estimating time-frequency masks or spectrums. However, these approaches often neglect the distinct attributes, such as semantic content and acoustic details, inherent in speech signals, which can hinder performance in downstream tasks. Moreover, their effectiveness tends to degrade in complex acoustic environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel, semantic information-based, step-by-step factorized SE method using factorized codec and diffusion model. Unlike traditional SE methods, our hierarchical modeling of semantic and acoustic attributes enables more robust clean speech recovery, particularly in challenging acoustic scenarios. Moreover, this method offers further advantages for downstream TTS tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm not only outperforms SOTA baselines in terms of speech quality but also enhances TTS performance in noisy environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by interspeech 2025</p></details> |

Nonetheless, existing methods often produce outliers that are considerably distant from the ID, showing limited efficacy for capturing subtle distinctions between ID and OOD. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Semantic Outlier generation via Nuisance Awareness (SONA), which notably produces challenging outliers by directly leveraging pixel-space ID samples through diffusion models. Our approach incorporates SONA guidance, providing separate control over semantic and nuisance regions of ID samples. Thereby, the generated outliers achieve two crucial properties: (i) they present explicit semantic-discrepant information, while (ii) maintaining various levels of nuisance resemblance with ID. Furthermore, the improved OOD detector training with SONA outliers facilitates learning with a focus on semantic distinctions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving an impressive AUROC of 88% on near-OOD datasets, which surpasses the performance of baseline methods by a significant margin of approximately 6%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Compositional Generation with Diffusion Models Using Lift Scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13740v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel resampling criterion using lift scores, for improving compositional generation in diffusion models. By leveraging the lift scores, we evaluate whether generated samples align with each single condition and then compose the results to determine whether the composed prompt is satisfied. Our key insight is that lift scores can be efficiently approximated using only the original diffusion model, requiring no additional training or external modules. We develop an optimized variant that achieves relatively lower computational overhead during inference while maintaining effectiveness. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that lift scores significantly improved the condition alignment for compositional generation across 2D synthetic data, CLEVR position tasks, and text-to-image synthesis. Our code is available at http://github.com/rainorangelemon/complift.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Long-Context Diffusion Policies via Past-Token Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09561v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning over long sequences of observations and actions is essential for many robotic tasks. Yet, learning effective long-context policies from demonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training becomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy performance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods typically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding historical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the retention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in imitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion policies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture essential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we introduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy learns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization significantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal reliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further introduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with short contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context embeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing memory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a self-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and select candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments across four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and accelerates policy training by more than 10x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Videos are available at https://long-context-dp.github.io</p></details> |
| **[On the Vulnerability of Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17537v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of text-to-image diffusion models has raised significant privacy and security concerns, particularly regarding the generation of copyrighted or harmful images. In response, several concept erasure (defense) methods have been developed to prevent the generation of unwanted content through post-hoc finetuning. On the other hand, concept restoration (attack) methods seek to recover supposedly erased concepts via adversarially crafted prompts. However, all existing restoration methods only succeed in the highly restrictive scenario of finding adversarial prompts tailed to some fixed seed. To address this, we introduce RECORD, a novel coordinate-descent-based restoration algorithm that finds adversarial prompts to recover erased concepts independently of the seed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate RECORD consistently outperforms the current restoration methods by up to 17.8 times in this setting. Our findings further reveal the susceptibility of unlearned models to restoration attacks, providing crucial insights into the behavior of unlearned models under the influence of adversarial prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Restoration Score Distillation: From Corrupted Diffusion Pretraining to One-Step High-Quality Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13377v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning generative models from corrupted data is a fundamental yet persistently challenging task across scientific disciplines, particularly when access to clean data is limited or expensive. Denoising Score Distillation (DSD) \cite{chen2025denoising} recently introduced a novel and surprisingly effective strategy that leverages score distillation to train high-fidelity generative models directly from noisy observations. Building upon this foundation, we propose \textit{Restoration Score Distillation} (RSD), a principled generalization of DSD that accommodates a broader range of corruption types, such as blurred, incomplete, or low-resolution images. RSD operates by first pretraining a teacher diffusion model solely on corrupted data and subsequently distilling it into a single-step generator that produces high-quality reconstructions. Empirically, RSD consistently surpasses its teacher model across diverse restoration tasks on both natural and scientific datasets. Moreover, beyond standard diffusion objectives, the RSD framework is compatible with several corruption-aware training techniques such as Ambient Tweedie, Ambient Diffusion, and its Fourier-space variant, enabling flexible integration with recent advances in diffusion modeling. Theoretically, we demonstrate that in a linear regime, RSD recovers the eigenspace of the clean data covariance matrix from linear measurements, thereby serving as an implicit regularizer. This interpretation recasts score distillation not only as a sampling acceleration technique but as a principled approach to enhancing generative performance in severely degraded data regimes.</p></details> |  |

We first extract dense optical flow from a reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://berkegokmen1.github.io/RoPECraft/</p></details> |

However, existing techniques mainly focus on high-fidelity reconstruction, requiring many bits for compression. This paper proposes a "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model" (DDPM) architecture for point cloud compression (DDPM-PCC) at low bit-rates. A PointNet encoder produces the condition vector for the generation, which is then quantized via a learnable vector quantizer. This configuration allows to achieve a low bitrates while preserving quality. Experiments on ShapeNet and ModelNet40 show improved rate-distortion at low rates compared to standardized and state-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper, we propose Epistemic Mixture of Experts (EMoE), a novel framework for efficiently estimating epistemic uncertainty in diffusion models. EMoE leverages pre-trained networks without requiring additional training, enabling direct uncertainty estimation from a prompt. We leverage a latent space within the diffusion process that captures epistemic uncertainty better than existing methods. Experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate EMoE's effectiveness, showing a strong correlation between uncertainty and image quality. Additionally, EMoE identifies under-sampled languages and regions with higher uncertainty, revealing hidden biases in the training set. This capability demonstrates the relevance of EMoE as a tool for addressing fairness and accountability in AI-generated content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models with Double Guidance: Generate with aggregated datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13213v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating large-scale datasets for training high-performance generative models is often prohibitively expensive, especially when associated attributes or annotations must be provided. As a result, merging existing datasets has become a common strategy. However, the sets of attributes across datasets are often inconsistent, and their naive concatenation typically leads to block-wise missing conditions. This presents a significant challenge for conditional generative modeling when the multiple attributes are used jointly as conditions, thereby limiting the model's controllability and applicability. To address this issue, we propose a novel generative approach, Diffusion Model with Double Guidance, which enables precise conditional generation even when no training samples contain all conditions simultaneously. Our method maintains rigorous control over multiple conditions without requiring joint annotations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in molecular and image generation tasks, where it outperforms existing baselines both in alignment with target conditional distributions and in controllability under missing condition settings.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, we define the forward noising process using Dirichlet forms associated to the Cameron-Martin space of Gaussian measures and Wiener chaoses; whereas by relying on an abstract time-reversal formula, we show that the score function is a Malliavin derivative and it corresponds to a conditional expectation. This allows us to generalize SGMs to the infinite-dimensional setting. Moreover, we extend existing finite-dimensional entropic convergence bounds to this Hilbertian setting by highlighting the role played by the Cameron-Martin norm in the Fisher information of the data distribution. Lastly, we specify our discussion for spherical random fields, considering as source of noise a Whittle-Mat\'ern random spherical field.</p></details> | 22 pages |

In computer vision, this translates into a classification problem, where knowledge from seen categories is transferred to unseen categories by exploiting the relationships between visual features and available semantic information, such as text corpora or manual annotations. However, learning this joint distribution is costly and requires one-to-one training with corresponding semantic information. We present a reversed conditional Diffusion-based model (RevCD) that mitigates this issue by generating semantic features synthesized from visual inputs by leveraging Diffusion models' conditional mechanisms. Our RevCD model consists of a cross Hadamard-Addition embedding of a sinusoidal time schedule and a multi-headed visual transformer for attention-guided embeddings. The proposed approach introduces three key innovations. First, we reverse the process of generating semantic space based on visual data, introducing a novel loss function that facilitates more efficient knowledge transfer. Second, we apply Diffusion models to zero-shot learning - a novel approach that exploits their strengths in capturing data complexity. Third, we demonstrate our model's performance through a comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation.

| **[Higher fidelity perceptual image and video compression with a latent conditioned residual denoising diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13152v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion models achieved impressive results on several image generation tasks often outperforming GAN based models. Recently, the generative capabilities of diffusion models have been employed for perceptual image compression, such as in CDC. A major drawback of these diffusion-based methods is that, while producing impressive perceptual quality images they are dropping in fidelity/increasing the distortion to the original uncompressed images when compared with other traditional or learned image compression schemes aiming for fidelity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid compression scheme optimized for perceptual quality, extending the approach of the CDC model with a decoder network in order to reduce the impact on distortion metrics such as PSNR. After using the decoder network to generate an initial image, optimized for distortion, the latent conditioned diffusion model refines the reconstruction for perceptual quality by predicting the residual. On standard benchmarks, we achieve up to +2dB PSNR fidelity improvements while maintaining comparable LPIPS and FID perceptual scores when compared with CDC. Additionally, the approach is easily extensible to video compression, where we achieve similar results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AIM Workshop 2024 at ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Neurosymbolic Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13138v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors combine neural perception with symbolic reasoning to solve tasks like visual reasoning. However, standard NeSy predictors assume conditional independence between the symbols they extract, thus limiting their ability to model interactions and uncertainty - often leading to overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution generalisation. To overcome the limitations of the independence assumption, we introduce neurosymbolic diffusion models (NeSyDMs), a new class of NeSy predictors that use discrete diffusion to model dependencies between symbols. Our approach reuses the independence assumption from NeSy predictors at each step of the diffusion process, enabling scalable learning while capturing symbol dependencies and uncertainty quantification. Across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks - including high-dimensional visual path planning and rule-based autonomous driving - NeSyDMs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy among NeSy predictors and demonstrate strong calibration.</p></details> |  |

However, their lack of constraint-awareness limits their deployment in safety-critical applications. We propose Constraint-Aware Diffusion Guidance (CoDiG), a data-efficient and general-purpose framework that integrates barrier functions into the denoising process, guiding diffusion sampling toward constraint-satisfying outputs. CoDiG enables constraint satisfaction even with limited training data and generalizes across tasks. We evaluate our framework in the challenging setting of miniature autonomous racing, where real-time obstacle avoidance is essential. Real-world experiments show that CoDiG generates safe outputs efficiently under dynamic conditions, highlighting its potential for broader robotic applications.

Current 3D diffusion models focus on reconstructing target shape from images or a set of partial observations. While excelling in global context understanding, they struggle to capture the local details of complex shapes and limited to the occlusion and lighting conditions. To overcome these limitations, we utilize tactile images to capture the local 3D information and propose a Touch2Shape model, which leverages a touch-conditioned diffusion model to explore and reconstruct the target shape from touch. For shape reconstruction, we have developed a touch embedding module to condition the diffusion model in creating a compact representation and a touch shape fusion module to refine the reconstructed shape. For shape exploration, we combine the diffusion model with reinforcement learning to train a policy. This involves using the generated latent vector from the diffusion model to guide the touch exploration policy training through a novel reward design. Experiments validate the reconstruction quality thorough both qualitatively and quantitative analysis, and our touch exploration policy further boosts reconstruction performance.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[DPBridge: Latent Diffusion Bridge for Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20506v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in capturing complex data distributions and have achieved compelling results in many generative tasks. While they have recently been extended to dense prediction tasks such as depth estimation and surface normal prediction, their full potential in this area remains under-explored. In dense prediction settings, target signal maps and input images are pixel-wise aligned. This makes conventional noise-to-data generation paradigm inefficient, as input images can serve as more informative prior compared to pure noise. Diffusion bridge models, which support data-to-data generation between two general data distributions, offer a promising alternative, but they typically fail to exploit the rich visual priors embedded in large pretrained foundation models. To address these limitations, we integrate diffusion bridge formulation with structured visual priors and introduce DPBridge, the first latent diffusion bridge framework for dense prediction tasks. Our method presents three key contributions: (1) a tractable reverse transition kernel for diffusion bridge process, enabling maximum likelihood training scheme for better compatibility with pretrained backbones; (2) a distribution-aligned normalization technique to mitigate the discrepancies between the bridge and standard diffusion processes; and (3) an auxiliary image consistency loss to preserve fine-grained details. Experiments across extensive benchmarks validate that our method consistently achieves superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capability under different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, most proactive defense methods only can safeguard images against manipulation under known conditions, and fail to protect images from manipulations guided by tampering conditions crafted by malicious users. To tackle this issue, we propose Anti-Inpainting, a proactive defense method that achieves adequate protection under unknown conditions through a triple mechanism to address this challenge. Specifically, a multi-level deep feature extractor is presented to obtain intricate features during the diffusion denoising process to improve protective effectiveness. We design multi-scale semantic-preserving data augmentation to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations across unknown conditions by multi-scale transformations while preserving semantic integrity. In addition, we propose a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy to improve the protection of adversarial perturbation against manipulation under diverse random seeds. Extensive experiments indicate the proactive defensive performance of Anti-Inpainting against diffusion-based inpainters guided by unknown conditions in InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ. At the same time, we also demonstrate the proposed approach's robustness under various image purification methods and its transferability across different versions of diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Conventional methods often optimize only the diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) without considering their relationship with the non-diffusion-weighted (b=0) reference images. However, calculating diffusion metrics, such as the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and diffusion tensor with its derived metrics like fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), relies on the ratio between each DWI and the b=0 image, which is crucial for clinical observation and diagnostics. In this study, we demonstrate that solely enhancing DWIs using a conventional pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss is insufficient, as the error in ratio between generated DWIs and b=0 diverges. We propose a novel ratio loss, defined as the MSE loss between the predicted and ground-truth log of DWI/b=0 ratios. Our results show that incorporating the ratio loss significantly improves the convergence of this ratio error, achieving lower ratio MSE and slightly enhancing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of generated DWIs. This leads to improved dMRI super-resolution and better preservation of b=0 ratio-based features for the derivation of diffusion metrics.</p></details> | IEEE ISBI 2025 |

Additionally, prior approaches yield divergent time scores near boundaries, leading to instability. We design $\textbf{D}^3\textbf{RE}$, a unified framework for robust, stable and efficient density ratio estimation. We propose the dequantified diffusion bridge interpolant (DDBI), which expands support coverage and stabilizes time scores via diffusion bridges and Gaussian dequantization. Building on DDBI, the proposed dequantified Schr{\"o}dinger bridge interpolant (DSBI) incorporates optimal transport to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method offers uniform approximation and bounded time scores in theory, and outperforms baselines empirically in mutual information and density estimation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LatentINDIGO: An INN-Guided Latent Diffusion Algorithm for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12935v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in the use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) for image restoration (IR) tasks due to their ability to model effectively the distribution of natural images. While significant progress has been made, there are still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches depend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex or unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second, many methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and finally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain for guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations through a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse transform. We further integrate this design into a latent diffusion pipeline through two proposed approaches: LatentINDIGO-PixelINN, which operates in the pixel domain, and LatentINDIGO-LatentINN, which stays fully in the latent space to reduce complexity. Both approaches alternate between updating intermediate latent variables under the guidance of our INN and refining the INN forward model to handle unknown degradations. In addition, a regularization step preserves the proximity of latent variables to the natural image manifold. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world low-quality images, and can be readily adapted to arbitrary output sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |
