| **["See What I Imagine, Imagine What I See": Human-AI Co-Creation System for 360$^\circ$ Panoramic Video Generation in VR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15456v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging field of panoramic video generation from text and image prompts unlocks new creative possibilities in virtual reality (VR), addressing the limitations of current immersive experiences, which are constrained by pre-designed environments that restrict user creativity. To advance this frontier, we present Imagine360, a proof-of-concept prototype that integrates co-creation principles with AI agents. This system enables refined speech-based text prompts, egocentric perspective adjustments, and real-time customization of virtual surroundings based on user perception and intent. An eight-participant pilot study comparing non-AI and linear AI-driven workflows demonstrates that Imagine360's co-creative approach effectively integrates temporal and spatial creative controls. This introduces a transformative VR paradigm, allowing users to seamlessly transition between 'seeing' and 'imagining,' thereby shaping virtual reality through the creations of their minds.</p></details> |  |

Through a series of perceptual studies, we report on the realism of AI-generated voices in terms of identity matching and naturalness. We find human participants cannot consistently identify recordings of AI-generated voices. Specifically, participants perceived the identity of an AI-voice to be the same as its real counterpart approximately 80% of the time, and correctly identified a voice as AI generated only about 60% of the time.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoShield: Regulating Diffusion-based Video Generation Models via Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14195v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has advanced significantly, particularly with the development of video generation models such as text-to-video (T2V) models and image-to-video (I2V) models. However, like other AIGC types, video generation requires robust content control. A common approach is to embed watermarks, but most research has focused on images, with limited attention given to videos. Traditional methods, which embed watermarks frame-by-frame in a post-processing manner, often degrade video quality. In this paper, we propose VideoShield, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for popular diffusion-based video generation models. Unlike post-processing methods, VideoShield embeds watermarks directly during video generation, eliminating the need for additional training. To ensure video integrity, we introduce a tamper localization feature that can detect changes both temporally (across frames) and spatially (within individual frames). Our method maps watermark bits to template bits, which are then used to generate watermarked noise during the denoising process. Using DDIM Inversion, we can reverse the video to its original watermarked noise, enabling straightforward watermark extraction. Additionally, template bits allow precise detection for potential temporal and spatial modification. Extensive experiments across various video models (both T2V and I2V models) demonstrate that our method effectively extracts watermarks and detects tamper without compromising video quality. Furthermore, we show that this approach is applicable to image generation models, enabling tamper detection in generated images as well.

| **[Improving Video Generation with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13918v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has achieved significant advances through rectified flow techniques, but issues like unsmooth motion and misalignment between videos and prompts persist. In this work, we develop a systematic pipeline that harnesses human feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation model. Specifically, we begin by constructing a large-scale human preference dataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise annotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, a multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models by extending those from diffusion models. These include two training-time strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom weights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video quality needs.

| **[EchoVideo: Identity-Preserving Human Video Generation by Multimodal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13452v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have significantly impacted various downstream applications, particularly in identity-preserving video generation (IPT2V). However, existing methods struggle with "copy-paste" artifacts and low similarity issues, primarily due to their reliance on low-level facial image information. This dependence can result in rigid facial appearances and artifacts reflecting irrelevant details. To address these challenges, we propose EchoVideo, which employs two key strategies: (1) an Identity Image-Text Fusion Module (IITF) that integrates high-level semantic features from text, capturing clean facial identity representations while discarding occlusions, poses, and lighting variations to avoid the introduction of artifacts; (2) a two-stage training strategy, incorporating a stochastic method in the second phase to randomly utilize shallow facial information. The objective is to balance the enhancements in fidelity provided by shallow features while mitigating excessive reliance on them. This strategy encourages the model to utilize high-level features during training, ultimately fostering a more robust representation of facial identities. EchoVideo effectively preserves facial identities and maintains full-body integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves excellent results in generating high-quality, controllability and fidelity videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Depth Anything: Consistent Depth Estimation for Super-Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12375v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth Anything has achieved remarkable success in monocular depth estimation with strong generalization ability. However, it suffers from temporal inconsistency in videos, hindering its practical applications. Various methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue by leveraging video generation models or introducing priors from optical flow and camera poses. Nonetheless, these methods are only applicable to short videos (< 10 seconds) and require a trade-off between quality and computational efficiency. We propose Video Depth Anything for high-quality, consistent depth estimation in super-long videos (over several minutes) without sacrificing efficiency. We base our model on Depth Anything V2 and replace its head with an efficient spatial-temporal head. We design a straightforward yet effective temporal consistency loss by constraining the temporal depth gradient, eliminating the need for additional geometric priors. The model is trained on a joint dataset of video depth and unlabeled images, similar to Depth Anything V2. Moreover, a novel key-frame-based strategy is developed for long video inference. Experiments show that our model can be applied to arbitrarily long videos without compromising quality, consistency, or generalization ability. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video depth estimation. We offer models of different scales to support a range of scenarios, with our smallest model capable of real-time performance at 30 FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://videodepthanything.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Taming Teacher Forcing for Masked Autoregressive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12389v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MAGI, a hybrid video generation framework that combines masked modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame generation. Our key innovation, Complete Teacher Forcing (CTF), conditions masked frames on complete observation frames rather than masked ones (namely Masked Teacher Forcing, MTF), enabling a smooth transition from token-level (patch-level) to frame-level autoregressive generation. CTF significantly outperforms MTF, achieving a +23% improvement in FVD scores on first-frame conditioned video prediction. To address issues like exposure bias, we employ targeted training strategies, setting a new benchmark in autoregressive video generation. Experiments show that MAGI can generate long, coherent video sequences exceeding 100 frames, even when trained on as few as 16 frames, highlighting its potential for scalable, high-quality video generation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[TransPixeler: Advancing Text-to-Video Generation with Transparency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03006v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides, enabling diverse applications in entertainment, advertising, and education. However, generating RGBA video, which includes alpha channels for transparency, remains a challenge due to limited datasets and the difficulty of adapting existing models. Alpha channels are crucial for visual effects (VFX), allowing transparent elements like smoke and reflections to blend seamlessly into scenes. We introduce TransPixeler, a method to extend pretrained video models for RGBA generation while retaining the original RGB capabilities. TransPixar leverages a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, incorporating alpha-specific tokens and using LoRA-based fine-tuning to jointly generate RGB and alpha channels with high consistency. By optimizing attention mechanisms, TransPixar preserves the strengths of the original RGB model and achieves strong alignment between RGB and alpha channels despite limited training data. Our approach effectively generates diverse and consistent RGBA videos, advancing the possibilities for VFX and interactive content creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wileewang.github.io/TransPixar/</p></details> |
| **[GenVidBench: A Challenging Benchmark for Detecting AI-Generated Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11340v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of video generation models has made it increasingly challenging to distinguish AI-generated videos from real ones. This issue underscores the urgent need for effective AI-generated video detectors to prevent the dissemination of false information through such videos. However, the development of high-performance generative video detectors is currently impeded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets specifically designed for generative video detection. To this end, we introduce GenVidBench, a challenging AI-generated video detection dataset with several key advantages: 1) Cross Source and Cross Generator: The cross-generation source mitigates the interference of video content on the detection. The cross-generator ensures diversity in video attributes between the training and test sets, preventing them from being overly similar. 2) State-of-the-Art Video Generators: The dataset includes videos from 8 state-of-the-art AI video generators, ensuring that it covers the latest advancements in the field of video generation. 3) Rich Semantics: The videos in GenVidBench are analyzed from multiple dimensions and classified into various semantic categories based on their content. This classification ensures that the dataset is not only large but also diverse, aiding in the development of more generalized and effective detection models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different advanced video generators and present a challenging setting. Additionally, we present rich experimental results including advanced video classification models as baselines. With the GenVidBench, researchers can efficiently develop and evaluate AI-generated video detection models. Datasets and code are available at https://genvidbench.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[CatV2TON: Taming Diffusion Transformers for Vision-Based Virtual Try-On with Temporal Concatenation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11325v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on (VTON) technology has gained attention due to its potential to transform online retail by enabling realistic clothing visualization of images and videos. However, most existing methods struggle to achieve high-quality results across image and video try-on tasks, especially in long video scenarios. In this work, we introduce CatV2TON, a simple and effective vision-based virtual try-on (V2TON) method that supports both image and video try-on tasks with a single diffusion transformer model. By temporally concatenating garment and person inputs and training on a mix of image and video datasets, CatV2TON achieves robust try-on performance across static and dynamic settings. For efficient long-video generation, we propose an overlapping clip-based inference strategy that uses sequential frame guidance and Adaptive Clip Normalization (AdaCN) to maintain temporal consistency with reduced resource demands. We also present ViViD-S, a refined video try-on dataset, achieved by filtering back-facing frames and applying 3D mask smoothing for enhanced temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CatV2TON outperforms existing methods in both image and video try-on tasks, offering a versatile and reliable solution for realistic virtual try-ons across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[UniMLVG: Unified Framework for Multi-view Long Video Generation with Comprehensive Control Capabilities for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04842v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The creation of diverse and realistic driving scenarios has become essential to enhance perception and planning capabilities of the autonomous driving system. However, generating long-duration, surround-view consistent driving videos remains a significant challenge. To address this, we present UniMLVG, a unified framework designed to generate extended street multi-perspective videos under precise control. By integrating single- and multi-view driving videos into the training data, our approach updates cross-frame and cross-view modules across three stages with different training objectives, substantially boosting the diversity and quality of generated visual content. Additionally, we employ the explicit viewpoint modeling in multi-view video generation to effectively improve motion transition consistency. Capable of handling various input reference formats (e.g., text, images, or video), our UniMLVG generates high-quality multi-view videos according to the corresponding condition constraints such as 3D bounding boxes or frame-level text descriptions. Compared to the best models with similar capabilities, our framework achieves improvements of 21.4% in FID and 36.5% in FVD.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMO2: End-Effector Guided Audio-Driven Avatar Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10687v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel audio-driven talking head method capable of simultaneously generating highly expressive facial expressions and hand gestures. Unlike existing methods that focus on generating full-body or half-body poses, we investigate the challenges of co-speech gesture generation and identify the weak correspondence between audio features and full-body gestures as a key limitation. To address this, we redefine the task as a two-stage process. In the first stage, we generate hand poses directly from audio input, leveraging the strong correlation between audio signals and hand movements. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion model to synthesize video frames, incorporating the hand poses generated in the first stage to produce realistic facial expressions and body movements. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, such as CyberHost and Vlogger, in terms of both visual quality and synchronization accuracy. This work provides a new perspective on audio-driven gesture generation and a robust framework for creating expressive and natural talking head animations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LayerAnimate: Layer-specific Control for Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08295v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animated video separates foreground and background elements into layers, with distinct processes for sketching, refining, coloring, and in-betweening. Existing video generation methods typically treat animation as a monolithic data domain, lacking fine-grained control over individual layers. In this paper, we introduce LayerAnimate, a novel architectural approach that enhances fine-grained control over individual animation layers within a video diffusion model, allowing users to independently manipulate foreground and background elements in distinct layers. To address the challenge of limited layer-specific data, we propose a data curation pipeline that features automated element segmentation, motion-state hierarchical merging, and motion coherence refinement. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, and user study, we demonstrate that LayerAnimate outperforms current methods in terms of animation quality, control precision, and usability, making it an ideal tool for both professional animators and amateur enthusiasts. This framework opens up new possibilities for layer-specific animation applications and creative flexibility.

| **[HunyuanVideo: A Systematic Framework For Large Video Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03603v4)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have significantly impacted daily life for both individuals and industries. However, the leading video generation models remain closed-source, resulting in a notable performance gap between industry capabilities and those available to the public. In this report, we introduce HunyuanVideo, an innovative open-source video foundation model that demonstrates performance in video generation comparable to, or even surpassing, that of leading closed-source models. HunyuanVideo encompasses a comprehensive framework that integrates several key elements, including data curation, advanced architectural design, progressive model scaling and training, and an efficient infrastructure tailored for large-scale model training and inference. As a result, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13 billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. We conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to ensure high visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced filming techniques. According to evaluations by professionals, HunyuanVideo outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6, and three top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code for the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source communities. This initiative will empower individuals within the community to experiment with their ideas, fostering a more dynamic and vibrant video generation ecosystem. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffuEraser: A Diffusion Model for Video Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10018v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video inpainting algorithms integrate flow-based pixel propagation with transformer-based generation to leverage optical flow for restoring textures and objects using information from neighboring frames, while completing masked regions through visual Transformers. However, these approaches often encounter blurring and temporal inconsistencies when dealing with large masks, highlighting the need for models with enhanced generative capabilities. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a prominent technique in image and video generation due to their impressive performance. In this paper, we introduce DiffuEraser, a video inpainting model based on stable diffusion, designed to fill masked regions with greater details and more coherent structures. We incorporate prior information to provide initialization and weak conditioning,which helps mitigate noisy artifacts and suppress hallucinations. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency during long-sequence inference, we expand the temporal receptive fields of both the prior model and DiffuEraser, and further enhance consistency by leveraging the temporal smoothing property of Video Diffusion Models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both content completeness and temporal consistency while maintaining acceptable efficiency.</p></details> | 11pages, 13figures |
| **[RichSpace: Enriching Text-to-Video Prompt Space via Text Embedding Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09982v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generation models have made impressive progress, but they still struggle with generating videos with complex features. This limitation often arises from the inability of the text encoder to produce accurate embeddings, which hinders the video generation model. In this work, we propose a novel approach to overcome this challenge by selecting the optimal text embedding through interpolation in the embedding space. We demonstrate that this method enables the video generation model to produce the desired videos. Additionally, we introduce a simple algorithm using perpendicular foot embeddings and cosine similarity to identify the optimal interpolation embedding. Our findings highlight the importance of accurate text embeddings and offer a pathway for improving text-to-video generation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoWorld: Exploring Knowledge Learning from Unlabeled Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09781v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work explores whether a deep generative model can learn complex knowledge solely from visual input, in contrast to the prevalent focus on text-based models like large language models (LLMs). We develop VideoWorld, an auto-regressive video generation model trained on unlabeled video data, and test its knowledge acquisition abilities in video-based Go and robotic control tasks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) video-only training provides sufficient information for learning knowledge, including rules, reasoning and planning capabilities, and (2) the representation of visual change is crucial for knowledge acquisition. To improve both the efficiency and efficacy of this process, we introduce the Latent Dynamics Model (LDM) as a key component of VideoWorld. Remarkably, VideoWorld reaches a 5-dan professional level in the Video-GoBench with just a 300-million-parameter model, without relying on search algorithms or reward mechanisms typical in reinforcement learning. In robotic tasks, VideoWorld effectively learns diverse control operations and generalizes across environments, approaching the performance of oracle models in CALVIN and RLBench. This study opens new avenues for knowledge acquisition from visual data, with all code, data, and models open-sourced for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are released at: https://maverickren.github.io/VideoWorld.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Learnings from Scaling Visual Tokenizers for Reconstruction and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09755v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual tokenization via auto-encoding empowers state-of-the-art image and video generative models by compressing pixels into a latent space. Although scaling Transformer-based generators has been central to recent advances, the tokenizer component itself is rarely scaled, leaving open questions about how auto-encoder design choices influence both its objective of reconstruction and downstream generative performance. Our work aims to conduct an exploration of scaling in auto-encoders to fill in this blank. To facilitate this exploration, we replace the typical convolutional backbone with an enhanced Vision Transformer architecture for Tokenization (ViTok). We train ViTok on large-scale image and video datasets far exceeding ImageNet-1K, removing data constraints on tokenizer scaling. We first study how scaling the auto-encoder bottleneck affects both reconstruction and generation -- and find that while it is highly correlated with reconstruction, its relationship with generation is more complex. We next explored the effect of separately scaling the auto-encoders' encoder and decoder on reconstruction and generation performance. Crucially, we find that scaling the encoder yields minimal gains for either reconstruction or generation, while scaling the decoder boosts reconstruction but the benefits for generation are mixed. Building on our exploration, we design ViTok as a lightweight auto-encoder that achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art auto-encoders on ImageNet-1K and COCO reconstruction tasks (256p and 512p) while outperforming existing auto-encoders on 16-frame 128p video reconstruction for UCF-101, all with 2-5x fewer FLOPs. When integrated with Diffusion Transformers, ViTok demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks for class-conditional video generation on UCF-101.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 25 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Ouroboros-Diffusion: Exploring Consistent Content Generation in Tuning-free Long Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09019v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The first-in-first-out (FIFO) video diffusion, built on a pre-trained text-to-video model, has recently emerged as an effective approach for tuning-free long video generation. This technique maintains a queue of video frames with progressively increasing noise, continuously producing clean frames at the queue's head while Gaussian noise is enqueued at the tail. However, FIFO-Diffusion often struggles to keep long-range temporal consistency in the generated videos due to the lack of correspondence modeling across frames. In this paper, we propose Ouroboros-Diffusion, a novel video denoising framework designed to enhance structural and content (subject) consistency, enabling the generation of consistent videos of arbitrary length. Specifically, we introduce a new latent sampling technique at the queue tail to improve structural consistency, ensuring perceptually smooth transitions among frames. To enhance subject consistency, we devise a Subject-Aware Cross-Frame Attention (SACFA) mechanism, which aligns subjects across frames within short segments to achieve better visual coherence. Furthermore, we introduce self-recurrent guidance. This technique leverages information from all previous cleaner frames at the front of the queue to guide the denoising of noisier frames at the end, fostering rich and contextual global information interaction. Extensive experiments of long video generation on the VBench benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our Ouroboros-Diffusion, particularly in terms of subject consistency, motion smoothness, and temporal consistency.</p></details> |  |

Previous text-to-video benchmarks also neglect this important ability for evaluation. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on compositional text-to-video generation. We propose T2V-CompBench, the first benchmark tailored for compositional text-to-video generation. T2V-CompBench encompasses diverse aspects of compositionality, including consistent attribute binding, dynamic attribute binding, spatial relationships, motion binding, action binding, object interactions, and generative numeracy. We further carefully design evaluation metrics of multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based, detection-based, and tracking-based metrics, which can better reflect the compositional text-to-video generation quality of seven proposed categories with 1400 text prompts. The effectiveness of the proposed metrics is verified by correlation with human evaluations. We also benchmark various text-to-video generative models and conduct in-depth analysis across different models and various compositional categories. We find that compositional text-to-video generation is highly challenging for current models, and we hope our attempt could shed light on future research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://t2v-compbench-2025.github.io/ Code: https://github.com/KaiyueSun98/T2V-CompBench/tree/V2</p></details> |
| **[RepVideo: Rethinking Cross-Layer Representation for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08994v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has achieved remarkable progress with the introduction of diffusion models, which have significantly improved the quality of generated videos. However, recent research has primarily focused on scaling up model training, while offering limited insights into the direct impact of representations on the video generation process. In this paper, we initially investigate the characteristics of features in intermediate layers, finding substantial variations in attention maps across different layers. These variations lead to unstable semantic representations and contribute to cumulative differences between features, which ultimately reduce the similarity between adjacent frames and negatively affect temporal coherence. To address this, we propose RepVideo, an enhanced representation framework for text-to-video diffusion models. By accumulating features from neighboring layers to form enriched representations, this approach captures more stable semantic information. These enhanced representations are then used as inputs to the attention mechanism, thereby improving semantic expressiveness while ensuring feature consistency across adjacent frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RepVideo not only significantly enhances the ability to generate accurate spatial appearances, such as capturing complex spatial relationships between multiple objects, but also improves temporal consistency in video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vchitect.github.io/RepVid-Webpage</p></details> |
| **[Comprehensive Subjective and Objective Evaluation Method for Text-generated Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08545v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-video (T2V) technology advancements, as demonstrated by models such as Gen3, Pika, and Sora, have significantly broadened its applicability and popularity. This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of text-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-generated videos remains challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed a large-scale benchmark dataset for \textbf{T}ext-generated \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{eval}uation, \textbf{T2VEval-Bench}, comprising 148 textual words and 1,783 videos generated by 12 models. During the subjective evaluation, we collected five key scores: overall impression, video quality, aesthetic quality, realness, and text-video consistency. For objective evaluation, we developed the \textbf{T2VEval} model, which assesses videos across three branches: quality, authenticity, and consistency. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large oracle model. Additionally, we implemented a progressive training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. The dataset and code will be open-sourced upon completion of the follow-up work.</p></details> |  |

| **[Do generative video models learn physical principles from watching videos?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09038v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI video generation is undergoing a revolution, with quality and realism advancing rapidly. These advances have led to a passionate scientific debate: Do video models learn ``world models'' that discover laws of physics -- or, alternatively, are they merely sophisticated pixel predictors that achieve visual realism without understanding the physical principles of reality? We address this question by developing Physics-IQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that can only be solved by acquiring a deep understanding of various physical principles, like fluid dynamics, optics, solid mechanics, magnetism and thermodynamics. We find that across a range of current models (Sora, Runway, Pika, Lumiere, Stable Video Diffusion, and VideoPoet), physical understanding is severely limited, and unrelated to visual realism. At the same time, some test cases can already be successfully solved. This indicates that acquiring certain physical principles from observation alone may be possible, but significant challenges remain. While we expect rapid advances ahead, our work demonstrates that visual realism does not imply physical understanding.

| **[GameFactory: Creating New Games with Generative Interactive Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08325v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative game engines have the potential to revolutionize game development by autonomously creating new content and reducing manual workload. However, existing video-based game generation methods fail to address the critical challenge of scene generalization, limiting their applicability to existing games with fixed styles and scenes. In this paper, we present GameFactory, a framework focused on exploring scene generalization in game video generation. To enable the creation of entirely new and diverse games, we leverage pre-trained video diffusion models trained on open-domain video data. To bridge the domain gap between open-domain priors and small-scale game dataset, we propose a multi-phase training strategy that decouples game style learning from action control, preserving open-domain generalization while achieving action controllability. Using Minecraft as our data source, we release GF-Minecraft, a high-quality and diversity action-annotated video dataset for research. Furthermore, we extend our framework to enable autoregressive action-controllable game video generation, allowing the production of unlimited-length interactive game videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GameFactory effectively generates open-domain, diverse, and action-controllable game videos, representing a significant step forward in AI-driven game generation.

While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Gaussian Splatting with Normal Information for Mesh Extraction and Improved Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08370v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as an efficient and flexible rendering technique for representing complex scenes from a collection of 2D views and enabling high-quality real-time novel-view synthesis. However, its reliance on photometric losses can lead to imprecisely reconstructed geometry and extracted meshes, especially in regions with high curvature or fine detail. We propose a novel regularization method using the gradients of a signed distance function estimated from the Gaussians, to improve the quality of rendering while also extracting a surface mesh. The regularizing normal supervision facilitates better rendering and mesh reconstruction, which is crucial for downstream applications in video generation, animation, AR-VR and gaming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on datasets such as Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep-Blending. Our method scores higher on photorealism metrics compared to other mesh extracting rendering methods without compromising mesh quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025: Workshop on Generative Data Augmentation for Real-World Signal Processing Applications</p></details> |

Existing methods construct such supervision signals from videos, as they capture how objects change with various physical interactions. However, these models are usually built upon text-to-image diffusion models, so necessitate (i) massive training samples and (ii) an additional reference encoder to learn real-world dynamics and visual consistency. In this paper, we reformulate this task as an image-to-video generation problem, so that inherit powerful video diffusion priors to reduce training costs and ensure temporal consistency. Specifically, we introduce FramePainter as an efficient instantiation of this formulation. Initialized with Stable Video Diffusion, it only uses a lightweight sparse control encoder to inject editing signals. Considering the limitations of temporal attention in handling large motion between two frames, we further propose matching attention to enlarge the receptive field while encouraging dense correspondence between edited and source image tokens. We highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of FramePainter across various of editing signals: it domainantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with far less training data, achieving highly seamless and coherent editing of images, \eg, automatically adjust the reflection of the cup. Moreover, FramePainter also exhibits exceptional generalization in scenarios not present in real-world videos, \eg, transform the clownfish into shark-like shape.

In this work, we propose to decompose videos into visual primitives - blob video representation, a general representation for controllable video generation. Based on blob conditions, we develop a blob-grounded video diffusion model named BlobGEN-Vid that allows users to control object motions and fine-grained object appearance. In particular, we introduce a masked 3D attention module that effectively improves regional consistency across frames. In addition, we introduce a learnable module to interpolate text embeddings so that users can control semantics in specific frames and obtain smooth object transitions. We show that our framework is model-agnostic and build BlobGEN-Vid based on both U-Net and DiT-based video diffusion models. Extensive experimental results show that BlobGEN-Vid achieves superior zero-shot video generation ability and state-of-the-art layout controllability on multiple benchmarks. When combined with an LLM for layout planning, our framework even outperforms proprietary text-to-video generators in terms of compositional accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://blobgen-vid2.github.io/</p></details> |

While many existing methods depend on additional control modules or inference-time fine-tuning, recent studies suggest that effective motion guidance is achievable without altering the model architecture or requiring extra training. Such approaches offer promising compatibility with various video generation foundation models. However, existing training-free methods often struggle to maintain consistent temporal coherence across frames or to follow guided motion accurately. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that combines an initial-noise-based approach with a novel motion consistency loss, the latter being our key innovation. Specifically, we capture the inter-frame feature correlation patterns of intermediate features from a video diffusion model to represent the motion pattern of the reference video. We then design a motion consistency loss to maintain similar feature correlation patterns in the generated video, using the gradient of this loss in the latent space to guide the generation process for precise motion control. This approach improves temporal consistency across various motion control tasks while preserving the benefits of a training-free setup. Extensive experiments show that our method sets a new standard for efficient, temporally coherent video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zhangxinyu-xyz.github.io/SimulateMotion.github.io/</p></details> |

Specifically, we consider a design principle of ``animation for editing'', and train Qffusion as a general animation framework from two still reference images while we can use it for portrait video editing easily by applying modified start and end frames as references during inference. Leveraging the powerful generative power of Stable Diffusion, we propose a Quadrant-grid Arrangement (QGA) scheme for latent re-arrangement, which arranges the latent codes of two reference images and that of four facial conditions into a four-grid fashion, separately. Then, we fuse features of these two modalities and use self-attention for both appearance and temporal learning, where representations at different times are jointly modeled under QGA. Our Qffusion can achieve stable video editing without additional networks or complex training stages, where only the input format of Stable Diffusion is modified. Further, we propose a Quadrant-grid Propagation (QGP) inference strategy, which enjoys a unique advantage on stable arbitrary-length video generation by processing reference and condition frames recursively. Through extensive experiments, Qffusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on portrait video editing.</p></details> | 15 pages |

To meet the computational demands of AI tasks, current mobile SoCs are equipped with diverse AI accelerators, including GPUs and Neural Processing Units (NPUs). However, there has not been a comprehensive characterization of these heterogeneous processors, and existing designs typically only leverage a single AI accelerator for LLM inference, leading to suboptimal use of computational resources and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we first summarize key performance characteristics of mobile SoC, including heterogeneous processors, unified memory, synchronization, etc. Drawing on these observations, we propose different tensor partition strategies to fulfill the distinct requirements of the prefill and decoding phases. We further design a fast synchronization mechanism that leverages the unified memory address provided by mobile SoCs. By employing these techniques, we present HeteroLLM, the fastest LLM inference engine in mobile devices which supports both layer-level and tensor-level heterogeneous execution. Evaluation results show that HeteroLLM achieves 9.99 and 4.36 performance improvement over other mobile-side LLM inference engines: MLC and MNN.</p></details> |  |

Large-scale generative models for multi-view image generation are rapidly advancing the field of 3D inference from sparse observations. However, due to the nature of generative modeling, traditional reconstruction metrics are not suitable to measure the quality of generated outputs and metrics that are independent of the sampling procedure are desperately needed. In this work, we specifically address the aspect of consistency between generated multi-view images, which can be evaluated independently of the specific scene. Our approach uses DUSt3R to obtain dense 3D reconstructions from image pairs in a feed-forward manner, which are used to warp image contents from one view into the other. Then, feature maps of these images are compared to obtain a similarity score that is invariant to view-dependent effects. Using MEt3R, we evaluate the consistency of a large set of previous methods for novel view and video generation, including our open, multi-view latent diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://geometric-rl.mpi-inf.mpg.de/met3r/</p></details> |

However, existing methods often focus on limited domains, require time-consuming optimization per subject, or support only a single subject. We present Video Alchemist $-$ a video model with built-in multi-subject, open-set personalization capabilities for both foreground objects and background, eliminating the need for time-consuming test-time optimization. Our model is built on a new Diffusion Transformer module that fuses each conditional reference image and its corresponding subject-level text prompt with cross-attention layers. Developing such a large model presents two main challenges: dataset and evaluation. First, as paired datasets of reference images and videos are extremely hard to collect, we sample selected video frames as reference images and synthesize a clip of the target video. However, while models can easily denoise training videos given reference frames, they fail to generalize to new contexts. To mitigate this issue, we design a new automatic data construction pipeline with extensive image augmentations. Second, evaluating open-set video personalization is a challenge in itself. To address this, we introduce a personalization benchmark that focuses on accurate subject fidelity and supports diverse personalization scenarios. Finally, our extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing personalization methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/open-set-video-personalization/</p></details> |

For example, models such as CLIP, Claude, and GPT-4V demonstrate strong reasoning and understanding abilities on visual and textual data and beat classical single modality vision models on zero-shot classification. Despite their rapid advancements in research and growing popularity in applications, a comprehensive survey of existing studies on VLMs is notably lacking, particularly for researchers aiming to leverage VLMs in their specific domains. To this end, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs in the following aspects: model information of the major VLMs developed over the past five years (2019-2024); the main architectures and training methods of these VLMs; summary and categorization of the popular benchmarks and evaluation metrics of VLMs; the applications of VLMs including embodied agents, robotics, and video generation; the challenges and issues faced by current VLMs such as hallucination, fairness, and safety.

We uncover significant evidence of bias by analyzing the generated videos from a diverse set of gender-neutral and stereotypical prompts. The results indicate that Sora disproportionately associates specific genders with stereotypical behaviors and professions, which reflects societal prejudices embedded in its training data.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Progressive Growing of Video Tokenizers for Highly Compressed Latent Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05442v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video tokenizers are essential for latent video diffusion models, converting raw video data into spatiotemporally compressed latent spaces for efficient training. However, extending state-of-the-art video tokenizers to achieve a temporal compression ratio beyond 4x without increasing channel capacity poses significant challenges. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to enhance temporal compression. We find that the reconstruction quality of temporally subsampled videos from a low-compression encoder surpasses that of high-compression encoders applied to original videos. This indicates that high-compression models can leverage representations from lower-compression models. Building on this insight, we develop a bootstrapped high-temporal-compression model that progressively trains high-compression blocks atop well-trained lower-compression models. Our method includes a cross-level feature-mixing module to retain information from the pretrained low-compression model and guide higher-compression blocks to capture the remaining details from the full video sequence. Evaluation of video benchmarks shows that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality while increasing temporal compression compared to direct extensions of existing video tokenizers. Furthermore, the resulting compact latent space effectively trains a video diffusion model for high-quality video generation with a reduced token budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://progressive-video-tokenizer.github.io/Pro-MAG/</p></details> |

However, precise control over the video generation process, such as camera manipulation or content editing, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for controlled video generation are typically limited to a single control type, lacking the flexibility to handle diverse control demands. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple video control tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achieving versatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videos are fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as control inputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovation allows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the 3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their ability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800 GPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilities across diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control, motion transfer, and object manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://igl-hkust.github.io/das/ Codes: https://github.com/IGL-HKUST/DiffusionAsShader</p></details> |

However, Multi-Concept Video Customization (MCVC) remains a significant challenge. We identify two key challenges in this task: 1) the identity decoupling problem, where directly adopting existing customization methods inevitably mix attributes when handling multiple concepts simultaneously, and 2) the scarcity of high-quality video-entity pairs, which is crucial for training such a model that represents and decouples various concepts well. To address these challenges, we introduce ConceptMaster, an innovative framework that effectively tackles the critical issues of identity decoupling while maintaining concept fidelity in customized videos. Specifically, we introduce a novel strategy of learning decoupled multi-concept embeddings that are injected into the diffusion models in a standalone manner, which effectively guarantees the quality of customized videos with multiple identities, even for highly similar visual concepts. To further overcome the scarcity of high-quality MCVC data, we carefully establish a data construction pipeline, which enables systematic collection of precise multi-concept video-entity data across diverse concepts. A comprehensive benchmark is designed to validate the effectiveness of our model from three critical dimensions: concept fidelity, identity decoupling ability, and video generation quality across six different concept composition scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ConceptMaster significantly outperforms previous approaches for this task, paving the way for generating personalized and semantically accurate videos across multiple concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yuzhou914.github.io/ConceptMaster/</p></details> |

However, exerting control over the motion of objects in videos generated by any video diffusion model is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot moving object trajectory control framework, Motion-Zero, to enable a bounding-box-trajectories-controlled text-to-video diffusion model. To this end, an initial noise prior module is designed to provide a position-based prior to improve the stability of the appearance of the moving object and the accuracy of position. In addition, based on the attention map of the U-net, spatial constraints are directly applied to the denoising process of diffusion models, which further ensures the positional and spatial consistency of moving objects during the inference. Furthermore, temporal consistency is guaranteed with a proposed shift temporal attention mechanism. Our method can be flexibly applied to various state-of-the-art video diffusion models without any training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method can control the motion trajectories of objects and generate high-quality videos.

While recent video diffusion models have shown promising potential, they still grapple with spatiotemporal inconsistencies and high computational resource demands. We propose GLC-Diffusion, a tuning-free method for long video generation. It models the long video denoising process by establishing denoising trajectories through Global-Local Collaborative Denoising to ensure overall content consistency and temporal coherence between frames. Additionally, we introduce a Noise Reinitialization strategy which combines local noise shuffling with frequency fusion to improve global content consistency and visual diversity. Further, we propose a Video Motion Consistency Refinement (VMCR) module that computes the gradient of pixel-wise and frequency-wise losses to enhance visual consistency and temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments, including quantitative and qualitative evaluations on videos of varying lengths (\textit{e.g.}, 3\times and 6\times longer), demonstrate that our method effectively integrates with existing video diffusion models, producing coherent, high-fidelity long videos superior to previous approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, many studies have shown that these models often produce motion results lacking logical or physical coherence. In this paper, we revisit video generation models and find that single-stage approaches struggle to produce high-quality results while maintaining coherent motion reasoning. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{Motion Dreamer}, a two-stage video generation framework. In Stage I, the model generates an intermediate motion representation-such as a segmentation map or depth map-based on the input image and motion conditions, focusing solely on the motion itself. In Stage II, the model uses this intermediate motion representation as a condition to generate a high-detail video. By decoupling motion reasoning from high-fidelity video synthesis, our approach allows for more accurate and physically plausible motion generation. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the Physion dataset and in autonomous driving scenarios. For example, given a single push, our model can synthesize the sequential toppling of a set of dominoes. Similarly, by varying the movements of ego-cars, our model can produce different effects on other vehicles. Our work opens new avenues in creating models that can reason about physical interactions in a more coherent and realistic manner.

The advent of deep learning techniques and advancements in hardware capabilities have significantly enhanced the performance of lip reading models. Despite these advancements, existing datasets predominantly feature stable video recordings with limited variability in lip movements. This limitation results in models that are highly sensitive to variations encountered in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, LipGen, which aims to improve model robustness by leveraging speech-driven synthetic visual data, thereby mitigating the constraints of current datasets. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary task that incorporates viseme classification alongside attention mechanisms. This approach facilitates the efficient integration of temporal information, directing the model's focus toward the relevant segments of speech, thereby enhancing discriminative capabilities.

Traditional works lack the capability to generate complex large motions. While recent video generation techniques are powerful in creating high-quality results, they often lack fine control over the details of intermediate frames, which can lead to results that do not align with the creative mind. We introduce MotionBridge, a unified video inbetweening framework that allows flexible controls, including trajectory strokes, keyframes, masks, guide pixels, and text. However, learning such multi-modal controls in a unified framework is a challenging task. We thus design two generators to extract the control signal faithfully and encode feature through dual-branch embedders to resolve ambiguities. We further introduce a curriculum training strategy to smoothly learn various controls. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that such multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic, customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: [https://motionbridge.github.io/]</p></details> |

| **[Motion-Aware Generative Frame Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03699v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative frame interpolation, empowered by large-scale pre-trained video generation models, has demonstrated remarkable advantages in complex scenes. However, existing methods heavily rely on the generative model to independently infer the correspondences between input frames, an ability that is inadequately developed during pre-training. In this work, we propose a novel framework, termed Motion-aware Generative frame interpolation (MoG), to significantly enhance the model's motion awareness by integrating explicit motion guidance. Specifically we investigate two key questions: what can serve as an effective motion guidance, and how we can seamlessly embed this guidance into the generative model. For the first question, we reveal that the intermediate flow from flow-based interpolation models could efficiently provide task-oriented motion guidance. Regarding the second, we first obtain guidance-based representations of intermediate frames by warping input frames' representations using guidance, and then integrate them into the model at both latent and feature levels. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we train MoG on both real-world and animation datasets. Comprehensive evaluations show that our MoG significantly outperforms the existing methods in both domains, achieving superior video quality and improved fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoAnydoor: High-fidelity Video Object Insertion with Precise Motion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01427v3)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in video generation, inserting a given object into videos remains a challenging task. The difficulty lies in preserving the appearance details of the reference object and accurately modeling coherent motions at the same time. In this paper, we propose VideoAnydoor, a zero-shot video object insertion framework with high-fidelity detail preservation and precise motion control. Starting from a text-to-video model, we utilize an ID extractor to inject the global identity and leverage a box sequence to control the overall motion. To preserve the detailed appearance and meanwhile support fine-grained motion control, we design a pixel warper. It takes the reference image with arbitrary key-points and the corresponding key-point trajectories as inputs. It warps the pixel details according to the trajectories and fuses the warped features with the diffusion U-Net, thus improving detail preservation and supporting users in manipulating the motion trajectories. In addition, we propose a training strategy involving both videos and static images with a weighted loss to enhance insertion quality. VideoAnydoor demonstrates significant superiority over existing methods and naturally supports various downstream applications (e.g., talking head generation, video virtual try-on, multi-region editing) without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://videoanydoor.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[License Plate Images Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03374v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the evident practical importance of license plate recognition (LPR), corresponding research is limited by the volume of publicly available datasets due to privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To address this challenge, synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach. In this paper, we propose to synthesize realistic license plates (LPs) using diffusion models, inspired by recent advances in image and video generation. In our experiments a diffusion model was successfully trained on a Ukrainian LP dataset, and 1000 synthetic images were generated for detailed analysis. Through manual classification and annotation of the generated images, we performed a thorough study of the model output, such as success rate, character distributions, and type of failures. Our contributions include experimental validation of the efficacy of diffusion models for LP synthesis, along with insights into the characteristics of the generated data. Furthermore, we have prepared a synthetic dataset consisting of 10,000 LP images, publicly available at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13342102. Conducted experiments empirically confirm the usefulness of synthetic data for the LPR task. Despite the initial performance gap between the model trained with real and synthetic data, the expansion of the training data set with pseudolabeled synthetic data leads to an improvement in LPR accuracy by 3% compared to baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Through-The-Mask: Mask-based Motion Trajectories for Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03059v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the task of Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, which involves transforming static images into realistic video sequences based on a textual description. While recent advancements produce photorealistic outputs, they frequently struggle to create videos with accurate and consistent object motion, especially in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage compositional framework that decomposes I2V generation into: (i) An explicit intermediate representation generation stage, followed by (ii) A video generation stage that is conditioned on this representation. Our key innovation is the introduction of a mask-based motion trajectory as an intermediate representation, that captures both semantic object information and motion, enabling an expressive but compact representation of motion and semantics. To incorporate the learned representation in the second stage, we utilize object-level attention objectives. Specifically, we consider a spatial, per-object, masked-cross attention objective, integrating object-specific prompts into corresponding latent space regions and a masked spatio-temporal self-attention objective, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency for each object. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks with multi-object and high-motion scenarios and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in temporal coherence, motion realism, and text-prompt faithfulness. Additionally, we introduce \benchmark, a new challenging benchmark for single-object and multi-object I2V generation, and demonstrate our method's superiority on this benchmark.

However, training models for long video generation demands significant computational power and extensive data, leading most video diffusion models to be limited to a small number of frames. Existing training-free methods that attempt to generate long videos using pre-trained short video diffusion models often struggle with issues such as insufficient motion dynamics and degraded video fidelity. In this paper, we present Brick-Diffusion, a novel, training-free approach capable of generating long videos of arbitrary length. Our method introduces a brick-to-wall denoising strategy, where the latent is denoised in segments, with a stride applied in subsequent iterations. This process mimics the construction of a staggered brick wall, where each brick represents a denoised segment, enabling communication between frames and improving overall video quality. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that Brick-Diffusion outperforms existing baseline methods in generating high-fidelity videos.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |
| **[LVMark: Robust Watermark for latent video diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09122v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advancements in generative models have made it possible to create hyper-realistic videos. As their applicability increases, their unauthorized use has raised significant concerns, leading to the growing demand for techniques to protect the ownership of the generative model itself. While existing watermarking methods effectively embed watermarks into image-generative models, they fail to account for temporal information, resulting in poor performance when applied to video-generative models. To address this issue, we introduce a novel watermarking method called LVMark, which embeds watermarks into video diffusion models. A key component of LVMark is a selective weight modulation strategy that efficiently embeds watermark messages into the video diffusion model while preserving the quality of the generated videos. To accurately decode messages in the presence of malicious attacks, we design a watermark decoder that leverages spatio-temporal information in the 3D wavelet domain through a cross-attention module. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to highlight the potential of video-generative model watermarking as a valuable tool for enhancing the effectiveness of ownership protection in video-generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Slow Bidirectional to Fast Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07772v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner. We will release the code based on an open-source model in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://causvid.github.io/</p></details> |

Training a video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly to control 4D content requires expensive multi-view videos. Inspired by Monocular Dynamic novel View Synthesis (MDVS) that optimizes a 4D representation and renders videos according to different 4D elements, such as camera pose and object motion editing, we bring pseudo 4D Gaussian fields to video generation. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that constructs a pseudo 4D Gaussian field with dense 3D point tracking and renders the Gaussian field for all video frames. Then we finetune a pretrained DiT to generate videos following the guidance of the rendered video, dubbed as GS-DiT. To boost the training of the GS-DiT, we also propose an efficient Dense 3D Point Tracking (D3D-PT) method for the pseudo 4D Gaussian field construction. Our D3D-PT outperforms SpatialTracker, the state-of-the-art sparse 3D point tracking method, in accuracy and accelerates the inference speed by two orders of magnitude. During the inference stage, GS-DiT can generate videos with the same dynamic content while adhering to different camera parameters, addressing a significant limitation of current video generation models. GS-DiT demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and extends the 4D controllability of Gaussian splatting to video generation beyond just camera poses. It supports advanced cinematic effects through the manipulation of the Gaussian field and camera intrinsics, making it a powerful tool for creative video production.

This method offers users with a flexible and precise mechanism for manipulating video content. We also propose the TrackAdapter for control implementation, an efficient and lightweight adapter designed to be seamlessly integrated into the temporal self-attention layers of a pretrained video generation model. This design leverages our observation that the attention map of these layers can accurately activate regions corresponding to motion in videos. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new approach, enhanced by the TrackAdapter, achieves state-of-the-art performance on key metrics such as FVD, FID, and ObjMC scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce the first application of a pretrained transformer-based video generative model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and generates highly dynamic, realistic videos for portrait animation, effectively addressing these challenges. The adoption of a new video backbone model makes previous U-Net-based methods for identity maintenance, audio conditioning, and video extrapolation inapplicable. To address this limitation, we design an identity reference network consisting of a causal 3D VAE combined with a stacked series of transformer layers, ensuring consistent facial identity across video sequences. Additionally, we investigate various speech audio conditioning and motion frame mechanisms to enable the generation of continuous video driven by speech audio. Our method is validated through experiments on benchmark and newly proposed wild datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods in generating realistic portraits characterized by diverse orientations within dynamic and immersive scenes.

However, a significant lack of high-quality, human-centric video datasets presents a challenge to progress in this field. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenHumanVid, a large-scale and high-quality human-centric video dataset characterized by precise and detailed captions that encompass both human appearance and motion states, along with supplementary human motion conditions, including skeleton sequences and speech audio. To validate the efficacy of this dataset and the associated training strategies, we propose an extension of existing classical diffusion transformer architectures and conduct further pretraining of our models on the proposed dataset. Our findings yield two critical insights: First, the incorporation of a large-scale, high-quality dataset substantially enhances evaluation metrics for generated human videos while preserving performance in general video generation tasks. Second, the effective alignment of text with human appearance, human motion, and facial motion is essential for producing high-quality video outputs. Based on these insights and corresponding methodologies, the straightforward extended network trained on the proposed dataset demonstrates an obvious improvement in the generation of human-centric videos.

Reconstruction-based methods create 3D scenes from driving logs and synthesize geometry-consistent driving videos through neural rendering, but their dependence on costly object annotations limits their ability to generalize to in-the-wild driving scenarios. On the other hand, generative models can synthesize action-conditioned driving videos in a more generalizable way but often struggle with maintaining 3D visual consistency. In this paper, we present DreamDrive, a 4D spatial-temporal scene generation approach that combines the merits of generation and reconstruction, to synthesize generalizable 4D driving scenes and dynamic driving videos with 3D consistency. Specifically, we leverage the generative power of video diffusion models to synthesize a sequence of visual references and further elevate them to 4D with a novel hybrid Gaussian representation. Given a driving trajectory, we then render 3D-consistent driving videos via Gaussian splatting. The use of generative priors allows our method to produce high-quality 4D scenes from in-the-wild driving data, while neural rendering ensures 3D-consistent video generation from the 4D scenes. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and street view images demonstrate that DreamDrive can generate controllable and generalizable 4D driving scenes, synthesize novel views of driving videos with high fidelity and 3D consistency, decompose static and dynamic elements in a self-supervised manner, and enhance perception and planning tasks for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pointscoder.github.io/DreamDrive/</p></details> |

This paper introduces JoyGen, a novel two-stage framework for talking-face generation, comprising audio-driven lip motion generation and visual appearance synthesis. In the first stage, a 3D reconstruction model and an audio2motion model predict identity and expression coefficients respectively. Next, by integrating audio features with a facial depth map, we provide comprehensive supervision for precise lip-audio synchronization in facial generation. Additionally, we constructed a Chinese talking-face dataset containing 130 hours of high-quality video. JoyGen is trained on the open-source HDTF dataset and our curated dataset.

Due to the lack of datasets with comprehensive motion annotations, existing algorithms can not simultaneously control the motions of both camera and objects, resulting in limited controllability over generated contents. To address this issue and facilitate the research in this field, we introduce a Synthetic Dataset for Free-Form Motion Control (SynFMC). The proposed SynFMC dataset includes diverse objects and environments and covers various motion patterns according to specific rules, simulating common and complex real-world scenarios. The complete 6D pose information facilitates models learning to disentangle the motion effects from objects and the camera in a video. To validate the effectiveness and generalization of SynFMC, we further propose a method, Free-Form Motion Control (FMC). FMC enables independent or simultaneous control of object and camera movements, producing high-fidelity videos. Moreover, it is compatible with various personalized text-to-image (T2I) models for different content styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMC outperforms previous methods across multiple scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://henghuiding.github.io/SynFMC/</p></details> |

Using structure-from-motion (SfM) as a benchmark for 3D tasks, we investigate if intermediate features from OpenSora, a video generation model, can support camera pose estimation. We first examine native 3D awareness in video generation features by routing raw intermediate outputs to SfM-prediction modules like DUSt3R. Then, we explore the impact of fine-tuning on camera pose estimation to enhance 3D awareness. Results indicate that while video generator features have limited inherent 3D awareness, task-specific supervision significantly boosts their accuracy for camera pose estimation, resulting in competitive performance. The proposed unified model, named JOG3R, produces camera pose estimates with competitive quality without degrading video generation quality.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we demonstrate that diffusion models can also \textit{generate high-performing neural network parameters}. Our approach is simple, utilizing an autoencoder and a diffusion model. The autoencoder extracts latent representations of a subset of the trained neural network parameters. Next, a diffusion model is trained to synthesize these latent representations from random noise. This model then generates new representations, which are passed through the autoencoder's decoder to produce new subsets of high-performing network parameters. Across various architectures and datasets, our approach consistently generates models with comparable or improved performance over trained networks, with minimal additional cost. Notably, we empirically find that the generated models are not memorizing the trained ones. Our results encourage more exploration into the versatile use of diffusion models.

Unlike existing methods, which treat these components as independent, LTX-Video aims to optimize their interaction for improved efficiency and quality. At its core is a carefully designed Video-VAE that achieves a high compression ratio of 1:192, with spatiotemporal downscaling of 32 x 32 x 8 pixels per token, enabled by relocating the patchifying operation from the transformer's input to the VAE's input. Operating in this highly compressed latent space enables the transformer to efficiently perform full spatiotemporal self-attention, which is essential for generating high-resolution videos with temporal consistency. However, the high compression inherently limits the representation of fine details. To address this, our VAE decoder is tasked with both latent-to-pixel conversion and the final denoising step, producing the clean result directly in pixel space. This approach preserves the ability to generate fine details without incurring the runtime cost of a separate upsampling module. Our model supports diverse use cases, including text-to-video and image-to-video generation, with both capabilities trained simultaneously. It achieves faster-than-real-time generation, producing 5 seconds of 24 fps video at 768x512 resolution in just 2 seconds on an Nvidia H100 GPU, outperforming all existing models of similar scale. The source code and pre-trained models are publicly available, setting a new benchmark for accessible and scalable video generation.</p></details> |  |

To generate fine-grained animated transparency channels, existing methods can be roughly divided into video matting algorithms and diffusion-based algorithms. The methods based on video matting have poor performance in dealing with semi-open areas in stickers, while diffusion-based methods are often used to model a single image, which will lead to local flicker when modeling animated stickers. In this paper, we firstly propose an ILDiff method to generate animated transparent channels through implicit layout distillation, which solves the problems of semi-open area collapse and no consideration of temporal information in existing methods. Secondly, we create the Transparent Animated Sticker Dataset (TASD), which contains 0.32M high-quality samples with transparent channel, to provide data support for related fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ILDiff can produce finer and smoother transparent channels compared to other methods such as Matting Anything and Layer Diffusion.

Some works attempt to extend this approach to autonomous driving by building video-based world models capable of generating realistic future video sequences and predicting ego states. However, prior works tend to produce unsatisfactory results, as the classic GPT framework is designed to handle 1D contextual information, such as text, and lacks the inherent ability to model the spatial and temporal dynamics essential for video generation. In this paper, we present DrivingWorld, a GPT-style world model for autonomous driving, featuring several spatial-temporal fusion mechanisms. This design enables effective modeling of both spatial and temporal dynamics, facilitating high-fidelity, long-duration video generation. Specifically, we propose a next-state prediction strategy to model temporal coherence between consecutive frames and apply a next-token prediction strategy to capture spatial information within each frame. To further enhance generalization ability, we propose a novel masking strategy and reweighting strategy for token prediction to mitigate long-term drifting issues and enable precise control. Our work demonstrates the ability to produce high-fidelity and consistent video clips of over 40 seconds in duration, which is over 2 times longer than state-of-the-art driving world models. Experiments show that, in contrast to prior works, our method achieves superior visual quality and significantly more accurate controllable future video generation.

However, generating videos from text is a more challenging task than generating images from text, due to the much larger dataset and higher computational cost required. Most existing video generation methods use either a 3D U-Net architecture that considers the temporal dimension or autoregressive generation. These methods require large datasets and are limited in terms of computational costs compared to text-to-image generation. To tackle these challenges, we propose a simple but effective novel grid diffusion for text-to-video generation without temporal dimension in architecture and a large text-video paired dataset. We can generate a high-quality video using a fixed amount of GPU memory regardless of the number of frames by representing the video as a grid image. Additionally, since our method reduces the dimensions of the video to the dimensions of the image, various image-based methods can be applied to videos, such as text-guided video manipulation from image manipulation.

| **[VideoMaker: Zero-shot Customized Video Generation with the Inherent Force of Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19645v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot customized video generation has gained significant attention due to its substantial application potential. Existing methods rely on additional models to extract and inject reference subject features, assuming that the Video Diffusion Model (VDM) alone is insufficient for zero-shot customized video generation. However, these methods often struggle to maintain consistent subject appearance due to suboptimal feature extraction and injection techniques. In this paper, we reveal that VDM inherently possesses the force to extract and inject subject features. Departing from previous heuristic approaches, we introduce a novel framework that leverages VDM's inherent force to enable high-quality zero-shot customized video generation. Specifically, for feature extraction, we directly input reference images into VDM and use its intrinsic feature extraction process, which not only provides fine-grained features but also significantly aligns with VDM's pre-trained knowledge. For feature injection, we devise an innovative bidirectional interaction between subject features and generated content through spatial self-attention within VDM, ensuring that VDM has better subject fidelity while maintaining the diversity of the generated video. Experiments on both customized human and object video generation validate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wutao-cs.github.io/VideoMaker/</p></details> |

However, these methods offer limited or sometimes no control to users on camera aspects, including dynamic camera motion, zoom, distorted lens and focus shifts. These motion and optical aspects are crucial for adding controllability and cinematic elements to generation frameworks, ultimately resulting in visual content that draws focus, enhances mood, and guides emotions according to filmmakers' controls. In this paper, we aim to close the gap between controllable video generation and camera optics. To achieve this, we propose AKiRa (Augmentation Kit on Rays), a novel augmentation framework that builds and trains a camera adapter with a complex camera model over an existing video generation backbone. It enables fine-tuned control over camera motion as well as complex optical parameters (focal length, distortion, aperture) to achieve cinematic effects such as zoom, fisheye effect, and bokeh. Extensive experiments demonstrate AKiRa's effectiveness in combining and composing camera optics while outperforming all state-of-the-art methods. This work sets a new landmark in controlled and optically enhanced video generation, paving the way for future optical video generation methods.</p></details> |  |

While significant breakthroughs have been made in AI language ability, artificial visual intelligence, especially the ability to generate and simulate the world we see, is far lagging behind. To facilitate the development and accessibility of artificial visual intelligence, we created Open-Sora, an open-source video generation model designed to produce high-fidelity video content. Open-Sora supports a wide spectrum of visual generation tasks, including text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation, and image-to-video generation. The model leverages advanced deep learning architectures and training/inference techniques to enable flexible video synthesis, which could generate video content of up to 15 seconds, up to 720p resolution, and arbitrary aspect ratios. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Diffusion Transformer (STDiT), an efficient diffusion framework for videos that decouples spatial and temporal attention. We also introduce a highly compressive 3D autoencoder to make representations compact and further accelerate training with an ad hoc training strategy. Through this initiative, we aim to foster innovation, creativity, and inclusivity within the community of AI content creation. By embracing the open-source principle, Open-Sora democratizes full access to all the training/inference/data preparation codes as well as model weights.

| **[AdaDiff: Adaptive Step Selection for Fast Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14768v2)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, as a type of generative model, have achieved impressive results in generating images and videos conditioned on textual conditions. However, the generation process of diffusion models involves denoising dozens of steps to produce photorealistic images/videos, which is computationally expensive. Unlike previous methods that design ``one-size-fits-all'' approaches for speed up, we argue denoising steps should be sample-specific conditioned on the richness of input texts. To this end, we introduce AdaDiff, a lightweight framework designed to learn instance-specific step usage policies, which are then used by the diffusion model for generation. AdaDiff is optimized using a policy gradient method to maximize a carefully designed reward function, balancing inference time and generation quality. We conduct experiments on three image generation and two video generation benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach achieves similar visual quality compared to the baseline using a fixed 50 denoising steps while reducing inference time by at least 33%, going as high as 40%. Furthermore, our method can be used on top of other acceleration methods to provide further speed benefits. Lastly, qualitative analysis shows that AdaDiff allocates more steps to more informative prompts and fewer steps to simpler prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we demonstrate that through a careful design of a generative video propagation framework, various video tasks can be addressed in a unified way by leveraging the generative power of such models. Specifically, our framework, GenProp, encodes the original video with a selective content encoder and propagates the changes made to the first frame using an image-to-video generation model. We propose a data generation scheme to cover multiple video tasks based on instance-level video segmentation datasets. Our model is trained by incorporating a mask prediction decoder head and optimizing a region-aware loss to aid the encoder to preserve the original content while the generation model propagates the modified region. This novel design opens up new possibilities: In editing scenarios, GenProp allows substantial changes to an object's shape; for insertion, the inserted objects can exhibit independent motion; for removal, GenProp effectively removes effects like shadows and reflections from the whole video; for tracking, GenProp is capable of tracking objects and their associated effects together. Experiment results demonstrate the leading performance of our model in various video tasks, and we further provide in-depth analyses of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 11 pages, 18 figures |
| **[CustomCrafter: Customized Video Generation with Preserving Motion and Concept Composition Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13239v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customized video generation aims to generate high-quality videos guided by text prompts and subject's reference images. However, since it is only trained on static images, the fine-tuning process of subject learning disrupts abilities of video diffusion models (VDMs) to combine concepts and generate motions. To restore these abilities, some methods use additional video similar to the prompt to fine-tune or guide the model. This requires frequent changes of guiding videos and even re-tuning of the model when generating different motions, which is very inconvenient for users. In this paper, we propose CustomCrafter, a novel framework that preserves the model's motion generation and conceptual combination abilities without additional video and fine-tuning to recovery. For preserving conceptual combination ability, we design a plug-and-play module to update few parameters in VDMs, enhancing the model's ability to capture the appearance details and the ability of concept combinations for new subjects. For motion generation, we observed that VDMs tend to restore the motion of video in the early stage of denoising, while focusing on the recovery of subject details in the later stage. Therefore, we propose Dynamic Weighted Video Sampling Strategy. Using the pluggability of our subject learning modules, we reduce the impact of this module on motion generation in the early stage of denoising, preserving the ability to generate motion of VDMs. In the later stage of denoising, we restore this module to repair the appearance details of the specified subject, thereby ensuring the fidelity of the subject's appearance. Experimental results show that our method has a significant improvement compared to previous methods.

| **[Benchmarking Multi-dimensional AIGC Video Quality Assessment: A Dataset and Unified Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21408v2)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven video generation has gained significant attention. Consequently, there is a growing need for accurate video quality assessment (VQA) metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of AI-generated content (AIGC) videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of AIGC videos remains a significant challenge because these videos often exhibit highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and irrational objects. To address this challenge, we systematically investigate the AIGC-VQA problem, considering both subjective and objective quality assessment perspectives. For the subjective perspective, we construct the Large-scale Generated Video Quality assessment (LGVQ) dataset, consisting of 2,808 AIGC videos generated by 6 video generation models using 468 carefully curated text prompts. We evaluate the perceptual quality of AIGC videos from three critical dimensions: spatial quality, temporal quality, and text-video alignment. For the objective perspective, we establish a benchmark for evaluating existing quality assessment metrics on the LGVQ dataset. Our findings show that current metrics perform poorly on this dataset, highlighting a gap in effective evaluation tools. To bridge this gap, we propose the Unify Generated Video Quality assessment (UGVQ) model, designed to accurately evaluate the multi-dimensional quality of AIGC videos. The UGVQ model integrates the visual and motion features of videos with the textual features of their corresponding prompts, forming a unified quality-aware feature representation tailored to AIGC videos. Experimental results demonstrate that UGVQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LGVQ dataset across all three quality dimensions. Both the LGVQ dataset and the UGVQ model are publicly available on https://github.com/zczhang-sjtu/UGVQ.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Dual Feature Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18911v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the dominant methods in image and video generation yet still suffer substantial computational costs. As an effective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed to cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next timesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However, on the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous timesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand, conservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but still computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation quality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a tradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper begins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features. Surprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly more caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching can fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual caching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively, leading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same time. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise conservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no training and calibration data.

However, existing approaches mainly focus on single-object video generation with pose guidance, ignoring the realistic situation that multi-character appear concurrently in a scenario. To tackle this, we propose a novel multi-character video generation framework in a tuning-free manner, which is based on the separated text and pose guidance. Specifically, we first extract character masks from the pose sequence to identify the spatial position for each generating character, and then single prompts for each character are obtained with LLMs for precise text guidance. Moreover, the spatial-aligned cross attention and multi-branch control module are proposed to generate fine grained controllable multi-character video. The visualized results of generating video demonstrate the precise controllability of our method for multi-character generation. We also verify the generality of our method by applying it to various personalized T2I models. Moreover, the quantitative results show that our approach achieves superior performance compared with previous works.</p></details> | 5 pages,conference |

However, current video diffusion models need high computational costs and produce suboptimal results due to extreme complexity of video generation task. In this paper, we propose \textbf{ConFiner}, an efficient video generation framework that decouples video generation into easier subtasks: structure \textbf{con}trol and spatial-temporal re\textbf{fine}ment. It can generate high-quality videos with chain of off-the-shelf diffusion model experts, each expert responsible for a decoupled subtask. During the refinement, we introduce coordinated denoising, which can merge multiple diffusion experts' capabilities into a single sampling. Furthermore, we design ConFiner-Long framework, which can generate long coherent video with three constraint strategies on ConFiner. Experimental results indicate that with only 10\% of the inference cost, our ConFiner surpasses representative models like Lavie and Modelscope across all objective and subjective metrics. And ConFiner-Long can generate high-quality and coherent videos with up to 600 frames.</p></details> |  |

As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of O(N^2), compared to O(N) for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3.

Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating extended videos remains a formidable challenge. As of this writing, OpenAI's Sora, the current state-of-the-art system, is still limited to producing videos that are up to one minute in length. This limitation stems from the complexity of long video generation, which requires more than generative AI techniques for approximating density functions essential aspects such as planning, story development, and maintaining spatial and temporal consistency present additional hurdles. Integrating generative AI with a divide-and-conquer approach could improve scalability for longer videos while offering greater control. In this survey, we examine the current landscape of long video generation, covering foundational techniques like GANs and diffusion models, video generation strategies, large-scale training datasets, quality metrics for evaluating long videos, and future research areas to address the limitations of the existing video generation capabilities. We believe it would serve as a comprehensive foundation, offering extensive information to guide future advancements and research in the field of long video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 18 figures, Manuscript submitted to ACM</p></details> |

However, current driving world models primarily rely on video diffusion models, which specialize in visual generation but lack the flexibility to incorporate other modalities like action. In contrast, autoregressive transformers have demonstrated exceptional capability in modeling multimodal data. Our work aims to unify both driving model simulation and trajectory planning into a single sequence modeling problem. We introduce a multimodal driving language based on interleaved image and action tokens, and develop DrivingGPT to learn joint world modeling and planning through standard next-token prediction. Our DrivingGPT demonstrates strong performance in both action-conditioned video generation and end-to-end planning, outperforming strong baselines on large-scale nuPlan and NAVSIM benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/</p></details> |

However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 19 figures, Project page: https://onevfall.github.io/project_page/ditctrl ; GitHub repository: https://github.com/TencentARC/DiTCtrl</p></details> |

To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrixes $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrixes $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK$. Third, we propose to use an FP32 Matmul buffer for $PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 5x on RTX4090, respectively.

Directly applying image VAEs to individual frames in isolation can result in temporal inconsistencies and suboptimal compression rates due to a lack of temporal compression. Existing Video VAEs have begun to address temporal compression; however, they often suffer from inadequate reconstruction performance. In this paper, we present a novel and powerful video autoencoder capable of high-fidelity video encoding. First, we observe that entangling spatial and temporal compression by merely extending the image VAE to a 3D VAE can introduce motion blur and detail distortion artifacts. Thus, we propose temporal-aware spatial compression to better encode and decode the spatial information. Additionally, we integrate a lightweight motion compression model for further temporal compression. Second, we propose to leverage the textual information inherent in text-to-video datasets and incorporate text guidance into our model. This significantly enhances reconstruction quality, particularly in terms of detail preservation and temporal stability. Third, we further improve the versatility of our model through joint training on both images and videos, which not only enhances reconstruction quality but also enables the model to perform both image and video autoencoding. Extensive evaluations against strong recent baselines demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

In this paper, we propose a novel and compact video autoencoder, VidTwin, that decouples video into two distinct latent spaces: Structure latent vectors, which capture overall content and global movement, and Dynamics latent vectors, which represent fine-grained details and rapid movements. Specifically, our approach leverages an Encoder-Decoder backbone, augmented with two submodules for extracting these latent spaces, respectively. The first submodule employs a Q-Former to extract low-frequency motion trends, followed by downsampling blocks to remove redundant content details. The second averages the latent vectors along the spatial dimension to capture rapid motion. Extensive experiments show that VidTwin achieves a high compression rate of 0.20% with high reconstruction quality (PSNR of 28.14 on the MCL-JCV dataset), and performs efficiently and effectively in downstream generative tasks. Moreover, our model demonstrates explainability and scalability, paving the way for future research in video latent representation and generation.

This paper proposes a substation equipment fault analysis method based on a multimodal large language model (MLLM). We developed a database containing 40,000 entries, including images, defect labels, and analysis reports, and used an image-to-video generation model for data augmentation. Detailed fault analysis reports were generated using GPT-4. Based on this database, we developed SubstationAI, the first model dedicated to substation fault analysis, and designed a fault diagnosis knowledge base along with knowledge enhancement methods. Experimental results show that SubstationAI significantly outperforms existing models, such as GPT-4, across various evaluation metrics, demonstrating higher accuracy and practicality in fault cause analysis, repair suggestions, and preventive measures, providing a more advanced solution for substation equipment fault analysis.</p></details> |  |

Existing 3D generative models cannot yet match the fidelity of image or video generative models. State-of-the-art 3D generators are either trained with explicit 3D supervision and are thus limited by the volume and diversity of existing 3D data. Meanwhile, generators that can be trained with only 2D data as supervision typically produce coarser results, cannot be text-conditioned, or must revert to test-time optimization. We observe that GAN- and diffusion-based generators have complementary qualities: GANs can be trained efficiently with 2D supervision to produce high-quality 3D objects but are hard to condition on text. In contrast, denoising diffusion models can be conditioned efficiently but tend to be hard to train with only 2D supervision. We introduce GANFusion, which starts by generating unconditional triplane features for 3D data using a GAN architecture trained with only single-view 2D data. We then generate random samples from the GAN, caption them, and train a text-conditioned diffusion model that directly learns to sample from the space of good triplane features that can be decoded into 3D objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ganfusion.github.io/</p></details> |

Nevertheless, they often require a large amount of memory and time overhead during inference, due to the complex network architecture and considerable number of timesteps for iterative diffusion. Recently, the post-training quantization (PTQ) technique has proved a promising way to reduce the inference cost by quantizing the float-point operations to low-bit ones. However, most of them fail to tackle with the large variations in the distribution of activations across distinct channels and timesteps, as well as the inconsistent of input between quantization and inference on diffusion models, thus leaving much room for improvement. To address the above issues, we propose a novel method dubbed Timestep-Channel Adaptive Quantization for Diffusion Models (TCAQ-DM). Specifically, we develop a timestep-channel joint reparameterization (TCR) module to balance the activation range along both the timesteps and channels, facilitating the successive reconstruction procedure. Subsequently, we employ a dynamically adaptive quantization (DAQ) module that mitigate the quantization error by selecting an optimal quantizer for each post-Softmax layers according to their specific types of distributions. Moreover, we present a progressively aligned reconstruction (PAR) strategy to mitigate the bias caused by the input mismatch. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and distinct diffusion models demonstrate that the proposed method substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in most cases, especially yielding comparable FID metrics to the full precision model on CIFAR-10 in the W6A6 setting, while enabling generating available images in the W4A4 settings.</p></details> |  |

We propose VAST (Video As Storyboard from Text), a two-stage framework to address these challenges and enable high-quality video generation. In the first stage, StoryForge transforms textual descriptions into detailed storyboards, capturing human poses and object layouts to represent the structural essence of the scene. In the second stage, VisionForge generates videos from these storyboards, producing high-quality videos with smooth motion, temporal consistency, and spatial coherence. By decoupling text understanding from video generation, VAST enables precise control over subject dynamics and scene composition. Experiments on the VBench benchmark demonstrate that VAST outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic expression, setting a new standard for dynamic and coherent video generation.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we propose a simple pipeline to leverage in-context generation: ($\textbf{i}$) concatenate videos along spacial or time dimension, ($\textbf{ii}$) jointly caption multi-scene video clips from one source, and ($\textbf{iii}$) apply task-specific fine-tuning using carefully curated small datasets. Through a series of diverse controllable tasks, we demonstrate qualitatively that existing advanced text-to-video models can effectively perform in-context generation. Notably, it allows for the creation of consistent multi-scene videos exceeding 30 seconds in duration, without additional computational overhead. Importantly, this method requires no modifications to the original models, results in high-fidelity video outputs that better align with prompt specifications and maintain role consistency. Our framework presents a valuable tool for the research community and offers critical insights for advancing product-level controllable video generation systems.

Reducing sampling steps often compromises video quality or generation diversity. In this work, we introduce a distillation method that combines variational score distillation and consistency distillation to achieve few-step video generation, maintaining both high quality and diversity. We also propose a latent reward model fine-tuning approach to further enhance video generation performance according to any specified reward metric. This approach reduces memory usage and does not require the reward to be differentiable. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in few-step generation for 10-second videos (128 frames at 12 FPS). The distilled student model achieves a score of 82.57 on VBench, surpassing the teacher model as well as baseline models Gen-3, T2V-Turbo, and Kling. One-step distillation accelerates the teacher model's diffusion sampling by up to 278.6 times, enabling near real-time generation. Human evaluations further validate the superior performance of our 4-step student models compared to teacher model using 50-step DDIM sampling.</p></details> |  |

The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that enables bidirectional information exchange between our backbone video and audio diffusion models through a temporally-aligned self attention operation. Unlike prior work that uses feature extractors pretrained for other tasks for the conditioning signal, AV-Link can directly leverage features obtained by the complementary modality in a single framework i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video. We extensively evaluate our design choices and demonstrate the ability of our method to achieve synchronized and high-quality audiovisual content, showcasing its potential for applications in immersive media generation.

However, applying these models to video relighting remains challenging due to the lack of paired video relighting datasets and the high demands for output fidelity and temporal consistency, further complicated by the inherent randomness of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we introduce RelightVid, a flexible framework for video relighting that can accept background video, text prompts, or environment maps as relighting conditions. Trained on in-the-wild videos with carefully designed illumination augmentations and rendered videos under extreme dynamic lighting, RelightVid achieves arbitrary video relighting with high temporal consistency without intrinsic decomposition while preserving the illumination priors of its image backbone.</p></details> |  |

A major challenge in this domain is the depth at which images are captured, with increasing depth resulting in a darker environment. Most existing methods for underwater image enhancement focus on noise removal and color adjustment, with few works dedicated to brightness enhancement. This work introduces a novel unsupervised learning approach to underwater image enhancement using a diffusion model. Our method, called UDBE, is based on conditional diffusion to maintain the brightness details of the unpaired input images. The input image is combined with a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation map (SNR) to ensure stable training and prevent color distortion in the output images. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate in the datasets UIEB, SUIM and RUIE, well-established underwater image benchmarks. Additionally, the experiments validate the robustness of our approach, regarding the image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, and UISM, indicating the good performance of the brightness enhancement process.

| **[Efficient Portrait Matte Creation With Layer Diffusion and Connectivity Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16147v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective deep portrait matting models requires training data of both high quality and large quantity. Neither quality nor quantity can be easily met for portrait matting, however. Since the most accurate ground-truth portrait mattes are acquired in front of the green screen, it is almost impossible to harvest a large-scale portrait matting dataset in reality. This work shows that one can leverage text prompts and the recent Layer Diffusion model to generate high-quality portrait foregrounds and extract latent portrait mattes. However, the portrait mattes cannot be readily in use due to significant generation artifacts. Inspired by the connectivity priors observed in portrait images, that is, the border of portrait foregrounds always appears connected, a connectivity-aware approach is introduced to refine portrait mattes. Building on this, a large-scale portrait matting dataset is created, termed LD-Portrait-20K, with $20,051$ portrait foregrounds and high-quality alpha mattes. Extensive experiments demonstrated the value of the LD-Portrait-20K dataset, with models trained on it significantly outperforming those trained on other datasets. In addition, comparisons with the chroma keying algorithm and an ablation study on dataset capacity further confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed matte creation approach. Further, the dataset also contributes to state-of-the-art video portrait matting, implemented by simple video segmentation and a trimap-based image matting model trained on this dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Tropical Cyclone Forecasting With Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16003v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.

However, current visual prompt methods rely on a pretrained text-guided image-to-image generative model that requires a triplet of text, before, and after images for retraining over a text-to-image model. Such crafting triplets and retraining processes limit the scalability and generalization of editing. In this paper, we present a framework based on any single text-to-image model without reliance on the explicit image-to-image model thus enhancing the generalizability and scalability. Specifically, by leveraging the probability-flow ordinary equation, we construct a diffusion bridge to transfer the distribution between before-and-after images under the text guidance. By optimizing the text via the bridge, the framework adaptively textualizes the editing transformation conveyed by visual prompts into text embeddings without other models. Meanwhile, we introduce differential attention control during text optimization, which disentangles the text embedding from the invariance of the before-and-after images and makes it solely capture the delicate transformation and generalize to edit various images. Experiments on real images validate competitive results on the generalization, contextual coherence, and high fidelity for delicate editing with just one image pair as the visual prompt.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Despite the notable success of diffusion techniques in generation tasks, their adaptation to speech separation has encountered challenges, notably slow convergence and suboptimal separation outcomes. To address these issues and enhance the efficacy of diffusion-based speech separation, we introduce EDSep, a novel single-channel method grounded in score matching via stochastic differential equation (SDE). This method enhances generative modeling for speech source separation by optimizing training and sampling efficiency. Specifically, a novel denoiser function is proposed to approximate data distributions, which obtains ideal denoiser outputs. Additionally, a stochastic sampler is carefully designed to resolve the reverse SDE during the sampling process, gradually separating speech from mixtures. Extensive experiments on databases such as WSJ0-2mix, LRS2-2mix, and VoxCeleb2-2mix demonstrate our proposed method's superior performance over existing diffusion and discriminative models, validating its efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion based Text-to-Music Generation with Global and Local Text based Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14680v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion based Text-To-Music (TTM) models generate music corresponding to text descriptions. Typically UNet based diffusion models condition on text embeddings generated from a pre-trained large language model or from a cross-modality audio-language representation model. This work proposes a diffusion based TTM, in which the UNet is conditioned on both (i) a uni-modal language model (e.g., T5) via cross-attention and (ii) a cross-modal audio-language representation model (e.g., CLAP) via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). The diffusion model is trained to exploit both a local text representation from the T5 and a global representation from the CLAP. Furthermore, we propose modifications that extract both global and local representations from the T5 through pooling mechanisms that we call mean pooling and self-attention pooling. This approach mitigates the need for an additional encoder (e.g., CLAP) to extract a global representation, thereby reducing the number of model parameters. Our results show that incorporating the CLAP global embeddings to the T5 local embeddings enhances text adherence (KL=1.47) compared to a baseline model solely relying on the T5 local embeddings (KL=1.54). Alternatively, extracting global text embeddings directly from the T5 local embeddings through the proposed mean pooling approach yields superior generation quality (FAD=1.89) while exhibiting marginally inferior text adherence (KL=1.51) against the model conditioned on both CLAP and T5 text embeddings (FAD=1.94 and KL=1.47). Our proposed solution is not only efficient but also compact in terms of the number of parameters required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Polynomial time sampling from log-smooth distributions in fixed dimension under semi-log-concavity of the forward diffusion with application to strongly dissipative distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00565v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we provide a stochastic sampling algorithm with polynomial complexity in fixed dimension that leverages the recent advances on diffusion models where it is shown that under mild conditions, sampling can be achieved via an accurate estimation of intermediate scores across the marginals $(p_t)_{t\ge 0}$ of the standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process started at $\mu$, the density we wish to sample from. The heart of our method consists into approaching these scores via a computationally cheap estimator and relating the variance of this estimator to the smoothness properties of the forward process. Under the assumption that the density to sample from is $L$-log-smooth and that the forward process is semi-log-concave: $-\nabla^2 \log(p_t) \succeq -\beta I_d$ for some $\beta \geq 0$, we prove that our algorithm achieves an expected $\epsilon$ error in $\text{KL}$ divergence in $O(d^7(L+\beta)^2L^{d+2}\epsilon^{-2(d+3)}(d+m_2(\mu))^{2(d+1)})$ time with $m_2(\mu)$ the second order moment of $\mu$. In particular, our result allows to fully transfer the problem of sampling from a log-smooth distribution into a regularity estimate problem. As an application, we derive an exponential complexity improvement for the problem of sampling from an $L$-log-smooth distribution that is $\alpha$-strongly log-concave outside some ball of radius $R$: after proving that such distributions verify the semi-log-concavity assumption, a result which might be of independent interest, we recover a $poly(R, L, \alpha^{-1}, \epsilon^{-1})$ complexity in fixed dimension which exponentially improves upon the previously known $poly(e^{LR^2}, L,\alpha^{-1}, \log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ complexity in the low precision regime.</p></details> |  |

We assume that the diffusion process X is observed at discrete times, at high frequency, which means that the time step tends toward zero. In addition, the drift and diffusion coefficients of the process X are assumed to be unknown. In this paper, we study the minimax rates of convergence of the nonparametric estimators of the square of the diffusion coefficient. Two observation schemes are considered depending on the estimation interval. The square of the diffusion coefficient is estimated on the real line from repeated observations of the process X, where the number of diffusion paths tends to infinity. For the case of a compact estimation interval, we study the nonparametric estimation of the square of the diffusion coefficient constructed from a single diffusion path on one side and from repeated observations on the other side, where the number of trajectories tends to infinity. In each of these cases, we establish minimax convergence rates of the risk of estimation of the diffusion coefficient over a space of Holder functions.</p></details> | 32 pages |

To deal with the input delay, we reformulate the problem as an actuated transport PDE coupled with the original reaction-diffusion PDE. Then, we design a quantized predictor-based feedback mechanism that employs a dynamic switching strategy to adjust the quantization range and error over time. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven properly combining backstepping with a small-gain approach and input-to-state stability techniques, for deriving estimates on solutions, despite the quantization effect and the system's instability. We also extend this result to the input quantization case.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at 2025 American Control Conference (ACC), DENVER, Colorado, USA</p></details> |
| **[Towards Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion for Regional Sea-Level Data Downscaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15628v3)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given coarser-resolution projections from global climate models or satellite data, the downscaling problem aims to estimate finer-resolution regional climate data, capturing fine-scale spatial patterns and variability. Downscaling is any method to derive high-resolution data from low-resolution variables, often to provide more detailed and local predictions and analyses. This problem is societally crucial for effective adaptation, mitigation, and resilience against significant risks from climate change. The challenge arises from spatial heterogeneity and the need to recover finer-scale features while ensuring model generalization. Most downscaling methods \cite{Li2020} fail to capture the spatial dependencies at finer scales and underperform on real-world climate datasets, such as sea-level rise. We propose a novel Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Ki-CDPM) to capture spatial variability while preserving fine-scale features. Experimental results on climate data show that our proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art downscaling techniques.</p></details> |  |

This enhances the alignment of our model with the objects in the input image without using external supervision. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in object discovery and image generation tasks across multiple datasets, including those with real images. Furthermore, we demonstrate through experiments that our method performs remarkably well on complex real-world images for compositional generation, in contrast to other slot-based generative methods in the literature.

Existing approaches tend to leverage the pocket structure of the target protein to condition the molecule generation. However, even the pocket area of the target protein may contain redundant information since not all atoms in the pocket is responsible for the interaction with the ligand. In this work, we propose PharmacoBridge, a phamacophore-guided de novo design approach to generate drug candidates inducing desired bioactivity via diffusion bridge. Our method adapts the diffusion bridge to effectively convert pharmacophore arrangements in the spatial space into molecular structures under the manner of SE(3)-equivariant transformation, providing sophisticated control over optimal biochemical feature arrangements on the generated molecules. PharmacoBridge is demonstrated to generate hit candidates that exhibit high binding affinity with potential protein targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Memorization and Regularization in Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15785v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling. At the heart of the methodology is score matching: learning gradients of families of log-densities for noisy versions of the data distribution at different scales. When the loss function adopted in score matching is evaluated using empirical data, rather than the population loss, the minimizer corresponds to the score of a time-dependent Gaussian mixture. However, use of this analytically tractable minimizer leads to data memorization: in both unconditioned and conditioned settings, the generative model returns the training samples. This paper contains an analysis of the dynamical mechanism underlying memorization. The analysis highlights the need for regularization to avoid reproducing the analytically tractable minimizer; and, in so doing, lays the foundations for a principled understanding of how to regularize. Numerical experiments investigate the properties of: (i) Tikhonov regularization; (ii) regularization designed to promote asymptotic consistency; and (iii) regularizations induced by under-parameterization of a neural network or by early stopping when training a neural network. These experiments are evaluated in the context of memorization, and directions for future development of regularization are highlighted.</p></details> | 58 pages, 20 figures |

Furthermore, our finetuned models can expertly answer questions on specific topics by integrating powerful guidance techniques, and autonomously determine the compute required for a given problem by leveraging adaptive ODE solvers. Our method is universally applicable to any foundation model pre-trained with a cross-entropy loss and does not modify any of its original weights, fully preserving its strong single-step generation capabilities. We show our method is more effective and fully compatible with traditional finetuning approaches, introducing an orthogonal new direction to unify the strengths of the autoregressive and diffusion frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 19 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Despite the discovery of thousands of inscriptions, a vast expanse of OBS remains undeciphered, casting a veil of mystery over this ancient language. The emergence of modern AI technologies presents a novel frontier for OBS decipherment, challenging traditional NLP methods that rely heavily on large textual corpora, a luxury not afforded by historical languages. This paper introduces a novel approach by adopting image generation techniques, specifically through the development of Oracle Bone Script Decipher (OBSD). Utilizing a conditional diffusion-based strategy, OBSD generates vital clues for decipherment, charting a new course for AI-assisted analysis of ancient languages. To validate its efficacy, extensive experiments were conducted on an oracle bone script dataset, with quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of OBSD.

We formulate this problem as an image inpainting task, allowing for more user control over the placement of mirrors during the generation process. To enable this, we create SynMirror, a large-scale dataset of diverse synthetic scenes with objects placed in front of mirrors. SynMirror contains around 198k samples rendered from 66k unique 3D objects, along with their associated depth maps, normal maps and instance-wise segmentation masks, to capture relevant geometric properties of the scene. Using this dataset, we propose a novel depth-conditioned inpainting method called MirrorFusion, which generates high-quality, realistic, shape and appearance-aware reflections of real-world objects. MirrorFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SynMirror, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully tackle the challenging problem of generating controlled and faithful mirror reflections of an object in a scene using diffusion-based models. SynMirror and MirrorFusion open up new avenues for image editing and augmented reality applications for practitioners and researchers alike.

Recent advances in generative models, including diffusion models and geometric deep learning, have demonstrated promise in optimizing ligand generation. However, the scarcity of high-quality protein-ligand complex data and the inherent challenges in aligning generated ligands with target proteins limit the effectiveness of these methods. We propose BoKDiff, a novel framework that enhances ligand generation by combining multi-objective optimization and Best-of-K alignment methodologies. Built upon the DecompDiff model, BoKDiff generates diverse candidates and ranks them using a weighted evaluation of molecular properties such as QED, SA, and docking scores. To address alignment challenges, we introduce a method that relocates the center of mass of generated ligands to their docking poses, enabling accurate sub-component extraction. Additionally, we integrate a Best-of-N (BoN) sampling approach, which selects the optimal ligand from multiple generated candidates without requiring fine-tuning. BoN achieves exceptional results, with QED values exceeding 0.6, SA scores above 0.75, and a success rate surpassing 35%, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality. BoKDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on the CrossDocked2020 dataset, including a -8.58 average Vina docking score and a 26% success rate in molecule generation. This study is the first to apply Best-of-K alignment and Best-of-N sampling to SBDD, highlighting their potential to bridge generative modeling with practical drug discovery requirements.

ST is a time-consuming, expensive yet powerful experimental technique that provides new opportunities to understand cancer mechanisms at a fine-grained molecular level, which is critical for uncovering new approaches for disease diagnosis and treatments. Here, we present $\textbf{Stem}$ ($\textbf{S}$pa$\textbf{T}$ially resolved gene $\textbf{E}$xpression inference with diffusion $\textbf{M}$odel), a novel computational tool that leverages a conditional diffusion generative model to enable in silico gene expression inference from H&E stained images.

Existing methods often struggle with cultural bias, limited scalability, and alignment between textual prompts and generated visuals, particularly under weak supervision. In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to address these challenges. Our method leverages LLMs for semantic refinement of textual prompts and introduces a weak supervision filtering module to effectively utilize noisy or weakly labeled data. By fine-tuning the LDM on an enhanced DeepFashion+ dataset enriched with global fashion styles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Diffusion-Based Planning for Autonomous Driving with Flexible Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15564v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving human-like driving behaviors in complex open-world environments is a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Contemporary learning-based planning approaches such as imitation learning methods often struggle to balance competing objectives and lack of safety assurance,due to limited adaptability and inadequacy in learning complex multi-modal behaviors commonly exhibited in human planning, not to mention their strong reliance on the fallback strategy with predefined rules. We propose a novel transformer-based Diffusion Planner for closed-loop planning, which can effectively model multi-modal driving behavior and ensure trajectory quality without any rule-based refinement. Our model supports joint modeling of both prediction and planning tasks under the same architecture, enabling cooperative behaviors between vehicles. Moreover, by learning the gradient of the trajectory score function and employing a flexible classifier guidance mechanism, Diffusion Planner effectively achieves safe and adaptable planning behaviors. Evaluations on the large-scale real-world autonomous planning benchmark nuPlan and our newly collected 200-hour delivery-vehicle driving dataset demonstrate that Diffusion Planner achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance with robust transferability in diverse driving styles.</p></details> |  |

With the limitation of privacy and safety in practice, the generative capability concerning NSFW (Not Safe For Work) concepts is undesirable, e.g., producing sexually explicit photos, and licensed images. The concept erasure task for T2I diffusion models has attracted considerable attention and requires an effective and efficient method. To achieve this goal, we propose a CE-SDWV framework, which removes the target concepts (e.g., NSFW concepts) of T2I diffusion models in the text semantic space by only adjusting the text condition tokens and does not need to re-train the original T2I diffusion model's weights. Specifically, our framework first builds a target concept-related word vocabulary to enhance the representation of the target concepts within the text semantic space, and then utilizes an adaptive semantic component suppression strategy to ablate the target concept-related semantic information in the text condition tokens. To further adapt the above text condition tokens to the original image semantic space, we propose an end-to-end gradient-orthogonal token optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on I2P and UnlearnCanvas benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> | 24 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Distributionally Robust Graph Out-of-Distribution Recommendation via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15555v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based graph neural network methods improve recommendation systems' out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization by optimizing the model's worst-case performance. However, these studies fail to consider the impact of noisy samples in the training data, which results in diminished generalization capabilities and lower accuracy. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, this paper reveals that current DRO-based graph recommendation methods assign greater weight to noise distribution, leading to model parameter learning being dominated by it. When the model overly focuses on fitting noise samples in the training data, it may learn irrelevant or meaningless features that cannot be generalized to OOD data. To address this challenge, we design a Distributionally Robust Graph model for OOD recommendation (DRGO). Specifically, our method first employs a simple and effective diffusion paradigm to alleviate the noisy effect in the latent space. Additionally, an entropy regularization term is introduced in the DRO objective function to avoid extreme sample weights in the worst-case distribution. Finally, we provide a theoretical proof of the generalization error bound of DRGO as well as a theoretical analysis of how our approach mitigates noisy sample effects, which helps to better understand the proposed framework from a theoretical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework against three typical distribution shifts, and the results demonstrate its superiority in both independently and identically distributed distributions (IID) and OOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, Accepted by WWW'25</p></details> |
| **[Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by WWW2025</p></details> |

However, generating high-quality content remains notably slow because it requires running model inference over many time steps. To accelerate these models, we propose to aggressively quantize both weights and activations, while simultaneously promoting significant activation sparsity. We further observe that the stated sparsity pattern varies among different channels and evolves across time steps. To support this quantization and sparsity scheme, we present a novel diffusion model accelerator featuring a heterogeneous mixed-precision dense-sparse architecture, channel-last address mapping, and a time-step-aware sparsity detector for efficient handling of the sparsity pattern. Our 4-bit quantization technique demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing 4-bit methods. Our custom accelerator achieves 6.91x speed-up and 51.5% energy reduction compared to traditional dense accelerators.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The zero-shot generation of various visual content using a pretrained image diffusion model has been explored mainly in two directions. First, Diffusion Synchronization-performing reverse diffusion processes jointly across different projected spaces while synchronizing them in the target space-generates high-quality outputs when enough conditioning is provided, but it struggles in its absence. Second, Score Distillation Sampling-gradually updating the target space data through gradient descent-results in better coherence but often lacks detail. In this paper, we reveal for the first time the interconnection between these two methods while highlighting their differences. To this end, we propose StochSync, a novel approach that combines the strengths of both, enabling effective performance with weak conditioning. Our experiments demonstrate that StochSync provides the best performance in 360{\deg} panorama generation (where image conditioning is not given), outperforming previous finetuning-based methods, and also delivers comparable results in 3D mesh texturing (where depth conditioning is provided) with previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://stochsync.github.io/ (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

DSMs capture detailed elevations of natural and manmade features, crucial for applications like urban planning, vegetation studies, and 3D reconstruction. However, DSMs derived from stereo satellite imagery often contain voids or missing data due to occlusions, shadows, and lowsignal areas. Previous studies have primarily focused on void filling for digital elevation models (DEMs) and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), employing methods such as inverse distance weighting (IDW), kriging, and spline interpolation. While effective for simpler terrains, these approaches often fail to handle the intricate structures present in DSMs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dfilled, a guided DSM void filling method that leverages optical remote sensing images through edge-enhancing diffusion. Dfilled repurposes deep anisotropic diffusion models, which originally designed for super-resolution tasks, to inpaint DSMs. Additionally, we utilize Perlin noise to create inpainting masks that mimic natural void patterns in DSMs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Dfilled surpasses traditional interpolation methods and deep learning approaches in DSM void filling tasks. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the method's ability to manage complex features and deliver accurate, visually coherent results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision Workshops (WACVW)</p></details> |

By introducing a multi-layered diffusion process grounded in spectral analysis, it achieves a complex balance between global and local semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in perplexity and BLEU scores, emphasizing the mechanism's ability to adapt effectively across diverse domains, including multilingual and cross-domain text generation. A rigorous mathematical framework underpins the embedding diffusion process, incorporating weighted adjacency matrices, kernel-based refinements, and dynamic layer-wise normalization. Error distribution analysis reveals that SLED addresses challenges in semantic alignment and coherence, outperforming baseline approaches across varied benchmarks. Scalability studies illustrate that its performance gains are maintained consistently across different model sizes, reflecting a practical balance between computational efficiency and linguistic precision. The implementation also achieves energy efficiency, reducing resource consumption during training and inference phases without compromising accuracy. Qualitative case studies further validate its adaptability to extended narratives and context-intensive scenarios, highlighting the mechanism's potential for real-world applications. SLED offers a different perspective on embedding design and its implications for advancing language modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15393v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to address the critical issue of missing knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) for their better applications. However, both the previous MMGKC and negative sampling (NS) approaches ignore the employment of multimodal information to generate diverse and high-quality negative triples from various semantic levels and hardness levels, thereby limiting the effectiveness of training MMKGC models. Thus, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling (DHNS) scheme tailored for MMKGC tasks, which tackles the challenge of generating high-quality negative triples by leveraging a Diffusion-based Hierarchical Embedding Generation (DiffHEG) that progressively conditions on entities and relations as well as multimodal semantics. Furthermore, we develop a Negative Triple-Adaptive Training (NTAT) strategy that dynamically adjusts training margins associated with the hardness level of the synthesized negative triples, facilitating a more robust and effective learning procedure to distinguish between positive and negative triples. Extensive experiments on three MMKGC benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms several state-of-the-art MMKGC models and negative sampling techniques, illustrating the effectiveness of our DHNS for training MMKGC models.

With the latest advancements in controllable T2I diffusion models, increasing research has focused on rendering text within synthesized images. Despite improvements in text rendering accuracy, the field of automatic poster generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an automatic poster generation framework with text rendering capabilities leveraging LLMs, utilizing a triple-cross attention mechanism based on alignment learning. This framework aims to create precise poster text within a detailed contextual background. Additionally, the framework supports controllable fonts, adjustable image resolution, and the rendering of posters with descriptions and text in both English and Chinese.Furthermore, we introduce a high-resolution font dataset and a poster dataset with resolutions exceeding 1024 pixels.

Yet, current methodologies predominantly depend on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which face two critical limitations: (1) Finetuning imposes prohibitive computational overhead and long-term maintenance costs. (2) Finetuning narrows the pretrained knowledge distribution of MLLMs, reducing their adaptability to novel scenarios. These issues are exacerbated by the inherently dynamic nature of real-world I-TIR systems, where queries and image databases evolve in complexity and diversity, often deviating from static training distributions. To overcome these constraints, we propose Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a paradigm-shifting framework that bypasses MLLM finetuning entirely. DAR synergizes Large Language Model (LLM)-guided query refinement with Diffusion Model (DM)-based visual synthesis to create contextually enriched intermediate representations. This dual-modality approach deciphers nuanced user intent more holistically, enabling precise alignment between textual queries and visually relevant images. Rigorous evaluations across four benchmarks reveal DAR's dual strengths: (1) Matches state-of-the-art finetuned I-TIR models on straightforward queries without task-specific training. (2) Scalable Generalization: Surpasses finetuned baselines by 7.61% in Hits@10 (top-10 accuracy) under multi-turn conversational complexity, demonstrating robustness to intricate, distributionally shifted interactions. By eliminating finetuning dependencies and leveraging generative-augmented representations, DAR establishes a new trajectory for efficient, adaptive, and scalable cross-modal retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |

However, solutions often use the standard albeit computationally intensive route of training and inferring with the whole image on the diffusion prior. While patch-based approaches to evaluating diffusion priors in plug-and-play methods have received some interest, they remain an open area of study. In this work, we explore the feasibility of the usage of patches for training and inference of a diffusion prior on MRI images. We explore the minor adaptation necessary for artifact avoidance, the performance and the efficiency of memory usage of patch-based methods as well as the adaptability of whole image training to patch-based evaluation - evaluating across multiple plug-and-play methods, tasks and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium for Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2025</p></details> |

A common scheme in recent methods involves intrinsically decomposing an input image into 3D shape, albedo, and lighting, then recomposing it with the target lighting. However, estimating these components is error-prone and requires many training examples with ground-truth lighting to generalize well. Our work bypasses the need for accurate intrinsic estimation and can be trained solely on 2D images without any light stage data, relit pairs, multi-view images, or lighting ground truth. Our key idea is to leverage a conditional diffusion implicit model (DDIM) for decoding a disentangled light encoding along with other encodings related to 3D shape and facial identity inferred from off-the-shelf estimators. We propose a novel conditioning technique that simplifies modeling the complex interaction between light and geometry. It uses a rendered shading reference along with a shadow map, inferred using a simple and effective technique, to spatially modulate the DDIM. Moreover, we propose a single-shot relighting framework that requires just one network pass, given pre-processed data, and even outperforms the teacher model across all metrics. Our method realistically relights in-the-wild images with temporally consistent cast shadows under varying lighting conditions. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark Multi-PIE and rank highest in user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>DiFaR...</summary><p>DiFaReli++ extends our previous work DiFaReli (ICCV 2023)</p></details> |

However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on the pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the spatial self-attention layer with the proposed short-long-range (SLR) temporal attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy to improve temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance.

However, the availability of high-quality annotated ultrasound images is limited, which restricts the training of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models to generate synthetic ultrasound images to improve the performance on fetal plane classification. We train different classifiers first on synthetic images and then fine-tune them with real images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that incorporating generated images into training pipelines leads to better classification accuracy than training with real images alone. The findings suggest that generating synthetic data using diffusion models can be a valuable tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in ultrasound medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Pruning in Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12523v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data pruning is the problem of identifying a core subset that is most beneficial to training and discarding the remainder. While pruning strategies are well studied for discriminative models like those used in classification, little research has gone into their application to generative models. Generative models aim to estimate the underlying distribution of the data, so presumably they should benefit from larger datasets. In this work we aim to shed light on the accuracy of this statement, specifically answer the question of whether data pruning for generative diffusion models could have a positive impact. Contrary to intuition, we show that eliminating redundant or noisy data in large datasets is beneficial particularly when done strategically. We experiment with several pruning methods including recent-state-of-art methods, and evaluate over CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. We demonstrate that a simple clustering method outperforms other sophisticated and computationally demanding methods. We further exhibit how we can leverage clustering to balance skewed datasets in an unsupervised manner to allow fair sampling for underrepresented populations in the data distribution, which is a crucial problem in generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffCom: Channel Received Signal is a Natural Condition to Guide Diffusion Posterior Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07390v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end visual communication systems typically optimize a trade-off between channel bandwidth costs and signal-level distortion metrics. However, under challenging physical conditions, this traditional coding and transmission paradigm often results in unrealistic reconstructions with perceptible blurring and aliasing artifacts, despite the inclusion of perceptual or adversarial losses for optimizing. This issue primarily stems from the receiver's limited knowledge about the underlying data manifold and the use of deterministic decoding mechanisms. To address these limitations, this paper introduces DiffCom, a novel end-to-end generative communication paradigm that utilizes off-the-shelf generative priors and probabilistic diffusion models for decoding, thereby improving perceptual quality without heavily relying on bandwidth costs and received signal quality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on deterministic decoders optimized solely for distortion metrics, our DiffCom leverages raw channel-received signal as a fine-grained condition to guide stochastic posterior sampling. Our approach ensures that reconstructions remain on the manifold of real data with a novel confirming constraint, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the generated outcomes. Furthermore, DiffCom incorporates a blind posterior sampling technique to address scenarios with unknown forward transmission characteristics. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate that DiffCom not only produces realistic reconstructions with details faithful to the original data but also achieves superior robustness against diverse wireless transmission degradations. Collectively, these advancements establish DiffCom as a new benchmark in designing generative communication systems that offer enhanced robustness and generalization superiorities.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications</p></details> |

However, unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are computationally infeasible because of the high energy barriers that separate these states. Although recent machine learning techniques are proposed to sample rare events, they are often limited to simple systems and rely on collective variables (CVs) derived from costly domain expertise. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that trains diffusion path samplers (DPS) to address the transition path sampling (TPS) problem without requiring CVs. We reformulate the problem as an amortized sampling from the transition path distribution by minimizing the log-variance divergence between the path distribution induced by DPS and the transition path distribution. Based on the log-variance divergence, we propose learnable control variates to reduce the variance of gradient estimators and the off-policy training objective with replay buffers and simulated annealing techniques to improve sample efficiency and diversity. We also propose a scale-based equivariant parameterization of the bias forces to ensure scalability for large systems. We extensively evaluate our approach, termed TPS-DPS, on a synthetic system, small peptide, and challenging fast-folding proteins, demonstrating that it produces more realistic and diverse transition pathways than existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel, problem-agnostic diffusion model called the maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based guided term estimation method for inverse problems. We divide the conditional score function into two terms according to Bayes' rule: the unconditional score function and the guided term. We design the MAP-based guided term estimation method, while the unconditional score function is approximated by an existing score network. To estimate the guided term, we base on the assumption that the space of clean natural images is inherently smooth, and introduce a MAP estimate of the $t$-th latent variable. We then substitute this estimation into the expression of the inverse problem and obtain the approximation of the guided term. We evaluate our method extensively on super-resolution, inpainting, and denoising tasks, and demonstrate comparable performance to DDRM, DMPS, DPS and $\Pi$GDM.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, constrained by the iterative denoising process that starts from pure noise, these methods are limited in both fidelity and efficiency. To address these two issues, we present Relay Residual Diffusion Extreme Image Compression (RDEIC), which leverages compressed feature initialization and residual diffusion. Specifically, we first use the compressed latent features of the image with added noise, instead of pure noise, as the starting point to eliminate the unnecessary initial stages of the denoising process. Second, we directly derive a novel residual diffusion equation from Stable Diffusion's original diffusion equation that reconstructs the raw image by iteratively removing the added noise and the residual between the compressed and target latent features. In this way, we effectively combine the efficiency of residual diffusion with the powerful generative capability of Stable Diffusion. Third, we propose a fixed-step fine-tuning strategy to eliminate the discrepancy between the training and inference phases, thereby further improving the reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RDEIC achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and outperforms existing diffusion-based extreme image compression methods in both fidelity and efficiency.

Existing approaches typically require monocular videos or calibrated multi-view images as inputs, whose applicability could be weakened in real-world scenarios with arbitrary and/or unknown camera poses. In this paper, we aim to generate the set of 3DGS attributes via a diffusion-based framework conditioned on human priors extracted from a single image. Specifically, we begin with carefully integrated human-centric feature extraction procedures to deduce informative conditioning signals. Based on our empirical observations that jointly learning the whole 3DGS attributes is challenging to optimize, we design a multi-stage generation strategy to obtain different types of 3DGS attributes. To facilitate the training process, we investigate constructing proxy ground-truth 3D Gaussian attributes as high-quality attribute-level supervision signals. Through extensive experiments, our HuGDiffusion shows significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, current research has primarily focused on adversarial attacks, with limited work exploring defense mechanisms. Furthermore, due to the spatial-temporal complexity of videos, existing video defense methods face issues of high cost, overfitting, and limited defense performance. Recently, diffusion-based adversarial purification methods have achieved robust defense performance in the image domain. However, due to the additional temporal dimension in videos, directly applying these diffusion-based adversarial purification methods to the video domain suffers performance and efficiency degradation. To achieve an efficient and effective video adversarial defense method, we propose the first diffusion-based video purification framework to improve video recognition models' adversarial robustness: VideoPure. Given an adversarial example, we first employ temporal DDIM inversion to transform the input distribution into a temporally consistent and trajectory-defined distribution, covering adversarial noise while preserving more video structure. Then, during DDIM denoising, we leverage intermediate results at each denoising step and conduct guided spatial-temporal optimization, removing adversarial noise while maintaining temporal consistency. Finally, we input the list of optimized intermediate results into the video recognition model for multi-step voting to obtain the predicted class. We investigate the defense performance of our method against black-box, gray-box, and adaptive attacks on benchmark datasets and models. Compared with other adversarial purification methods, our method overall demonstrates better defense performance against different attacks.

It generalizes Martingale optimal transport, and forms a hierarchy with the Hellinger and the Wasserstein metrics. We observe that certain classes of parabolic PDEs, among them the porous medium equation of exponent two, are formally semi-contractive metric gradient flows in the new distance. This observation is made rigorous for a suitable spatial discretization of the considered PDEs: these are semi-contractive gradient flows with respect to an adapted diffusive transport distance for measures on the point lattice. The main result is that the modulus of convexity is uniform with respect to the lattice spacing.

Existing works focus on the bottleneck layer (h-space) of Stable Diffusion's U-Net or leverage the cross-attention, self-attention, or decoding layers. Our model, SkipInject takes advantage of U-Net's skip connections. We conduct thorough analyses on the role of the skip connections and find that the residual connections passed by the third encoder block carry most of the spatial information of the reconstructed image, splitting the content from the style. We show that injecting the representations from this block can be used for text-based editing, precise modifications, and style transfer. We compare our methods state-of-the-art style transfer and image editing methods and demonstrate that our method obtains the best content alignment and optimal structural preservation tradeoff.</p></details> |  |

However, capturing the heterophily patterns and the multi-dimensional nature of user-item interactions poses significant challenges. To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information through intermediate and late-fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FWHDNN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and scalability in capturing high-order interconnections between users and items.</p></details> |  |

The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models.

Conventional methods for completing these partial point clouds rely on manually organized training sets and are usually limited to object categories seen during training. In this work, we propose a test-time framework for completing partial point clouds across unseen categories without any requirement for training. Leveraging point rendering via Gaussian Splatting, we develop techniques of Partial Gaussian Initialization, Zero-shot Fractal Completion, and Point Cloud Extraction that utilize priors from pre-trained 2D diffusion models to infer missing regions and extract uniform completed point clouds. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world scanned point clouds demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in completing a variety of objects.

However, like other AIGC types, video generation requires robust content control. A common approach is to embed watermarks, but most research has focused on images, with limited attention given to videos. Traditional methods, which embed watermarks frame-by-frame in a post-processing manner, often degrade video quality. In this paper, we propose VideoShield, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for popular diffusion-based video generation models. Unlike post-processing methods, VideoShield embeds watermarks directly during video generation, eliminating the need for additional training. To ensure video integrity, we introduce a tamper localization feature that can detect changes both temporally (across frames) and spatially (within individual frames). Our method maps watermark bits to template bits, which are then used to generate watermarked noise during the denoising process. Using DDIM Inversion, we can reverse the video to its original watermarked noise, enabling straightforward watermark extraction. Additionally, template bits allow precise detection for potential temporal and spatial modification. Extensive experiments across various video models (both T2V and I2V models) demonstrate that our method effectively extracts watermarks and detects tamper without compromising video quality. Furthermore, we show that this approach is applicable to image generation models, enabling tamper detection in generated images as well.

We propose a three-stage image reconstruction method for the simultaneous recovery of the absorption, diffusion, and Gr\"uneisen coefficients. We demonstrate, through numerical simulations, that: (i) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is known, the addition of the optical measurements allows a more accurate reconstruction of the scattering and absorption coefficients; and (ii) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is not known, the addition of optical current measurements allows us to reconstruct uniquely the Gr\"uneisen, the scattering and absorption coefficients. Numerical simulations based on synthetic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea.</p></details> |  |

One approach, unfolding, statistically adjusts the experimental data for detector effects. Recently, generative machine learning models have shown promise for performing unbinned unfolding in a high number of dimensions. However, all current generative approaches are limited to unfolding a fixed set of observables, making them unable to perform full-event unfolding in the variable dimensional environment of collider data. A novel modification to the variational latent diffusion model (VLD) approach to generative unfolding is presented, which allows for unfolding of high- and variable-dimensional feature spaces. The performance of this method is evaluated in the context of semi-leptonic top quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission to SciPost</p></details> |

However, precise control over image attributes remains challenging, especially at the instance level. While existing methods offer some control through fine-tuning or auxiliary information, they often face limitations in flexibility and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), open-vocabulary detectors, cross-attention maps and intermediate activations of diffusion U-Net for instance-level image manipulation. Our method detects objects mentioned in the prompt and present in the generated image, enabling precise manipulation without extensive training or input masks. By incorporating cross-attention maps, our approach ensures coherence in manipulated images while controlling object positions.

| **[Binary Diffusion Probabilistic Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13915v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Binary Diffusion Probabilistic Model (BDPM), a novel generative model optimized for binary data representations. While denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated notable success in tasks like image synthesis and restoration, traditional DDPMs rely on continuous data representations and mean squared error (MSE) loss for training, applying Gaussian noise models that may not be optimal for discrete or binary data structures. BDPM addresses this by decomposing images into bitplanes and employing XOR-based noise transformations, with a denoising model trained using binary cross-entropy loss. This approach enables precise noise control and computationally efficient inference, significantly lowering computational costs and improving model convergence. When evaluated on image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, inpainting, and blind image restoration, BDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ datasets. Notably, BDPM requires fewer inference steps than traditional DDPM models to reach optimal results, showcasing enhanced inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[INDIGO+: A Unified INN-Guided Probabilistic Diffusion Algorithm for Blind and Non-Blind Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14014v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models are becoming one of the most popular prior in image restoration (IR) tasks due to their remarkable ability to generate realistic natural images. Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |
| **[Accelerate High-Quality Diffusion Models with Inner Loop Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13107v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Inner Loop Feedback (ILF), a novel approach to accelerate diffusion models' inference. ILF trains a lightweight module to predict future features in the denoising process by leveraging the outputs from a chosen diffusion backbone block at a given time step. This approach exploits two key intuitions; (1) the outputs of a given block at adjacent time steps are similar, and (2) performing partial computations for a step imposes a lower burden on the model than skipping the step entirely. Our method is highly flexible, since we find that the feedback module itself can simply be a block from the diffusion backbone, with all settings copied. Its influence on the diffusion forward can be tempered with a learnable scaling factor from zero initialization. We train this module using distillation losses; however, unlike some prior work where a full diffusion backbone serves as the student, our model freezes the backbone, training only the feedback module. While many efforts to optimize diffusion models focus on achieving acceptable image quality in extremely few steps (1-4 steps), our emphasis is on matching best case results (typically achieved in 20 steps) while significantly reducing runtime. ILF achieves this balance effectively, demonstrating strong performance for both class-to-image generation with diffusion transformer (DiT) and text-to-image generation with DiT-based PixArt-alpha and PixArt-sigma. The quality of ILF's 1.7x-1.8x speedups are confirmed by FID, CLIP score, CLIP Image Quality Assessment, ImageReward, and qualitative comparisons.

| **[Efficient Domain Augmentation for Autonomous Driving Testing Using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13661v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing is widely used to assess the reliability of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), but its effectiveness is limited by the operational design domain (ODD) conditions available in such simulators. To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then perform system-level testing to evaluate the ADS's generalization ability to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help increase the ODD coverage for system-level testing of ADS. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3%, retaining the correctness and quality of the generated images for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Shallow Ritz Method For 1D Diffusion Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17750v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the shallow Ritz method for solving the one-dimensional diffusion problem. It is shown that the shallow Ritz method improves the order of approximation dramatically for non-smooth problems. To realize this optimal or nearly optimal order of the shallow Ritz approximation, we develop a damped block Newton (dBN) method that alternates between updates of the linear and non-linear parameters. Per each iteration, the linear and the non-linear parameters are updated by exact inversion and one step of a modified, damped Newton method applied to a reduced non-linear system, respectively. The computational cost of each dBN iteration is $O(n)$. Starting with the non-linear parameters as a uniform partition of the interval, numerical experiments show that the dBN is capable of efficiently moving mesh points to nearly optimal locations. To improve efficiency of the dBN further, we propose an adaptive damped block Newton (AdBN) method by combining the dBN with the adaptive neuron enhancement (ANE) method [26].</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling the Power of Noise Priors: Enhancing Diffusion Models for Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13794v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of mobile traffic, \textit{i.e.,} network traffic from cellular base stations, is crucial for optimizing network performance and supporting urban development. However, the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both regular patterns and abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing such complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent uncertainties. Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising networks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the role of noise in the denoising process. Our analysis reveals that noise fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions, exhibiting distinct and consistent patterns. We propose NPDiff, a framework that decomposes noise into \textit{prior} and \textit{residual} components, with the \textit{prior} derived from data dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations. NPDiff can seamlessly integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models, delivering predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an improvement over 30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion models in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Diffusion-based Non-Autoregressive Solver for Traveling Salesman Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13767v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in neural models have shown considerable promise in solving Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs) without relying on much hand-crafted engineering. However, while non-autoregressive (NAR) approaches benefit from faster inference through parallelism, they typically deliver solutions of inferior quality compared to autoregressive ones. To enhance the solution quality while maintaining fast inference, we propose DEITSP, a diffusion model with efficient iterations tailored for TSP that operates in a NAR manner. Firstly, we introduce a one-step diffusion model that integrates the controlled discrete noise addition process with self-consistency enhancement, enabling optimal solution prediction through simultaneous denoising of multiple solutions. Secondly, we design a dual-modality graph transformer to bolster the extraction and fusion of features from node and edge modalities, while further accelerating the inference with fewer layers. Thirdly, we develop an efficient iterative strategy that alternates between adding and removing noise to improve exploration compared to previous diffusion methods. Additionally, we devise a scheduling framework to progressively refine the solution space by adjusting noise levels, facilitating a smooth search for optimal solutions. Extensive experiments on real-world and large-scale TSP instances demonstrate that DEITSP performs favorably against existing neural approaches in terms of solution quality, inference latency, and generalization ability.

Current decentralized learning paradigms typically rely on an averaging mechanism to encourage agreement in the parameter space. We argue that in the context of deep neural networks, which are often over-parameterized, encouraging consensus of the neural network outputs, as opposed to their parameters can be more appropriate. This motivates the development of a new decentralized learning algorithm, termed DRT diffusion, based on deep relative trust (DRT), a recently introduced similarity measure for neural networks. We provide convergence analysis for the proposed strategy, and numerically establish its benefit to generalization, especially with sparse topologies, in an image classification task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Perceptual Neural Video Compression with Temporal Diffusion Information Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13528v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, foundational diffusion models have attracted considerable attention in image compression tasks, whereas their application to video compression remains largely unexplored. In this article, we introduce DiffVC, a diffusion-based perceptual neural video compression framework that effectively integrates foundational diffusion model with the video conditional coding paradigm. This framework uses temporal context from previously decoded frame and the reconstructed latent representation of the current frame to guide the diffusion model in generating high-quality results. To accelerate the iterative inference process of diffusion model, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Information Reuse (TDIR) strategy, which significantly enhances inference efficiency with minimal performance loss by reusing the diffusion information from previous frames. Additionally, to address the challenges posed by distortion differences across various bitrates, we propose the Quantization Parameter-based Prompting (QPP) mechanism, which utilizes quantization parameters as prompts fed into the foundational diffusion model to explicitly modulate intermediate features, thereby enabling a robust variable bitrate diffusion-based neural compression framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution delivers excellent performance in both perception metrics and visual quality.</p></details> |  |

However, these compromises fail to meet clinical demands for both efficiency and precision. Consequently, denoising is a vital preprocessing step, particularly for dMRI, where clean data is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce Di-Fusion, a fully self-supervised denoising method that leverages the latter diffusion steps and an adaptive sampling process. Unlike previous approaches, our single-stage framework achieves efficient and stable training without extra noise model training and offers adaptive and controllable results in the sampling process. Our thorough experiments on real and simulated data demonstrate that Di-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in microstructure modeling, tractography tracking, and other downstream tasks.</p></details> | 39pages, 34figures |

To address this, we propose MultiDreamer3D that can generate coherent multi-concept 3D content in a divide-and-conquer manner. First, we generate 3D bounding boxes using an LLM-based layout controller. Next, a selective point cloud generator creates coarse point clouds for each concept. These point clouds are placed in the 3D bounding boxes and initialized into 3D Gaussian Splatting with concept labels, enabling precise identification of concept attributions in 2D projections. Finally, we refine 3D Gaussians via concept-aware interval score matching, guided by concept-aware diffusion. Our experimental results show that MultiDreamer3D not only ensures object presence and preserves the distinct identities of each concept but also successfully handles complex cases such as property change or interaction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the multi-concept customization in 3D.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) is an alternative approach that aims to identify any anomaly as an outlier from a healthy training distribution. A prevalent strategy for UAD in brain MRI involves using generative models to learn the reconstruction of healthy brain anatomy for a given input image. As these models should fail to reconstruct unhealthy structures, the reconstruction errors indicate anomalies. However, a significant challenge is to balance the accurate reconstruction of healthy anatomy and the undesired replication of abnormal structures. While diffusion models have shown promising results with detailed and accurate reconstructions, they face challenges in preserving intensity characteristics, resulting in false positives. We propose conditioning the denoising process of diffusion models with additional information derived from a latent representation of the input image. We demonstrate that this conditioning allows for accurate and local adaptation to the general input intensity distribution while avoiding the replication of unhealthy structures. We compare the novel approach to different state-of-the-art methods and for different data sets. Our results show substantial improvements in the segmentation performance, with the Dice score improved by 11.9%, 20.0%, and 44.6%, for the BraTS, ATLAS and MSLUB data sets, respectively, while maintaining competitive performance on the WMH data set. Furthermore, our results indicate effective domain adaptation across different MRI acquisitions and simulated contrasts, an important attribute for general anomaly detection methods.

| **[Polyhedra Encoding Transformers: Enhancing Diffusion MRI Analysis Beyond Voxel and Volumetric Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13352v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is an essential tool in neuroimaging. It is arguably the sole noninvasive technique for examining the microstructural properties and structural connectivity of the brain. Recent years have seen the emergence of machine learning and data-driven approaches that enhance the speed, accuracy, and consistency of dMRI data analysis. However, traditional deep learning models often fell short, as they typically utilize pixel-level or volumetric patch-level embeddings similar to those used in structural MRI, and do not account for the unique distribution of various gradient encodings. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Polyhedra Encoding Transformer (PE-Transformer) for dMRI, designed specifically to handle spherical signals. Our approach involves projecting an icosahedral polygon onto a unit sphere to resample signals from predetermined directions. These resampled signals are then transformed into embeddings, which are processed by a transformer encoder that incorporates orientational information reflective of the icosahedral structure. Through experimental validation with various gradient encoding protocols, our method demonstrates superior accuracy in estimating multi-compartment models and Fiber Orientation Distributions (FOD), outperforming both conventional CNN architectures and standard transformers.</p></details> |  |

| **[MSF: Efficient Diffusion Model Via Multi-Scale Latent Factorize](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13349v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable progress in visual content generation. However, traditional diffusion models directly denoise the entire image from noisy inputs, disregarding the hierarchical structure present in visual signals. This method is computationally intensive, especially for high-resolution image generation. Signal processing often leverages hierarchical decompositions; for instance, Fourier analysis decomposes signals by frequency, while wavelet analysis captures localized frequency components, reflecting both spatial and frequency information simultaneously. Inspired by these principles, we propose a multiscale diffusion framework that generates hierarchical visual representations, which are subsequently integrated to form the final output. The diffusion model target, whether raw RGB pixels or latent features from a Variational Autoencoder, s divided into multiple components that each capture distinct spatial levels. The low-resolution component contains the primary informative signal, while higher-resolution components add high-frequency details, such as texture. This approach divides image generation into two stages: producing a low-resolution base signal, followed by a high-resolution residual signal. Both stages can be effectively modeled using simpler, lightweight transformer architectures compared to full-resolution generation. This decomposition is conceptually similar to wavelet decomposition but offers a more streamlined and intuitive design. Our method, termed MSF(short for Multi-Scale Factorization), achieves an FID of 2.2 and an IS of 255.4 on the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, reducing computational costs by 50% compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Fits All: General Mobility Trajectory Modeling via Masked Conditional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13347v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data play a crucial role in many applications, ranging from network optimization to urban planning. Existing studies on trajectory data are task-specific, and their applicability is limited to the specific tasks on which they have been trained, such as generation, recovery, or prediction. However, the potential of a unified model has not yet been fully explored in trajectory modeling. Although various trajectory tasks differ in inputs, outputs, objectives, and conditions, they share common mobility patterns. Based on these common patterns, we can construct a general framework that enables a single model to address different tasks. However, building a trajectory task-general framework faces two critical challenges: 1) the diversity in the formats of different tasks and 2) the complexity of the conditions imposed on different tasks. In this work, we propose a general trajectory modeling framework via masked conditional diffusion (named GenMove). Specifically, we utilize mask conditions to unify diverse formats. To adapt to complex conditions associated with different tasks, we utilize historical trajectory data to obtain contextual trajectory embeddings, which include rich contexts such as spatiotemporal characteristics and user preferences. Integrating the contextual trajectory embedding into diffusion models through a classifier-free guidance approach allows the model to flexibly adjust its outputs based on different conditions. Extensive experiments on mainstream tasks demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with the highest performance improvement exceeding 13% in generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

By incorporating rich knowledge from an auxiliary database, RAG enhances diffusion models' generation and generalization ability while significantly reducing model parameters. Despite the great success, RAG may introduce novel security issues that warrant further investigation. In this paper, we reveal that the RDM is susceptible to backdoor attacks by proposing a multimodal contrastive attack approach named BadRDM. Our framework fully considers RAG's characteristics and is devised to manipulate the retrieved items for given text triggers, thereby further controlling the generated contents. Specifically, we first insert a tiny portion of images into the retrieval database as target toxicity surrogates. Subsequently, a malicious variant of contrastive learning is adopted to inject backdoors into the retriever, which builds shortcuts from triggers to the toxicity surrogates. Furthermore, we enhance the attacks through novel entropy-based selection and generative augmentation strategies that can derive better toxicity surrogates. Extensive experiments on two mainstream tasks demonstrate the proposed BadRDM achieves outstanding attack effects while preserving the model's benign utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Diffusion Guidance via Learning Degradation-Aware Models for Blind Super Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08819v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based blind super-resolution (SR) methods have shown great ability to generate high-resolution images with abundant high-frequency detail, but the detail is often achieved at the expense of fidelity. Meanwhile, another line of research focusing on rectifying the reverse process of diffusion models (i.e., diffusion guidance), has demonstrated the power to generate high-fidelity results for non-blind SR. However, these methods rely on known degradation kernels, making them difficult to apply to blind SR. To address these issues, we present DADiff in this paper. DADiff incorporates degradation-aware models into the diffusion guidance framework, eliminating the need to know degradation kernels. Additionally, we propose two novel techniques: input perturbation and guidance scalar, to further improve our performance. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method has superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on blind SR benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in WACV 2025.

In this work, we enhance video diffusion models by allowing motion control via structured latent noise sampling. This is achieved by just a change in data: we pre-process training videos to yield structured noise. Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, making it a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusion models.

| **[Dequantization and Color Transfer with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02698v5)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate an image dequantizing diffusion model that enables novel edits on natural images. We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025 23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[State Combinatorial Generalization In Decision Making With Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13241v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world decision-making problems are combinatorial in nature, where states (e.g., surrounding traffic of a self-driving car) can be seen as a combination of basic elements (e.g., pedestrians, trees, and other cars). Due to combinatorial complexity, observing all combinations of basic elements in the training set is infeasible, which leads to an essential yet understudied problem of zero-shot generalization to states that are unseen combinations of previously seen elements. In this work, we first formalize this problem and then demonstrate how existing value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle due to unreliable value predictions in unseen states. We argue that this problem cannot be addressed with exploration alone, but requires more expressive and generalizable models. We demonstrate that behavior cloning with a conditioned diffusion model trained on expert trajectory generalizes better to states formed by new combinations of seen elements than traditional RL methods. Through experiments in maze, driving, and multiagent environments, we show that conditioned diffusion models outperform traditional RL techniques and highlight the broad applicability of our problem formulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orchid: Image Latent Diffusion for Joint Appearance and Geometry Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13087v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are state-of-the-art for image generation. Trained on large datasets, they capture expressive image priors that have been used for tasks like inpainting, depth, and (surface) normal prediction. However, these models are typically trained for one specific task, e.g., a separate model for each of color, depth, and normal prediction. Such models do not leverage the intrinsic correlation between appearance and geometry, often leading to inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose using a novel image diffusion prior that jointly encodes appearance and geometry. We introduce a diffusion model Orchid, comprising a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode color, depth, and surface normals to a latent space, and a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for generating these joint latents. Orchid directly generates photo-realistic color images, relative depth, and surface normals from user-provided text, and can be used to create image-aligned partial 3D scenes seamlessly. It can also perform image-conditioned tasks like joint monocular depth and normal prediction and is competitive in accuracy to state-of-the-art methods designed for those tasks alone. Lastly, our model learns a joint prior that can be used zero-shot as a regularizer for many inverse problems that entangle appearance and geometry. For example, we demonstrate its effectiveness in color-depth-normal inpainting, showcasing its applicability to problems in 3D generation from sparse views.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://orchid3d.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Beyond the Lungs: Extending the Field of View in Chest CT with Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13068v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interconnection between the human lungs and other organs, such as the liver and kidneys, is crucial for understanding the underlying risks and effects of lung diseases and improving patient care. However, most research chest CT imaging is focused solely on the lungs due to considerations of cost and radiation dose. This restricted field of view (FOV) in the acquired images poses challenges to comprehensive analysis and hinders the ability to gain insights into the impact of lung diseases on other organs. To address this, we propose SCOPE (Spatial Coverage Optimization with Prior Encoding), a novel approach to capture the inter-organ relationships from CT images and extend the FOV of chest CT images. Our approach first trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode 2D axial CT slices individually, then stacks the latent representations of the VAE to form a 3D context for training a latent diffusion model. Once trained, our approach extends the FOV of CT images in the z-direction by generating new axial slices in a zero-shot manner. We evaluated our approach on the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset, and results suggest that it effectively extends the FOV to include the liver and kidneys, which are not completely covered in the original NLST data acquisition. Quantitative results on a held-out whole-body dataset demonstrate that the generated slices exhibit high fidelity with acquired data, achieving an SSIM of 0.81.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Framework for Crediting Data Contributors of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03153v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As diffusion models are deployed in real-world settings, and their performance is driven by training data, appraising the contribution of data contributors is crucial to creating incentives for sharing quality data and to implementing policies for data compensation. Depending on the use case, model performance corresponds to various global properties of the distribution learned by a diffusion model (e.g., overall aesthetic quality). Hence, here we address the problem of attributing global properties of diffusion models to data contributors. The Shapley value provides a principled approach to valuation by uniquely satisfying game-theoretic axioms of fairness. However, estimating Shapley values for diffusion models is computationally impractical because it requires retraining on many training data subsets corresponding to different contributors and rerunning inference. We introduce a method to efficiently retrain and rerun inference for Shapley value estimation, by leveraging model pruning and fine-tuning. We evaluate the utility of our method with three use cases: (i) image quality for a DDPM trained on a CIFAR dataset, (ii) demographic diversity for an LDM trained on CelebA-HQ, and (iii) aesthetic quality for a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on Post-Impressionist artworks. Our results empirically demonstrate that our framework can identify important data contributors across models' global properties, outperforming existing attribution methods for diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
