| **[NarrLV: Towards a Comprehensive Narrative-Centric Evaluation for Long Video Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11245v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://amap-ml.github.io/NarrLV-Website/</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08438v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in visual domains such as image and video generation. They have also recently emerged as a promising approach in robotics, especially in robot manipulations. Diffusion models leverage a probabilistic framework, and they stand out with their ability to model multi-modal distributions and their robustness to high-dimensional input and output spaces. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art diffusion models in robotic manipulation, including grasp learning, trajectory planning, and data augmentation. Diffusion models for scene and image augmentation lie at the intersection of robotics and computer vision for vision-based tasks to enhance generalizability and data scarcity. This paper also presents the two main frameworks of diffusion models and their integration with imitation learning and reinforcement learning. In addition, it discusses the common architectures and benchmarks and points out the challenges and advantages of current state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 2 figure, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[M2DAO-Talker: Harmonizing Multi-granular Motion Decoupling and Alternating Optimization for Talking-head Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08307v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur, temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization. Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy. Meanwhile, a motion consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS inference speed.

| **[MG-Gen: Single Image to Motion Graphics Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02361v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MG-Gen, a framework that generates motion graphics directly from a single raster image. MG-Gen decompose a single raster image into layered structures represented as HTML, generate animation scripts for each layer, and then render them into a video. Experiments confirm MG-Gen generates dynamic motion graphics while preserving text readability and fidelity to the input conditions, whereas state-of-the-art image-to-video generation methods struggle with them. The code is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/MG-GEN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Democratizing High-Fidelity Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06812v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic, audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image, predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while generalizing across speakers and contexts. Code, models, and CSG-405 are publicly released at https://mpi-lab.github.io/Democratizing-CSG/</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[HANDI: Hand-Centric Text-and-Image Conditioned Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04189v5)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent strides in video generation, state-of-the-art methods still struggle with elements of visual detail. One particularly challenging case is the class of videos in which the intricate motion of the hand coupled with a mostly stable and otherwise distracting environment is necessary to convey the execution of some complex action and its effects. To address these challenges, we introduce a new method for video generation that focuses on hand-centric actions. Our diffusion-based method incorporates two distinct innovations. First, we propose an automatic method to generate the motion area -- the region in the video in which the detailed activities occur -- guided by both the visual context and the action text prompt, rather than assuming this region can be provided manually as is now commonplace. Second, we introduce a critical Hand Refinement Loss to guide the diffusion model to focus on smooth and consistent hand poses. We evaluate our method on challenging augmented datasets based on EpicKitchens and Ego4D, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of action clarity, especially of the hand motion in the target region, across diverse environments and actions.

| **[Flows and Diffusions on the Neural Manifold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10623v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several trajectory inference techniques under the framework of gradient flow matching, providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts, where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[RealCam-I2V: Real-World Image-to-Video Generation with Interactive Complex Camera Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10059v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in camera-trajectory-guided image-to-video generation offer higher precision and better support for complex camera control compared to text-based approaches. However, they also introduce significant usability challenges, as users often struggle to provide precise camera parameters when working with arbitrary real-world images without knowledge of their depth nor scene scale. To address these real-world application issues, we propose RealCam-I2V, a novel diffusion-based video generation framework that integrates monocular metric depth estimation to establish 3D scene reconstruction in a preprocessing step. During training, the reconstructed 3D scene enables scaling camera parameters from relative to metric scales, ensuring compatibility and scale consistency across diverse real-world images. In inference, RealCam-I2V offers an intuitive interface where users can precisely draw camera trajectories by dragging within the 3D scene. To further enhance precise camera control and scene consistency, we propose scene-constrained noise shaping, which shapes high-level noise and also allows the framework to maintain dynamic and coherent video generation in lower noise stages. RealCam-I2V achieves significant improvements in controllability and video quality on the RealEstate10K and out-of-domain images. We further enables applications like camera-controlled looping video generation and generative frame interpolation.

| **[DH-FaceVid-1K: A Large-Scale High-Quality Dataset for Face Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07151v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-centric generative models are becoming increasingly popular, giving rise to various innovative tools and applications, such as talking face videos conditioned on text or audio prompts. The core of these capabilities lies in powerful pre-trained foundation models, trained on large-scale, high-quality datasets. However, many advanced methods rely on in-house data subject to various constraints, and other current studies fail to generate high-resolution face videos, which is mainly attributed to the significant lack of large-scale, high-quality face video datasets. In this paper, we introduce a human face video dataset, \textbf{DH-FaceVid-1K}. Our collection spans 1,200 hours in total, encompassing 270,043 video clips from over 20,000 individuals. Each sample includes corresponding speech audio, facial keypoints, and text annotations. Compared to other publicly available datasets, ours distinguishes itself through its multi-ethnic coverage and high-quality, comprehensive individual attributes. We establish multiple face video generation models supporting tasks such as text-to-video and image-to-video generation. In addition, we develop comprehensive benchmarks to validate the scaling law when using different proportions of proposed dataset. Our primary aim is to contribute a face video dataset, particularly addressing the underrepresentation of Asian faces in existing curated datasets and thereby enriching the global spectrum of face-centric data and mitigating demographic biases. \textbf{Project Page:} https://luna-ai-lab.github.io/DH-FaceVid-1K/</p></details> |  |
| **[An Introduction to Flow Matching and Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02070v2)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion and flow-based models have become the state of the art for generative AI across a wide range of data modalities, including images, videos, shapes, molecules, music, and more. This tutorial provides a self-contained introduction to diffusion and flow-based generative models from first principles. We systematically develop the necessary mathematical background in ordinary and stochastic differential equations and derive the core algorithms of flow matching and denoising diffusion models. We then provide a step-by-step guide to building image and video generators, including training methods, guidance, and architectural design. This tutorial is ideal for machine learning researchers who want to develop a principled understanding of the theory and practice of generative AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Many-for-Many: Unify the Training of Multiple Video and Image Generation and Manipulation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01758v2)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many visual generation and manipulation tasks. Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines. Our models and source codes are available at https://github.com/leeruibin/MfM.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ophora: A Large-Scale Data-Driven Text-Guided Ophthalmic Surgical Video Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07449v7)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding.

| **[$I^{2}$-World: Intra-Inter Tokenization for Efficient Dynamic 4D Scene Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09144v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose $I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that $I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is available on https://github.com/lzzzzzm/II-World.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming generative video models for zero-shot optical flow extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09082v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem. Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm, which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture. Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://neuroailab.github.io/projects/kl_tracing</p></details> |
| **[Lumos-1: On Autoregressive Video Generation from a Unified Model Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08801v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality. Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

| **[X-Dancer: Expressive Music to Human Dance Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17414v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present X-Dancer, a novel zero-shot music-driven image animation pipeline that creates diverse and long-range lifelike human dance videos from a single static image. As its core, we introduce a unified transformer-diffusion framework, featuring an autoregressive transformer model that synthesize extended and music-synchronized token sequences for 2D body, head and hands poses, which then guide a diffusion model to produce coherent and realistic dance video frames. Unlike traditional methods that primarily generate human motion in 3D, X-Dancer addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by modeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, capturing their nuanced alignment with musical beats through readily available monocular videos. To achieve this, we first build a spatially compositional token representation from 2D human pose labels associated with keypoint confidences, encoding both large articulated body movements (e.g., upper and lower body) and fine-grained motions (e.g., head and hands). We then design a music-to-motion transformer model that autoregressively generates music-aligned dance pose token sequences, incorporating global attention to both musical style and prior motion context. Finally we leverage a diffusion backbone to animate the reference image with these synthesized pose tokens through AdaIN, forming a fully differentiable end-to-end framework. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Dancer is able to produce both diverse and characterized dance videos, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods in term of diversity, expressiveness and realism. Code and model will be available for research purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025. Project Page: https://zeyuan-chen.com/X-Dancer/</p></details> |

Today, such deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Upsample What Matters: Region-Adaptive Latent Sampling for Accelerated Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08422v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometry Forcing: Marrying Video Diffusion and 3D Representation for Consistent World Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07982v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However, our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods.

However, this task poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data, synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally, camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://marsgenai.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Scaling RL to Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models.

Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we present several challenging future research directions which may contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Similar results have previously been achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://v-mem.github.io</p></details> |

Current methods require multi-view videos for fluid reconstruction. We present FluidNexus, a novel framework that bridges video generation and physics simulation to tackle this task. Our key insight is to synthesize multiple novel-view videos as references for reconstruction. FluidNexus consists of two key components: (1) a novel-view video synthesizer that combines frame-wise view synthesis with video diffusion refinement for generating realistic videos, and (2) a physics-integrated particle representation coupling differentiable simulation and rendering to simultaneously facilitate 3D fluid reconstruction and prediction. To evaluate our approach, we collect two new real-world fluid datasets featuring textured backgrounds and object interactions. Our method enables dynamic novel view synthesis, future prediction, and interaction simulation from a single fluid video.

Furthermore, videos exceeding 16 seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their architectural designs and performance characteristics.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their popularity, these models rely on user-provided text and image prompts, and there is currently no dedicated dataset for studying these prompts. In this paper, we introduce TIP-I2V, the first large-scale dataset of over 1.70 million unique user-provided Text and Image Prompts specifically for Image-to-Video generation. Additionally, we provide the corresponding generated videos from five state-of-the-art image-to-video models. We begin by outlining the time-consuming and costly process of curating this large-scale dataset. Next, we compare TIP-I2V to two popular prompt datasets, VidProM (text-to-video) and DiffusionDB (text-to-image), highlighting differences in both basic and semantic information. This dataset enables advancements in image-to-video research. For instance, to develop better models, researchers can use the prompts in TIP-I2V to analyze user preferences and evaluate the multi-dimensional performance of their trained models; and to enhance model safety, they may focus on addressing the misinformation issue caused by image-to-video models. The new research inspired by TIP-I2V and the differences with existing datasets emphasize the importance of a specialized image-to-video prompt dataset.

Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore, automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation. Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color consistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

| **[Physics-Grounded Motion Forecasting via Equation Discovery for Trajectory-Guided Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06830v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions, our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, project page: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/OmniVideo_project/</p></details> |
| **[PromptTea: Let Prompts Tell TeaCache the Optimal Threshold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06739v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues, PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example, 2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across a range of scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, altering camera trajectories of a given video remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation. It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories. The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video conditioning mechanism--its capability is often overlooked in current research. To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5, which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics, covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our method also finds promising applications in video stabilization, super-resolution, and outpainting.

In this paper, we present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

However, they often suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in both text and video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Stabilized and Efficient Diffusion Transformers through Long-Skip-Connections with Spectral Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17616v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high fidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish Long-Skip-Connections as critical architectural components for stable and efficient diffusion transformers.

Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios, providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further research in medical video generation.

Synthesizing sustained footage (e.g. over minutes) still remains an open research question. In this paper, we propose MALT Diffusion (using Memory-Augmented Latent Transformers), a new diffusion model specialized for long video generation. MALT Diffusion (or just MALT) handles long videos by subdividing them into short segments and doing segment-level autoregressive generation. To achieve this, we first propose recurrent attention layers that encode multiple segments into a compact memory latent vector; by maintaining this memory vector over time, MALT is able to condition on it and continuously generate new footage based on a long temporal context. We also present several training techniques that enable the model to generate frames over a long horizon with consistent quality and minimal degradation. We validate the effectiveness of MALT through experiments on long video benchmarks. We first perform extensive analysis of MALT in long-contextual understanding capability and stability using popular long video benchmarks. For example, MALT achieves an FVD score of 220.4 on 128-frame video generation on UCF-101, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of 648.4. Finally, we explore MALT's capabilities in a text-to-video generation setting and show that it can produce long videos compared with recent techniques for long text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop on AI for Content Creation (Oral)</p></details> |

However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in our project website: https://cumulo-autumn.github.io/StreamDiT/</p></details> |  |

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |

However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that generates both audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. By using a unified denoising network, UniForm captures the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Additionally, we propose task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling the model to support multiple tasks with a single set of parameters, including video-to-audio, audio-to-video and text-to-audio-video generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Experiments show that UniForm achieves performance close to the state-of-the-art single-task models across three generation tasks, with generated content that is not only highly aligned with real-world data distributions but also enables more diverse and fine-grained generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our demos are available at https://uniform-t2av.github.io/</p></details> |

However, existing methods often generate only a single dominant color, missing emotion variation. Others rely on indirect mappings through text or images, resulting in the loss of crucial emotion details. To address these challenges, we present Music2Palette, a novel method for emotion-aligned color palette generation via cross-modal representation learning. We first construct MuCED, a dataset of 2,634 expert-validated music-palette pairs aligned through Russell-based emotion vectors. To directly translate music into palettes, we propose a cross-modal representation learning framework with a music encoder and color decoder. We further propose a multi-objective optimization approach that jointly enhances emotion alignment, color diversity, and palette coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current methods in interpreting music emotion and generating attractive and diverse color palettes. Our approach enables applications like music-driven image recoloring, video generating, and data visualization, bridging the gap between auditory and visual emotion experiences.</p></details> |  |

However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.</p></details> |  |

We address these issues to enhance the consistency and coherence of videos generated with either single or multiple prompts. We propose the Time-frequency based temporal Attention Reweighting Algorithm (TiARA), which judiciously edits the attention score matrix based on the Discrete Short-Time Fourier Transform. This method is supported by a frequency-based analysis, ensuring that the edited attention score matrix achieves improved consistency across frames. It represents the first-of-its-kind for frequency-based methods in video diffusion models. For videos generated by multiple prompts, we further uncover key factors such as the alignment of the prompts affecting prompt interpolation quality. Inspired by our analyses, we propose PromptBlend, an advanced prompt interpolation pipeline that systematically aligns the prompts. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating consistent and substantial improvements over multiple baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Building Physically Plausible World Models (Best Paper), 32 pages, 17 figures</p></details> |

Our approach integrates key concepts from Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs), enforcing a k-Lipschitz continuity constraint on the discriminator to stabilize training and enhance convergence. We further leverage Conditional GAN (cGAN) techniques by incorporating class labels during both training and inference, enabling class-specific video generation with improved semantic consistency. We provide a detailed layer-wise description of the Generator and Discriminator networks, highlighting architectural design choices promoting temporal coherence and spatial detail. The overall combined architecture, training algorithm, and optimization strategy are thoroughly presented. Our training objective combines a pixel-wise mean squared error loss with an adversarial loss to balance frame-level accuracy and video realism. We validate our approach on benchmark datasets including UCF101, Golf, and Aeroplane, encompassing diverse motion patterns and scene contexts. Quantitative evaluations using Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art unsupervised video generation methods in terms of both quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |

Processing these videos generates valuable assets for training sophisticated models. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-RL, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training model tailored for semantic segmentation for surgical scenes. CLIP-RL presents a new segmentation approach which involves reinforcement learning and curriculum learning, enabling continuous refinement of the segmentation masks during the full training pipeline. Our model has shown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions, texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges. CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic context that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL module plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through iterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018 and EndoVis 2017 datasets. CLIP-RL achieved a mean IoU of 81%, outperforming state-of-the-art models, and a mean IoU of 74.12% on EndoVis 2017. This superior performance was achieved due to the combination of contrastive learning with reinforcement learning and curriculum learning.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches are limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames, generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible presentation formats.

However, the slow inference speed and high computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this, we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient, high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating videos in a wide range of scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nextframed.github.io/</p></details> |

As a result, there are also growing concerns about the potential misuse of video generation for spreading illegal content and misinformation. In this work, we introduce VGMShield: a set of straightforward but effective mitigations through the lifecycle of fake video generation. We start from fake video detection, trying to understand whether there is uniqueness in generated videos and whether we can differentiate them from real videos; then, we investigate the fake video source tracing problem, which maps a fake video back to the model that generated it. Towards these, we propose to leverage pre-trained models that focus on spatial-temporal dynamics as the backbone to identify inconsistencies in videos. In detail, we analyze fake videos from the perspective of the generation process. Based on the observation of attention shifts, motion variations, and frequency fluctuations, we identify common patterns in the generated video. These patterns serve as the foundation for our experiments on fake video detection and source tracing. Through experiments on seven state-of-the-art open-source models, we demonstrate that current models still cannot reliably reproduce spatial-temporal relationships, and thus, we can accomplish detection and source tracing with over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, anticipating future generative model improvements, we propose a prevention method that adds invisible perturbations to the query images to make the generated videos look unreal. Together with detection and tracing, our multi-faceted set of solutions can effectively mitigate misuse of video generative models.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600, UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters, across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference. Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling, pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora, Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance, reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36% PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video generation in both research and practical applications.

However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content. Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video generation.

In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</p></details> |  |

We innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD), which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos. Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex, robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA models. Our RGCD is publicly available at: https://github.com/IntMeGroup/RGC-VQA.</p></details> |  |

Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, potentially limiting their applications. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which improves the image quality by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. SG only relies on the sampling probabilities of its own diffusion model at different noise levels with no need of any guidance-specific training. This makes it flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms. We also introduce a more efficient approximation of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid doubling sampling time. We conduct experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG with only one forward pass. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability of eliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We will release our code along with this paper.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Models for Language Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07050v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution, followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation. Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed. Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of 4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting future work in non-autoregressive language generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>pdfLa...</summary><p>pdfLaTeX, 69 pages with 21 figures, Licentiate Thesis</p></details> |

Current research on video generation suggests a promising avenue for controllable film creation in pixel space using Diffusion models. However, the reliance on overly verbose prompts and insufficient focus on cinematic elements (e.g., camera movement) results in videos that lack cinematic quality. Furthermore, the absence of 3D modeling often leads to failures in video generation, such as inconsistent character models at different frames, ultimately hindering the immersive experience for viewers. In this paper, we propose a new framework for film creation, Dream-Cinema, which is designed for user-friendly, 3D space-based film creation with generative models. Specifically, we decompose 3D film creation into four key elements: 3D character, driven motion, camera movement, and environment. We extract the latter three elements from user-specified film shots and generate the 3D character using a generative model based on a provided image. To seamlessly recombine these elements and ensure smooth film creation, we propose structure-guided character animation, shape-aware camera movement optimization, and environment-aware generative refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating high-quality films with free camera and 3D characters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://liuff19.github.io/DreamCinema</p></details> |

Among them, Stable Diffusion (StableDiff) stands out as a key model for text-to-image generation and a foundation for next-generation multi-modal algorithms. However, its high computational and memory demands hinder inference speed and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we identify three core issues: (1) intensive and often redundant computations, (2) heterogeneous operations involving convolutions and attention mechanisms, and (3) diverse weight and activation sizes. We present SD-Acc, a novel algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework. At the algorithm level, we observe that high-level features in certain denoising phases show significant similarity, enabling approximate computation. Leveraging this, we propose an adaptive, phase-aware sampling strategy that reduces compute and memory loads. This framework automatically balances image quality and complexity based on the StableDiff model and user requirements. At the hardware level, we design an address-centric dataflow to efficiently handle heterogeneous operations within a simple systolic array. We address the bottleneck of nonlinear functions via a two-stage streaming architecture and a reconfigurable vector processing unit. Additionally, we implement adaptive dataflow optimizations by combining dynamic reuse and operator fusion tailored to StableDiff workloads, significantly reducing memory access. Across multiple StableDiff models, our method achieves up to a 3x reduction in computational demand without compromising image quality. Combined with our optimized hardware accelerator, SD-Acc delivers higher speed and energy efficiency than traditional CPU and GPU implementations.</p></details> | Under Review |

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Existing metrics are limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos. Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising 2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5% quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive, human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos.

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |

While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://robot4dgen.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Listener-Rewarded Thinking in VLMs for Image Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22832v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model ("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score, shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6% over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here: https://huggingface.co/alexgambashidze/qwen2.5vl_image_preference_reasoner.</p></details> |  |

We explore the affordance perception potential of text-to-video models by teaching them to predict human-environment interaction. Given a scene image and a prompt describing human actions, we fine-tune the model to insert a person into the scene, while ensuring coherent behavior, appearance, harmonization, and scene affordance. Unlike prior work, we infer human affordance for video generation (i.e., where to insert a person and how they should behave) from a single scene image, without explicit conditions like bounding boxes or body poses. An in-depth study of cross-attention heatmaps demonstrates that we can uncover the inherent affordance perception of a pre-trained video model without labeled affordance datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://shanmy.github.io/Populate-A-Scene</p></details> |
| **[FreeLong++: Training-Free Long Video Generation via Multi-band SpectralFusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00162v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation models have enabled high-quality short video generation from text prompts. However, extending these models to longer videos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal consistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively applying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable quality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where high-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows, an issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose FreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong achieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic semantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted from short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this, FreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture with multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale. By arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables multi-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both semantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video sequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into existing video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer videos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video generation tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length). It also supports coherent multi-prompt video generation with smooth scene transitions and enables controllable video generation using long depth or pose sequences.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Epona: Autoregressive Diffusion World Model for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24113v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling. However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning. This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end planners on NAVSIM benchmarks.

While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for high-res video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VMoBA</p></details> |

Existing approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or ''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines.

However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals).

In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos, achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://becauseimbatman0.github.io/ViewPoint</p></details> |

However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions.

However, incorporating causal relations as seen in real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion, Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video generation.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy training with generated data and policy evaluation.

Compared with previous methods, our approach has several highlights. Firstly, we introduce confidence-aware pose guidance that ensures high frame quality and temporal smoothness. Secondly, we introduce regional loss amplification based on pose confidence, which significantly reduces image distortion. Lastly, for generating long and smooth videos, we propose a progressive latent fusion strategy. By this means, we can produce videos of arbitrary length with acceptable resource consumption.

However, directly applying existing video editing methods to Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at least 20x inference speed-up and 85% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Zero-...</summary><p>Zero-shot video editing</p></details> |

Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon, leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames, achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on long-horizon tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding, their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation. This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce ShotBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed (predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60% average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct ShotQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop ShotVL through supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on ShotBench, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to the complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in artifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a conditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural singing voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage and often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized audio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated with two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch architecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference to guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware synthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel low-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch contours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during training, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio, addressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals. Experiments on the Opencpop dataset, a large-scale Chinese singing corpus, demonstrate that SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective evaluations. Extensive ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing artifacts and improving the naturalness of synthesized voices.</p></details> |  |

Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame, HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for practical surgical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames. Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods, though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task, which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI is superior to previous works.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Video Perception Models for 3D Scene Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20601v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability, which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes. Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation, utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse scenarios. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, existing panoramic video generation models struggle to leverage pre-trained generative priors from conventional text-to-video models for high-quality and diverse panoramic videos generation, due to limited dataset scale and the gap in spatial feature representations. In this paper, we introduce PanoWan to effectively lift pre-trained text-to-video models to the panoramic domain, equipped with minimal modules. PanoWan employs latitude-aware sampling to avoid latitudinal distortion, while its rotated semantic denoising and padded pixel-wise decoding ensure seamless transitions at longitude boundaries. To provide sufficient panoramic videos for learning these lifted representations, we contribute PanoVid, a high-quality panoramic video dataset with captions and diverse scenarios. Consequently, PanoWan achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and demonstrates robustness for zero-shot downstream tasks.

Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust. Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs) on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at: https://broken-video-detection-datetsets.github.io/Broken-Video-Detection-Datasets.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 page,4 figures,2 tables</p></details> |

A Comprehensive Survey of World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14499v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of world models has garnered significant attention due to advancements in multimodal large language models such as GPT-4 and video generation models such as Sora, which are central to the pursuit of artificial general intelligence. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the literature on world models. Generally, world models are regarded as tools for either understanding the present state of the world or predicting its future dynamics. This review presents a systematic categorization of world models, emphasizing two primary functions: (1) constructing internal representations to understand the mechanisms of the world, and (2) predicting future states to simulate and guide decision-making. Initially, we examine the current progress in these two categories. We then explore the application of world models in key domains, including autonomous driving, robotics, and social simulacra, with a focus on how each domain utilizes these aspects. Finally, we outline key challenges and provide insights into potential future research directions. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/World-Model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CSUR, 37 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/radial-attention</p></details> |
| **[GenHSI: Controllable Generation of Human-Scene Interaction Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19840v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes (storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images. We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training. Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible human-scene interaction from a single image scene.

| **[SimpleGVR: A Simple Baseline for Latent-Cascaded Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19838v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage available at https://simplegvr.github.io/</p></details> |

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what' together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise, fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance over multiple state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Anime Video Generation with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10044v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anime video generation faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of anime data and unusual motion patterns, leading to issues such as motion distortion and flickering artifacts, which result in misalignment with human preferences. Existing reward models, designed primarily for real-world videos, fail to capture the unique appearance and consistency requirements of anime. In this work, we propose a pipeline to enhance anime video generation by leveraging human feedback for better alignment. Specifically, we construct the first multi-dimensional reward dataset for anime videos, comprising 30k human-annotated samples that incorporating human preferences for both visual appearance and visual consistency. Based on this, we develop AnimeReward, a powerful reward model that employs specialized vision-language models for different evaluation dimensions to guide preference alignment. Furthermore, we introduce Gap-Aware Preference Optimization (GAPO), a novel training method that explicitly incorporates preference gaps into the optimization process, enhancing alignment performance and efficiency. Extensive experiment results show that AnimeReward outperforms existing reward models, and the inclusion of GAPO leads to superior alignment in both quantitative benchmarks and human evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing anime video quality.

Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing training-free methods, originally designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models. To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality while preserving high efficiency.

While previous methods rely on manual annotations or calibrated multi-view images, both of which are expensive to collect, our method enables monocular 3D keypoints estimation using only a collection of single-view images. To achieve this, we leverage powerful geometric priors embedded in a pretrained multi-view diffusion model. In our framework, this model generates multi-view images from a single image, serving as a supervision signal to provide 3D geometric cues to our model. We also use the diffusion model as a powerful 2D multi-view feature extractor and construct 3D feature volumes from its intermediate representations. This transforms implicit 3D priors learned by the diffusion model into explicit 3D features. Beyond accurate keypoints estimation, we further introduce a pipeline that enables manipulation of 3D objects generated by the diffusion model. Experimental results on diverse aspects and datasets, including Human3.6M, Stanford Dogs, and several in-the-wild and out-of-domain datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method in terms of accuracy, generalization, and its ability to enable manipulation of 3D objects generated by the diffusion model from a single image.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission, 22 pages, 7 tables, 12 figures</p></details> |

The latest works addressing scene completion with diffusion models tackle this problem by reformulating the original DDPM as a local diffusion process. It contrasts with the common practice of operating at the level of objects, where vanilla DDPMs are currently used. In this work, we close the gap between these two lines of work. We identify approximations in the local diffusion formulation, show that they are not required to operate at the scene level, and that a vanilla DDPM with a well-chosen starting point is enough for completion. Finally, we demonstrate that our method, LiDPM, leads to better results in scene completion on SemanticKITTI.

In this work, we reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands demonstrate that RODS improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress in RM construction using data-driven approaches, most existing methods focus solely on pathloss prediction in a fixed 2D plane, neglecting key parameters such as direction of arrival (DoA), time of arrival (ToA), and vertical spatial variations. Such a limitation is primarily due to the reliance on static learning paradigms, which hinder generalization beyond the training data distribution. To address these challenges, we propose UrbanRadio3D, a large-scale, high-resolution 3D RM dataset constructed via ray tracing in realistic urban environments. UrbanRadio3D is over 37$\times$3 larger than previous datasets across a 3D space with 3 metrics as pathloss, DoA, and ToA, forming a novel 3D$\times$33D dataset with 7$\times$3 more height layers than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset. To benchmark 3D RM construction, a UNet with 3D convolutional operators is proposed. Moreover, we further introduce RadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based generative framework utilizing the 3D convolutional architecture. RadioDiff-3D supports both radiation-aware scenarios with known transmitter locations and radiation-unaware settings based on sparse spatial observations. Extensive evaluations on UrbanRadio3D validate that RadioDiff-3D achieves superior performance in constructing rich, high-dimensional radio maps under diverse environmental dynamics. This work provides a foundational dataset and benchmark for future research in 3D environment-aware communication. The dataset is available at https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/UrbanRadio3D.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmokeSVD: Smoke Reconstruction from A Single View via Progressive Novel View Synthesis and Refinement with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12156v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing dynamic fluids from sparse views is a long-standing and challenging problem, due to the severe lack of 3D information from insufficient view coverage. While several pioneering approaches have attempted to address this issue using differentiable rendering or novel view synthesis, they are often limited by time-consuming optimization and refinement processes under ill-posed conditions. To tackle above challenges, we propose SmokeSVD, an efficient and effective framework to progressively generate and reconstruct dynamic smoke from a single video by integrating both the powerful generative capabilities from diffusion models and physically guided consistency optimization towards realistic appearance and dynamic evolution. Specifically, we first propose a physically guided side-view synthesizer based on diffusion models, which explicitly incorporates divergence and gradient guidance of velocity fields to generate visually realistic and spatio-temporally consistent side-view images frame by frame, significantly alleviating the ill-posedness of single-view reconstruction without imposing additional constraints. Subsequently, we determine a rough estimation of density field from the pair of front-view input and side-view synthetic image, and further refine 2D blurry novel-view images and 3D coarse-grained density field through an iterative process that progressively renders and enhances the images from increasing novel viewing angles, generating high-quality multi-view image sequences. Finally, we reconstruct and estimate the fine-grained density field, velocity field, and smoke source via differentiable advection by leveraging the Navier-Stokes equations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our approach achieves high-quality reconstruction and outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Skeleton-Text Modality Gap: Diffusion-Powered Modality Alignment for Zero-shot Skeleton-based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10745v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition (ZSAR), aligning skeleton features with the text features of action labels is essential for accurately predicting unseen actions. ZSAR faces a fundamental challenge in bridging the modality gap between the two-kind features, which severely limits generalization to unseen actions. Previous methods focus on direct alignment between skeleton and text latent spaces, but the modality gaps between these spaces hinder robust generalization learning. Motivated by the success of diffusion models in multi-modal alignment (e.g., text-to-image, text-to-video), we firstly present a diffusion-based skeleton-text alignment framework for ZSAR. Our approach, Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM), focuses on cross-alignment power of diffusion models rather than their generative capability. Specifically, TDSM aligns skeleton features with text prompts by incorporating text features into the reverse diffusion process, where skeleton features are denoised under text guidance, forming a unified skeleton-text latent space for robust matching. To enhance discriminative power, we introduce a triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to correct skeleton-text matches while pushing them apart for different action classes. Our TDSM significantly outperforms very recent state-of-the-art methods with significantly large margins of 2.36%-point to 13.05%-point, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability in zero-shot settings through effective skeleton-text matching.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (camera-ready version).

To curb the spread of harmful content and promote the dissemination of reliable information, research on cascade graph mining has attracted increasing attention. A promising approach in this area is Contrastive Cascade Graph Learning (CCGL). One important task in cascade graph mining is cascade classification, which involves categorizing cascade graphs based on their structural characteristics. Although CCGL is expected to be effective for this task, its performance has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of CCGL for cascade classification. Our findings demonstrate the strong performance of CCGL in capturing platform- and model-specific structural patterns in cascade graphs, highlighting its potential for a range of downstream information diffusion analysis tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boost 3D Reconstruction using Diffusion-based Monocular Camera Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17240v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present DM-Calib, a diffusion-based approach for estimating pinhole camera intrinsic parameters from a single input image. Monocular camera calibration is essential for many 3D vision tasks. However, most existing methods depend on handcrafted assumptions or are constrained by limited training data, resulting in poor generalization across diverse real-world images. Recent advancements in stable diffusion models, trained on massive data, have shown the ability to generate high-quality images with varied characteristics. Emerging evidence indicates that these models implicitly capture the relationship between camera focal length and image content. Building on this insight, we explore how to leverage the powerful priors of diffusion models for monocular pinhole camera calibration. Specifically, we introduce a new image-based representation, termed Camera Image, which losslessly encodes the numerical camera intrinsics and integrates seamlessly with the diffusion framework. Using this representation, we reformulate the problem of estimating camera intrinsics as the generation of a dense Camera Image conditioned on an input image. By fine-tuning a stable diffusion model to generate a Camera Image from a single RGB input, we can extract camera intrinsics via a RANSAC operation. We further demonstrate that our monocular calibration method enhances performance across various 3D tasks, including zero-shot metric depth estimation, 3D metrology, pose estimation and sparse-view reconstruction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and provides broad benefits to 3D vision tasks.</p></details> |  |

Due to the inherent randomsampling characteristics ofdiffusion models, direct application in super-resolu-tion tasks can result in generated details deviating from the true distribution ofhigh-resolution images. To address this, we propose DeltaDiff, a novel frame.work that constrains the difusion process, its essence is to establish a determin-istic mapping path between HR and LR, rather than the random noise disturbanceprocess oftraditional difusion models. Theoretical analysis demonstrates a 25%reduction in diffusion entropy in the residual space compared to pixel-space diffiusion, effectively suppressing irrelevant noise interference. The experimentalresults show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art models and generates re-sults with better fidelity. This work establishes a new low-rank constrained par-adigm for applying diffusion models to image reconstruction tasks, balancingstochastic generation with structural fidelity.

This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.</p></details> |  |
| **[EC-Diff: Fast and High-Quality Edge-Cloud Collaborative Inference for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11980v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models have shown remarkable proficiency in image and video synthesis. As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality. Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise approximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances generation quality compared to edge inference, while achieving up to an average $2\times$ speedup in inference compared to cloud inference.

Existing scene text removal models require complex annotation and retraining, and may leave faint yet recognizable text information, compromising privacy protection and content concealment. TextDestroyer addresses these issues by employing a three-stage hierarchical process to obtain accurate text masks. Our method scrambles text areas in the latent start code using a Gaussian distribution before reconstruction. During the diffusion denoising process, self-attention key and value are referenced from the original latent to restore the compromised background. Latent codes saved at each inversion step are used for replacement during reconstruction, ensuring perfect background restoration. The advantages of TextDestroyer include: (1) it eliminates labor-intensive data annotation and resource-intensive training; (2) it achieves more thorough text destruction, preventing recognizable traces; and (3) it demonstrates better generalization capabilities, performing well on both real-world scenes and generated images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11866v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sequential recommendation systems, data augmentation and contrastive learning techniques have recently been introduced using diffusion models to achieve robust representation learning. However, most of the existing approaches use random augmentation, which risk damaging the contextual information of the original sequence. Accordingly, we propose a Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation. Our method leverages the similarity between item embedding vectors to generate semantically consistent noise. Moreover, we utilize high confidence score in the denoising process to select our augmentation positions. This approach more effectively reflects contextual and structural information compared to augmentation at random positions. From a contrastive learning perspective, the proposed augmentation technique provides more discriminative positive and negative samples, simultaneously improving training efficiency and recommendation performance. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that SimDiffRec outperforms the existing baseline models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we address the challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy by making several key modifications, 1) Multi-step AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step ODE sampler, significantly reducing computational overhead for the diffusion module part during inference; 2) In the open-source Protenix framework, a subset of pairformer or diffusion transformer blocks doesn't make contributions to the final structure prediction, presenting opportunities for architectural pruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model incorporating an ESM module is trained to substitute the conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing time. Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a compact and optimized model designed for efficient protein structure prediction. This streamlined version incorporates a more efficient architectural design with a two-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating redundant Transformer components and refining the sampling process, Protenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity with slight accuracy drop. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity predictions, with only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on benchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart. This makes Protenix-Mini an ideal choice for applications where computational resources are limited but accurate structure prediction remains crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Peer Review and the Diffusion of Ideas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11825v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines a fundamental yet overlooked function of peer review: its role in exposing reviewers to new and unexpected ideas. Leveraging a natural experiment involving over half a million peer review invitations covering both accepted and rejected manuscripts, and integrating high-scale bibliographic and editorial records for 37,279 submitting authors, we find that exposure to a manuscript's core ideas significantly influences the future referencing behavior and knowledge of reviewer invitees who decline the review invite. Specifically, declining reviewer invitees who could view concise summaries of the manuscript's core ideas not only increase their citations to the manuscript itself but also demonstrate expanded breadth, depth, diversity, and prominence of citations to the submitting author's broader body of work. Overall, these results suggest peer review substantially influences the spread of scientific knowledge. Ironically, while the massive scale of peer review, entailing millions of reviews annually, often drives policy debates about its costs and burdens, our findings demonstrate that precisely because of this scale, peer review serves as a powerful yet previously unrecognized engine for idea diffusion, which is central to scientific advances and scholarly communication.</p></details> |  |
| **[AirLLM: Diffusion Policy-based Adaptive LoRA for Remote Fine-Tuning of LLM over the Air](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11515v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable. Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards. Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven, diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning over the air.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

Although quantization paves a way for model compression and acceleration, existing methods face challenges in achieving low-bit quantization efficiently. In this paper, we identify imbalanced activation distributions as a primary source of quantization difficulty, and propose to adjust these distributions through weight finetuning to be more quantization-friendly. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting finetuning as a practical and reliable solution. Building on this approach, we further distinguish two critical types of quantized layers: those responsible for retaining essential temporal information and those particularly sensitive to bit-width reduction. By selectively finetuning these layers under both local and global supervision, we mitigate performance degradation while enhancing quantization efficiency. Our method demonstrates its efficacy across three high-resolution image generation tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance across multiple bit-width settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

This limitation primarily stems from their constrained replanning ability: they either operate at a low frequency due to a time-consuming iterative sampling process, or are unable to adapt to unforeseen feedback in case of rapid replanning. To address these challenges, we propose RA-DP, a novel diffusion policy framework with training-free high-frequency replanning ability that solves the above limitations in adapting to unforeseen dynamic environments. Specifically, our method integrates guidance signals which are often easily obtained in the new environment during the diffusion sampling process, and utilizes a novel action queue mechanism to generate replanned actions at every denoising step without retraining, thus forming a complete training-free framework for robot motion adaptation in unseen environments. Extensive evaluations have been conducted in both well-recognized simulation benchmarks and real robot tasks. Results show that RA-DP outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in terms of replanning frequency and success rate. Moreover, we show that our framework is theoretically compatible with any training-free guidance signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

To address this, network quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the quality of the generated images across various datasets.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

However, it poses significant challenges due to the high-dimensional action space and intricate coordination requirements. While video prediction has been recently studied for representation learning and control, leveraging its ability to capture rich dynamic and behavioral information, its potential for enhancing bimanual coordination remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified diffusion-based framework for the joint optimization of video and action prediction. Specifically, we propose a multi-frame latent prediction strategy that encodes future states in a compressed latent space, preserving task-relevant features. Furthermore, we introduce a unidirectional attention mechanism where video prediction is conditioned on the action, while action prediction remains independent of video prediction. This design allows us to omit video prediction during inference, significantly enhancing efficiency. Experiments on two simulated benchmarks and a real-world setting demonstrate a significant improvement in the success rate over the strong baseline ACT using our method, achieving a \textbf{24.9\%} increase on ALOHA, an \textbf{11.1\%} increase on RoboTwin, and a \textbf{32.5\%} increase in real-world experiments.

The proposed method integrates three core innovations: (1) A diffusion-based trajectory generation framework that produces physically feasible multi-step trajectories, enhanced by a high-dimensional state encoding mechanism combining current observations with historical states and actions through a novel diffusion U-Net architecture, significantly improving long-horizon planning. (2) A sample-efficient hybrid learning architecture that synergizes diffusion-guided exploration with RL policy optimization, where the diffusion model generates diverse candidate actions and the RL critic selects optimal actions, achieving higher exploration efficiency and policy stability in dynamic underwater environments. Extensive simulation experiments validating the method's superior robustness and flexibility, outperforms conventional control methods in challenging marine conditions, offering enhanced adaptability and reliability for AUV operations in the underwater tasks.</p></details> |  |

SIAM J. Appl. Math. 2023] the authors introduce a finite-volume method for aggregation-diffusion equations with non-linear mobility. In this paper we prove convergence of this method using an Aubin--Simons compactness theorem due to Gallou\"et and Latch\'e. We use suitable discrete $H^1$ and $W^{-1,1}$ discrete norms. We provide two convergence results. A first result shows convergence with general entropies ($U$) (including singular and degenerate) if the initial datum does not have free boundaries, the mobility is Lipschitz, and the confinement ($V$) and aggregation ($K$) potentials are $W^{2,\infty}_0$. A second result shows convergence when the initial datum has free boundaries, mobility is just continuous, and $V$ and $K$ are $W^{1,\infty}$, but under the assumption that the entropy $U$ is $C^1$ and strictly convex.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Devil behind the mask: An emergent safety vulnerability of Diffusion LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11097v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling. However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts, exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.

| **[FA-Seg: A Fast and Accurate Diffusion-Based Method for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23323v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets. Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the computation costs and the quality of the segmentation mask. In this work, we present FA-Seg, a Fast and Accurate training-free framework for open-vocabulary segmentation based on diffusion models. FA-Seg performs segmentation using only a (1+1)-step from a pretrained diffusion model. Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FA-Seg performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the segmentation quality, FA-Seg introduces three key components: (i) a dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction, (ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances semantic precision via multi-resolution attention fusion, and (iii) a Test-Time Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive experiments show that FA-Seg achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that FA-Seg provides a strong foundation for extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference efficiency. The source code will be open-sourced after this paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional GANs or diffusion models, our approach explicitly enforces boundary consistency between CBCT inputs and pseudo targets, ensuring both anatomical fidelity and perceptual controllability. Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free guidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically preferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based preference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying on a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed method selectively attenuates shade artifacts in key anatomical regions while preserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate superior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical datasets -- outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods -- while requiring only 10 sampling steps. These findings underscore the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned medical image translation.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, the ultimate measure of effectiveness is their successful transition from simulation to reality (sim2real). However, existing sim2real transfer methods struggle to address the autonomy-oriented requirements of balancing: (i) conditioned domain adaptation, (ii) robust performance with limited examples, (iii) modularity in handling multiple domain representations, and (iv) real-time performance. To alleviate these pain points, we present a unified framework for learning cross-domain adaptive representations through conditional latent diffusion for sim2real transferable autonomous driving algorithms. Our framework offers options to leverage: (i) alternate foundation models, (ii) a few-shot fine-tuning pipeline, and (iii) textual as well as image prompts for mapping across given source and target domains. It is also capable of generating diverse high-quality samples when diffusing across parameter spaces such as times of day, weather conditions, seasons, and operational design domains. We systematically analyze the presented framework and report our findings in terms of performance benchmarks and ablation studies, with critical quantitative metrics as well as insightful qualitative examples and remarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the serviceability of sim2real diffusion for autonomous driving using a behavioral cloning case study. Our experiments indicate that the proposed framework is capable of bridging the perceptual sim2real gap by over 40%, which highlights the potential of diffusion models in sim2real transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Decoding for Peptide De Novo Sequencing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10955v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Peptide de novo sequencing is a method used to reconstruct amino acid sequences from tandem mass spectrometry data without relying on existing protein sequence databases. Traditional deep learning approaches, such as Casanovo, mainly utilize autoregressive decoders and predict amino acids sequentially. Subsequently, they encounter cascading errors and fail to leverage high-confidence regions effectively. To address these issues, this paper investigates using diffusion decoders adapted for the discrete data domain. These decoders provide a different approach, allowing sequence generation to start from any peptide segment, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. We experiment with three different diffusion decoder designs, knapsack beam search, and various loss functions. We find knapsack beam search did not improve performance metrics and simply replacing the transformer decoder with a diffusion decoder lowered performance. Although peptide precision and recall were still 0, the best diffusion decoder design with the DINOISER loss function obtained a statistically significant improvement in amino acid recall by 0.373 compared to the baseline autoregressive decoder-based Casanovo model. These findings highlight the potential of diffusion decoders to not only enhance model sensitivity but also drive significant advancements in peptide de novo sequencing.</p></details> |  |

Despite its central role in clinical and cognitive science, real-world reappraisal interventions remain cognitively demanding, abstract, and primarily verbal. This reliance on higher-order cognitive and linguistic processes is often impaired in individuals with trauma or depression, limiting the effectiveness of standard approaches. Here, we propose a novel, visually based augmentation of cognitive reappraisal by integrating large-scale text-to-image diffusion models into the emotional regulation process. Specifically, we introduce a system in which users reinterpret emotionally negative images via spoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive, emotionally congruent visualizations using stable diffusion models with a fine-tuned IP-adapter. This generative transformation visually instantiates users' reappraisals while maintaining structural similarity to the original stimuli, externalizing and reinforcing regulatory intent. To test this approach, we conducted a within-subject experiment (N = 20) using a modified cognitive emotion regulation (CER) task. Participants reappraised or described aversive images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), with or without AI-generated visual feedback. Results show that AI-assisted reappraisal significantly reduced negative affect compared to both non-AI and control conditions. Further analyses reveal that sentiment alignment between participant reappraisals and generated images correlates with affective relief, suggesting that multimodal coherence enhances regulatory efficacy. These findings demonstrate that generative visual input can support cogitive reappraisal and open new directions at the intersection of generative AI, affective computing, and therapeutic technology.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes, moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and loss of details.

| **[Modeling Item-Level Dynamic Variability with Residual Diffusion for Bundle Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03280v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing solutions for bundle recommendation(BR) have achieved remarkable effectiveness for predicting the user's preference for prebuilt bundles. However, bundle-item(B-I) affiliation will vary dynamically in real scenarios. For example, a bundle themed as 'casual outfit', may add 'hat' or remove 'watch' due to factors such as seasonal variations, changes in user pes or inventory adjustments. Our empirical study demonstrates that the performance of mainstream BR models will fluctuate or even decline regarding item-level variability. This paper makes the first attempt to referencaddress the above problem and proposes a novel Residual Diffusion for Bundle Recommendation(RDiffBR) as a model-agnostic generative framework which can assist a BR model in adapting this scenario. During the initial training of the BR model, RDiffBR employs a residual diffusion model to process the item-level bundle embeddings which are generated by BR model to represent bundle theme via a forward-reverse process. In the inference stage, RDiffBR reverses item-level bundle embeddings obtained by the well-trained bundle model under B-I variability scenarios to generate the effective item-level bundle embeddings. In particular, the residual connection in our residual approximator significantly enhances item-level bundle embeddings generation ability of BR models. Experiments on six BR models and four public datasets from different domains show that RDiffBR improves the performance of Recall and NDCG of backbone BR models by up to 23%, while only increased training time about 4%.Codes and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RDiffBR.</p></details> |  |

While prior approaches-including waveform and spectrogram-based diffusion models-have shown promising results for short gaps, they often degrade in quality when gaps exceed 100 milliseconds (ms). In this work, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion modeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a pre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process directly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically coherent reconstruction of missing audio. We evaluate the method on the MusicNet dataset using both objective and perceptual metrics across gap durations up to 300 ms. We further evaluated our approach on the MTG dataset, extending the gap duration to 500 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing baselines, particularly for longer gaps, offering a robust solution for restoring degraded musical recordings.

| **[Frequency Regulation for Exposure Bias Mitigation in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10072v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias across different model architectures.

| **[Memory-Efficient Personalization of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Selective Optimization Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10029v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable, high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[EAT: QoS-Aware Edge-Collaborative AIGC Task Scheduling via Attention-Guided Diffusion Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10026v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and large language models has enabled the use of Generative AI (GenAI) in cloud data centers for diverse AI-Generated Content (AIGC) tasks. Models like Stable Diffusion introduce unavoidable delays and substantial resource overhead, which are unsuitable for users at the network edge with high QoS demands. Deploying AIGC services on edge servers reduces transmission times but often leads to underutilized resources and fails to optimally balance inference latency and quality. To address these issues, this paper introduces a QoS-aware \underline{E}dge-collaborative \underline{A}IGC \underline{T}ask scheduling (EAT) algorithm. Specifically: 1) We segment AIGC tasks and schedule patches to various edge servers, formulating it as a gang scheduling problem that balances inference latency and quality while considering server heterogeneity, such as differing model distributions and cold start issues. 2) We propose a reinforcement learning-based EAT algorithm that uses an attention layer to extract load and task queue information from edge servers and employs a diffusion-based policy network for scheduling, efficiently enabling model reuse. 3) We develop an AIGC task scheduling system that uses our EAT algorithm to divide tasks and distribute them across multiple edge servers for processing. Experimental results based on our system and large-scale simulations show that our EAT algorithm can reduce inference latency by up to 56\% compared to baselines. We release our open-source code at https://github.com/zzf1955/EAT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Swin Transformer for enhanced diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using multi-shell diffusion MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09996v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision transformer-based deep learning framework. Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia) and amyloid status classification. Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of 95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model predictions. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited biomedical settings.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders (LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders (OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

| **[3D Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model for Whole-Body MR-to-CT Modality Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11557v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony structures and soft-tissue contrast.</p></details> |  |
| **[DNF-Intrinsic: Deterministic Noise-Free Diffusion for Indoor Inverse Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03924v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods have shown that pre-trained diffusion models can be fine-tuned to enable generative inverse rendering by learning image-conditioned noise-to-intrinsic mapping. Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching. Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |

We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathcal P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathcal Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&P 500.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on https://github.com/fy-yuan/diffusion_dynamic_mv</p></details> |
| **[Unraveling the Connections between Flow Matching and Diffusion Probabilistic Models in Training-free Conditional Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07625v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-free conditional generation based on flow matching aims to leverage pre-trained unconditional flow matching models to perform conditional generation without retraining. Recently, a successful training-free conditional generation approach incorporates conditions via posterior sampling, which relies on the availability of a score function in the unconditional diffusion model. However, flow matching models do not possess an explicit score function, rendering such a strategy inapplicable. Approximate posterior sampling for flow matching has been explored, but it is limited to linear inverse problems. In this paper, we propose Flow Matching-based Posterior Sampling (FMPS) to expand its application scope. We introduce a correction term by steering the velocity field. This correction term can be reformulated to incorporate a surrogate score function, thereby bridging the gap between flow matching models and score-based posterior sampling. Hence, FMPS enables the posterior sampling to be adjusted within the flow matching framework. Further, we propose two practical implementations of the correction mechanism: one aimed at improving generation quality, and the other focused on computational efficiency. Experimental results on diverse conditional generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation quality compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness and generality of FMPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inversion-DPO: Precise and Efficient Post-Training for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11554v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several trajectory inference techniques under the framework of gradient flow matching, providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts, where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[A General Framework for Inference-time Scaling and Steering of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06848v4)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we present Feynman-Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models - even with off-the-shelf rewards - can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

| **[Compression-Aware One-Step Diffusion Model for JPEG Artifact Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09873v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image restoration tasks. However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code is released at https://github.com/jp-guo/CODiff.</p></details> |  |

Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions. By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics simulation framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures.

However, existing multi-task planners or policies typically rely on task-specific demonstrations via multi-task imitation, or require task-specific reward labels to facilitate policy optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL). They are costly due to the substantial human efforts required to collect expert data or design reward functions. To address these challenges, we aim to develop a versatile diffusion planner capable of leveraging large-scale inferior data that contains task-agnostic sub-optimal trajectories, with the ability to fast adapt to specific tasks. In this paper, we propose SODP, a two-stage framework that leverages Sub-Optimal data to learn a Diffusion Planner, which is generalizable for various downstream tasks. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, we train a foundation diffusion planner that extracts general planning capabilities by modeling the versatile distribution of multi-task trajectories, which can be sub-optimal and has wide data coverage. Then for downstream tasks, we adopt RL-based fine-tuning with task-specific rewards to quickly refine the diffusion planner, which aims to generate action sequences with higher task-specific returns. Experimental results from multi-task domains including Meta-World and Adroit demonstrate that SODP outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only a small amount of data for reward-guided fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2025</p></details> |

While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UBCDingXin/CCDM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

We prove that the expected denoiser output under the forward corruption distribution recovers the true posterior, and that a simple Monte Carlo estimator converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)) with finite-sample concentration bounds. Building on this insight, we introduce an inference-time ensemble that runs K independent denoising passes and aggregates both posterior means and variances without any extra training. On WikiText-2, our MC-marginal sampler recovers the analytic lambda-DCE zero-shot perplexity (approximately 39) to within a few points at K=128, and its per-token variance shows a strong rank correlation with reconstruction error (Spearman rho = 0.996). This cost-proportional procedure yields calibrated uncertainty estimates and a direct trade-off between compute and posterior fidelity in discrete diffusion LMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Although there are several well-known phase retrieval algorithms, including classical iterative solvers, the reconstruction performance often remains sensitive to initialization and measurement noise. Recently, image-to-image diffusion models have gained traction in various image reconstruction tasks, yielding significant theoretical insights and practical breakthroughs. In this work, we introduce a novel phase retrieval approach based on an image-to-image diffusion framework called Inversion by Direct Iteration. Our method begins with an enhanced initialization stage that leverages a hybrid iterative technique, combining the Hybrid Input-Output and Error Reduction methods and incorporating a novel acceleration mechanism to obtain a robust crude estimate. Then, it iteratively refines this initial crude estimate using the learned image-to-image pipeline. Our method achieves substantial improvements in both training efficiency and reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our approach utilizes aggregation techniques to refine quality metrics and demonstrates superior results compared to both classical and contemporary techniques. This highlights its potential for effective and efficient phase retrieval across various applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a novel framework that integrates the generative strength of diffusion models with the adaptive search capabilities of MCTS. Our method reconceptualizes denoising as a tree-structured process, allowing partially denoised plans to be iteratively evaluated, pruned, and refined. By selectively expanding promising trajectories while retaining the flexibility to revisit and improve suboptimal branches, MCTD achieves the benefits of MCTS such as controlling exploration-exploitation trade-offs within the diffusion framework. Empirical results on challenging long-horizon tasks show that MCTD outperforms diffusion baselines, yielding higher-quality solutions as inference-time computation increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, ICML 2025 Main Track Spotlight</p></details> |

However, many existing methods rely on behavior cloning with supervised historical trajectories, limiting their 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal awareness. Consequently, these methods struggle to capture the 3D structures and 4D spatiotemporal relationships necessary for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4), a novel visual imitation learning method that incorporates spatiotemporal awareness into diffusion-based policies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on trajectory cloning, DP4 leverages a dynamic Gaussian world model to guide the learning of 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal perceptions from interactive environments. Our method constructs the current 3D scene from a single-view RGB-D observation and predicts the future 3D scene, optimizing trajectory generation by explicitly modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments across 17 simulation tasks with 173 variants and 3 real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that the 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4) outperforms baseline methods, improving the average simulation task success rate by 16.4% (Adroit), 14% (DexArt), and 6.45% (RLBench), and the average real-world robotic task success rate by 8.6%.</p></details> |  |

While very few public datasets are available, they are typically static, slow to generate, and require frequent updates. To address these limitations, we present DALI-PD, a scalable framework for generating synthetic layout heatmaps to accelerate ML in PD research. DALI-PD uses a diffusion model to generate diverse layout heatmaps via fast inference in seconds. The heatmaps include power, IR drop, congestion, macro placement, and cell density maps. Using DALI-PD, we created a dataset comprising over 20,000 layout configurations with varying macro counts and placements.

| **[AGFS-Tractometry: A Novel Atlas-Guided Fine-Scale Tractometry Approach for Enhanced Along-Tract Group Statistical Comparison Using Diffusion MRI Tractography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10601v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations. There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale, along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments, AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially localized WM group-level differences. The created tract profiling template and related code are available at: https://github.com/ZhengRuixi/AGFS-Tractometry.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages and 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Streamline-based diffusion MRI Tractography Registration Method with Probabilistic Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02481v2)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Registration of diffusion MRI tractography is an essential step for analyzing group similarities and variations in the brain's white matter (WM). Streamline-based registration approaches can leverage the 3D geometric information of fiber pathways to enable spatial alignment after registration. Existing methods usually rely on the optimization of the spatial distances to identify the optimal transformation. However, such methods overlook point connectivity patterns within the streamline itself, limiting their ability to identify anatomical correspondences across tractography datasets. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised approach using deep learning to perform streamline-based dMRI tractography registration. The overall idea is to identify corresponding keypoint pairs across subjects for spatial alignment of tractography datasets. We model tractography as point clouds to leverage the graph connectivity along streamlines. We propose a novel keypoint detection method for streamlines, framed as a probabilistic classification task to identify anatomically consistent correspondences across unstructured streamline sets. In the experiments, we compare several existing methods and show highly effective and efficient tractography registration performance.</p></details> |  |

A splitting strategy allows us to decompose the random system into a space-discrete heat equation with a stochastic boundary condition, and a nonlinear and nonlocal space-discrete differential system coupled with the first one and with deterministic initial and boundary conditions. The convergence result is obtained by first establishing some a priori estimates for both space-discrete splitted variables and then exploiting compact embedding theorems for time-space Besov spaces on the positive lattice. The convergence of a fully discrete approximation of the random system is also discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[PanoDiff-SR: Synthesizing Dental Panoramic Radiographs using Diffusion and Super-resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09227v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been increasing interest in the generation of high-quality, realistic synthetic medical images in recent years. Such synthetic datasets can mitigate the scarcity of public datasets for artificial intelligence research, and can also be used for educational purposes. In this paper, we propose a combination of diffusion-based generation (PanoDiff) and Super-Resolution (SR) for generating synthetic dental panoramic radiographs (PRs). The former generates a low-resolution (LR) seed of a PR (256 X 128) which is then processed by the SR model to yield a high-resolution (HR) PR of size 1024 X 512. For SR, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer that learns local-global relationships, resulting in sharper edges and textures. Experimental results demonstrate a Frechet inception distance score of 40.69 between 7243 real and synthetic images (in HR). Inception scores were 2.55, 2.30, 2.90 and 2.98 for real HR, synthetic HR, real LR and synthetic LR images, respectively. Among a diverse group of six clinical experts, all evaluating a mixture of 100 synthetic and 100 real PRs in a time-limited observation, the average accuracy in distinguishing real from synthetic images was 68.5% (with 50% corresponding to random guessing).</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Dataset Condensation: Training Your Diffusion Model Faster with Less Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05914v2)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative tasks, but training them remains highly resource-intensive, often requiring millions of images and many days of GPU computation. From a data-centric perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a "synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Iintr...</summary><p>Iintroduces D2C: a novel framework for diffusion dataset condensation</p></details> |
| **[Interactive Drawing Guidance for Anime Illustrations with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09140v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating high-quality anime illustrations presents notable challenges, particularly for beginners, due to the intricate styles and fine details inherent in anime art. We present an interactive drawing guidance system specifically designed for anime illustrations to address this issue. It offers real-time guidance to help users refine their work and streamline the creative process. Our system is built upon the StreamDiffusion pipeline to deliver real-time drawing assistance. We fine-tune Stable Diffusion with LoRA to synthesize anime style RGB images from user-provided hand-drawn sketches and prompts. Leveraging the Informative Drawings model, we transform these RGB images into rough sketches, which are further refined into structured guidance sketches using a custom-designed optimizer. The proposed system offers precise, real-time guidance aligned with the creative intent of the user, significantly enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of the drawing process. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a user study, gathering empirical feedback on both system performance and interface usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Hybrid Autoregressive-Diffusion Model for Real-Time Streaming Sign Language Production](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09105v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it, we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Point Cloud Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09102v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point cloud self-supervised learning.

| **[Temporal Feature Matters: A Framework for Diffusion Model Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19547v4)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI 2025. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.16503</p></details> |
| **[Can Contrastive Learning Improve Class-Imbalanced Diffusion Model?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09052v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions. Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and ImageNetLT.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
