| **[Generative View Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24718v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free, frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase.

| **[Reg-DPO: SFT-Regularized Direct Preference Optimization with GT-Pair for Improving Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01450v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have identified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as an efficient and reward-free approach to improving video generation quality. However, existing methods largely follow image-domain paradigms and are mainly developed on small-scale models (approximately 2B parameters), limiting their ability to address the unique challenges of video tasks, such as costly data construction, unstable training, and heavy memory consumption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a GT-Pair that automatically builds high-quality preference pairs by using real videos as positives and model-generated videos as negatives, eliminating the need for any external annotation. We further present Reg-DPO, which incorporates the SFT loss as a regularization term into the DPO loss to enhance training stability and generation fidelity. Additionally, by combining the FSDP framework with multiple memory optimization techniques, our approach achieves nearly three times higher training capacity than using FSDP alone. Extensive experiments on both I2V and T2V tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, delivering superior video generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniAVGen: Unified Audio and Video Generation with Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03334v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore, this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module, which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation, video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M), UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre consistency, and emotion consistency.</p></details> |  |

This innovation significantly simplifies the traditionally complex process of producing such content. Recent progress in text-to-image diffusion models has accelerated the rapid development in this emerging field. This survey presents a comprehensive review of text-driven 360-degree panorama generation, offering an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art algorithms. We extend our analysis to two closely related domains: text-driven 360-degree 3D scene generation and text-driven 360-degree panoramic video generation. Furthermore, we critically examine current limitations and propose promising directions for future research.

| **[MagCache: Fast Video Generation with Magnitude-Aware Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09045v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts. Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases monotonically, steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache) that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.10x-2.68x speedups on Open-Sora, CogVideoX, Wan 2.1, and HunyuanVideo, while preserving superior visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR, under similar computational budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zehong-ma.github.io/MagCache Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Unified Long Video Inpainting and Outpainting via Overlapping High-Order Co-Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03272v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding. To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences. In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks including editing or adding objects over hundreds of frames and demonstrate superior performance to baseline methods like Wan 2.1 model and VACE in terms of quality (PSNR/SSIM), and perceptual realism (LPIPS). Our method enables practical long-range video editing with minimal overhead, achieved a balance between parameter efficient and superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable Part Diffusion 4D: Multi-View RGB and Kinematic Parts Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10687v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K, a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream animation and motion-related tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Page:...</summary><p>Page: https://stablepartdiffusion4d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Video Super-Resolution: Towards Diffusion-Based Methods without Motion Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03355v5)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we rethink the approach to video super-resolution by introducing a method based on the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework, combined with an unconditional video diffusion transformer operating in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of diffusion-based, alignment-free video super-resolution.</p></details> | ICSPS 2025 |
| **[Genie Envisioner: A Unified World Foundation Platform for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05635v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Genie Envisioner (GE), a unified world foundation platform for robotic manipulation that integrates policy learning, evaluation, and simulation within a single video-generative framework. At its core, GE-Base is a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight, flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development. The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action alignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable and practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied intelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://genie-envisioner.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ID-Composer: Multi-Subject Video Synthesis with Hierarchical Identity Preservation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00511v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generative models pretrained on large-scale datasets can produce high-quality videos, but are often conditioned on text or a single image, limiting controllability and applicability. We introduce ID-Composer, a novel framework that addresses this gap by tackling multi-subject video generation from a text prompt and reference images. This task is challenging as it requires preserving subject identities, integrating semantics across subjects and modalities, and maintaining temporal consistency. To faithfully preserve the subject consistency and textual information in synthesized videos, ID-Composer designs a hierarchical identity-preserving attention mechanism, which effectively aggregates features within and across subjects and modalities. To effectively allow for the semantic following of user intention, we introduce semantic understanding via pretrained vision-language model (VLM), leveraging VLM's superior semantic understanding to provide fine-grained guidance and capture complex interactions between multiple subjects. Considering that standard diffusion loss often fails in aligning the critical concepts like subject ID, we employ an online reinforcement learning phase to drive the overall training objective of ID-Composer into RLVR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses existing methods in identity preservation, temporal consistency, and video quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Are Surgeons from Surgical World Models? A Pilot Study on Zero-shot Surgical Video Generation with Expert Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01775v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models in video generation are demonstrating remarkable capabilities as potential world models for simulating the physical world. However, their application in high-stakes domains like surgery, which demand deep, specialized causal knowledge rather than general physical rules, remains a critical unexplored gap. To systematically address this challenge, we present SurgVeo, the first expert-curated benchmark for video generation model evaluation in surgery, and the Surgical Plausibility Pyramid (SPP), a novel, four-tiered framework tailored to assess model outputs from basic appearance to complex surgical strategy. On the basis of the SurgVeo benchmark, we task the advanced Veo-3 model with a zero-shot prediction task on surgical clips from laparoscopic and neurosurgical procedures. A panel of four board-certified surgeons evaluates the generated videos according to the SPP. Our results reveal a distinct "plausibility gap": while Veo-3 achieves exceptional Visual Perceptual Plausibility, it fails critically at higher levels of the SPP, including Instrument Operation Plausibility, Environment Feedback Plausibility, and Surgical Intent Plausibility. This work provides the first quantitative evidence of the chasm between visually convincing mimicry and causal understanding in surgical AI. Our findings from SurgVeo and the SPP establish a crucial foundation and roadmap for developing future models capable of navigating the complexities of specialized, real-world healthcare domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Driving scenario generation and evaluation using a structured layer representation and foundational models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01541v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare and challenging driving scenarios are critical for autonomous vehicle development. Since they are difficult to encounter, simulating or generating them using generative models is a popular approach. Following previous efforts to structure driving scenario representations in a layer model, we propose a structured five-layer model to improve the evaluation and generation of rare scenarios. We use this model alongside large foundational models to generate new driving scenarios using a data augmentation strategy. Unlike previous representations, our structure introduces subclasses and characteristics for every agent of the scenario, allowing us to compare them using an embedding specific to our layer-model. We study and adapt two metrics to evaluate the relevance of a synthetic dataset in the context of a structured representation: the diversity score estimates how different the scenarios of a dataset are from one another, while the originality score calculates how similar a synthetic dataset is from a real reference set. This paper showcases both metrics in different generation setup, as well as a qualitative evaluation of synthetic videos generated from structured scenario descriptions. The code and extended results can be found at https://github.com/Valgiz/5LMSG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards One-step Causal Video Generation via Adversarial Self-Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01419v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent hybrid video generation models combine autoregressive temporal dynamics with diffusion-based spatial denoising, but their sequential, iterative nature leads to error accumulation and long inference times. In this work, we propose a distillation-based framework for efficient causal video generation that enables high-quality synthesis with extremely limited denoising steps. Our approach builds upon the Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) framework and proposes a novel Adversarial Self-Distillation (ASD) strategy, which aligns the outputs of the student model's n-step denoising process with its (n+1)-step version at the distribution level. This design provides smoother supervision by bridging small intra-student gaps and more informative guidance by combining teacher knowledge with locally consistent student behavior, substantially improving training stability and generation quality in extremely few-step scenarios (e.g., 1-2 steps). In addition, we present a First-Frame Enhancement (FFE) strategy, which allocates more denoising steps to the initial frames to mitigate error propagation while applying larger skipping steps to later frames. Extensive experiments on VBench demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in both one-step and two-step video generation. Notably, our framework produces a single distilled model that flexibly supports multiple inference-step settings, eliminating the need for repeated re-distillation and enabling efficient, high-quality video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under double-blind review as a conference paper</p></details> |
| **[MotionStream: Real-Time Video Generation with Interactive Motion Controls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01266v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current motion-conditioned video generation methods suffer from prohibitive latency (minutes per video) and non-causal processing that prevents real-time interaction. We present MotionStream, enabling sub-second latency with up to 29 FPS streaming generation on a single GPU. Our approach begins by augmenting a text-to-video model with motion control, which generates high-quality videos that adhere to the global text prompt and local motion guidance, but does not perform inference on the fly. As such, we distill this bidirectional teacher into a causal student through Self Forcing with Distribution Matching Distillation, enabling real-time streaming inference. Several key challenges arise when generating videos of long, potentially infinite time-horizons: (1) bridging the domain gap from training on finite length and extrapolating to infinite horizons, (2) sustaining high quality by preventing error accumulation, and (3) maintaining fast inference, without incurring growth in computational cost due to increasing context windows. A key to our approach is introducing carefully designed sliding-window causal attention, combined with attention sinks. By incorporating self-rollout with attention sinks and KV cache rolling during training, we properly simulate inference-time extrapolations with a fixed context window, enabling constant-speed generation of arbitrarily long videos. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results in motion following and video quality while being two orders of magnitude faster, uniquely enabling infinite-length streaming. With MotionStream, users can paint trajectories, control cameras, or transfer motion, and see results unfold in real-time, delivering a truly interactive experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://joonghyuk.com/motionstream-web/</p></details> |
| **[Diff4Splat: Controllable 4D Scene Generation with Latent Dynamic Reconstruction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00503v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Diff4Splat, a feed-forward method that synthesizes controllable and explicit 4D scenes from a single image. Our approach unifies the generative priors of video diffusion models with geometry and motion constraints learned from large-scale 4D datasets. Given a single input image, a camera trajectory, and an optional text prompt, Diff4Splat directly predicts a deformable 3D Gaussian field that encodes appearance, geometry, and motion, all in a single forward pass, without test-time optimization or post-hoc refinement. At the core of our framework lies a video latent transformer, which augments video diffusion models to jointly capture spatio-temporal dependencies and predict time-varying 3D Gaussian primitives. Training is guided by objectives on appearance fidelity, geometric accuracy, and motion consistency, enabling Diff4Splat to synthesize high-quality 4D scenes in 30 seconds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Diff4Splatacross video generation, novel view synthesis, and geometry extraction, where it matches or surpasses optimization-based methods for dynamic scene synthesis while being significantly more efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lost in Latent Space: An Empirical Study of Latent Diffusion Models for Physics Emulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02608v4)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phased DMD: Few-step Distribution Matching Distillation via Score Matching within Subintervals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27684v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However, limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency. While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative capabilities. We will release our code and models.</p></details> |  |

The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage, the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study, demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>video...</summary><p>video generation, image-to-video, dif- fusion transformer, LoRA, fine-tuning, cinematic scene synthesis, multi-GPU inference, fully sharded data parallelism, computational efficiency</p></details> |
| **[FantasyWorld: Geometry-Consistent World Modeling via Unified Video and 3D Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21657v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception, outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMD-Hummingbird: Towards an Efficient Text-to-Video Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18559v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Video (T2V) generation has attracted significant attention for its ability to synthesize realistic videos from textual descriptions. However, existing models struggle to balance computational efficiency and high visual quality, particularly on resource-limited devices, e.g.,iGPUs and mobile phones. Most prior work prioritizes visual fidelity while overlooking the need for smaller, more efficient models suitable for real-world deployment. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight T2V framework, termed Hummingbird, which prunes existing models and enhances visual quality through visual feedback learning. Our approach reduces the size of the U-Net from 1.4 billion to 0.7 billion parameters, significantly improving efficiency while preserving high-quality video generation. Additionally, we introduce a novel data processing pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models to enhance the quality of both text prompts and video data. To support user-driven training and style customization, we publicly release the full training code, including data processing and model training. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 31X speedup compared to state-of-the-art models such as VideoCrafter2, while also attaining the highest overall score on VBench. Moreover, our method supports the generation of videos with up to 26 frames, addressing the limitations of existing U-Net-based methods in long video generation. Notably, the entire training process requires only four GPUs, yet delivers performance competitive with existing leading methods. Hummingbird presents a practical and efficient solution for T2V generation, combining high performance, scalability, and flexibility for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/technical-articles/amd-hummingbird-0-9b-text-to-video-diffusion-model-with-4-step-inferencing.html| GitHub: https://github.com/AMD-AIG-AIMA/AMD-Hummingbird-T2V</p></details> |
| **[DANCER: Dance ANimation via Condition Enhancement and Rendering with diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27169v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks, human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and codes will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Training such models effectively requires large-scale datasets that capture the diversity and context of gaming environments. However, existing datasets are often limited to specific domains or rely on artificial degradations, which do not accurately capture the unique characteristics of gaming content. Moreover, benchmarks for controllable video generation remain absent. To address these limitations, we introduce $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$, a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-view dataset specifically designed to overcome the shortcomings of current resources. Unlike existing datasets, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides diverse, high-fidelity gaming content rendered with Unreal Engine 5, offering authentic ground-truth LR-HR paired and multi-view frames across 80 scenes in 8 categories. It includes $\mathtt{M^3VIR\_MR}$ for super-resolution (SR), novel view synthesis (NVS), and combined NVS+SR tasks, and $\mathtt{M^3VIR\_{MS}}$, the first multi-style, object-level ground-truth set enabling research on controlled video generation. Additionally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art SR and NVS methods to establish performance baselines. While no existing approaches directly handle controlled video generation, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides a benchmark for advancing this area. By releasing the dataset, we aim to facilitate research in AI-powered restoration, compression, and controllable content generation for next-generation cloud gaming and entertainment.</p></details> |  |

We present MOVAI (Multimodal Original Video AI), a novel hierarchical framework that integrates compositional scene understanding with temporal aware diffusion models for high fidelity text to video synthesis. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a Compositional Scene Parser (CSP) that decomposes textual descriptions into hierarchical scene graphs with temporal annotations, (2) a Temporal-Spatial Attention Mechanism (TSAM) that ensures coherent motion dynamics across frames while preserving spatial details, and (3) a Progressive Video Refinement (PVR) module that iteratively enhances video quality through multi-scale temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MOVAI achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving video quality metrics by 15.3% in LPIPS, 12.7% in FVD, and 18.9% in user preference studies compared to existing methods. Our framework shows particular strength in generating complex multi-object scenes with realistic temporal dynamics and fine-grained semantic control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Video Models Ready as Zero-Shot Reasoners? An Empirical Study with the MME-CoF Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26802v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study, we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Existing video-to-4D methods typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines, advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages; 21 figures; 3 tables; project page: https://see-4d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[The Quest for Generalizable Motion Generation: Data, Model, and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26794v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[HM-Talker: Hybrid Motion Modeling for High-Fidelity Talking Head Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10566v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads. HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-Evolving Latent Action World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26433v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM, while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning, establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation (LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos, LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc. Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical directions for future method improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Effects: Unified and Spatially-Controllable Visual Effects Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07981v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges, we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts (LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference. (2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of desired effects.</p></details> |  |

While existing caching strategies primarily focus on reducing local heuristic errors, they often overlook the accumulation of global errors, leading to noticeable content degradation between accelerated and original videos. To address this issue, we formulate cache scheduling as a directed graph with error-weighted edges and introduce a Lexicographic Minimax Path Optimization strategy that explicitly bounds the worst-case path error. This approach substantially improves the consistency of global content and style across generated frames. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate that LeMiCa delivers dual improvements in both inference speed and generation quality. Notably, our method achieves a 2.9x speedup on the Latte model and reaches an LPIPS score of 0.05 on Open-Sora, outperforming prior caching techniques. Importantly, these gains come with minimal perceptual quality degradation, making LeMiCa a robust and generalizable paradigm for accelerating diffusion-based video generation. We believe this approach can serve as a strong foundation for future research on efficient and reliable video synthesis.

In this paper, we present GameFactory, a framework for action-controlled scene-generalizable game video generation. We first address the fundamental challenge of action controllability by introducing GF-Minecraft, an action-annotated game video dataset without human bias, and developing an action control module that enables precise control over both keyboard and mouse inputs. We further extend to support autoregressive generation for unlimited-length interactive videos. More importantly, GameFactory tackles the critical challenge of scene-generalizable action control, which most existing methods fail to address. To enable the creation of entirely new and diverse games beyond fixed styles and scenes, we leverage the open-domain generative priors from pre-trained video diffusion models. To bridge the domain gap between open-domain priors and small-scale game datasets, we propose a multi-phase training strategy with a domain adapter that decouples game style learning from action control. This decoupling ensures that action control learning is no longer bound to specific game styles, thereby achieving scene-generalizable action control. Experimental results demonstrate that GameFactory effectively generates open-domain action-controllable game videos, representing a significant step forward in AI-driven game generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Highlight, Project Page: https://yujiwen.github.io/gamefactory</p></details> |
| **[Learning World Models for Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21996v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational world models must be both interactive and preserve spatiotemporal coherence for effective future planning with action choices. However, present models for long video generation have limited inherent world modeling capabilities due to two main challenges: compounding errors and insufficient memory mechanisms. We enhance image-to-video models with interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context learning capabilities of current video models. Our work illuminates the fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/vrag</p></details> |

Most methods tacking this problem rely on providing user-defined controls, such as binary masks or camera movement embeddings. In our approach we propose OnlyFlow, an approach leveraging the optical flow firstly extracted from an input video to condition the motion of generated videos. Using a text prompt and an input video, OnlyFlow allows the user to generate videos that respect the motion of the input video as well as the text prompt. This is implemented through an optical flow estimation model applied on the input video, which is then fed to a trainable optical flow encoder. The output feature maps are then injected into the text-to-video backbone model. We perform quantitative, qualitative and user preference studies to show that OnlyFlow positively compares to state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of tasks, even though OnlyFlow was not specifically trained for such tasks. OnlyFlow thus constitutes a versatile, lightweight yet efficient method for controlling motion in text-to-video generation.

However, strategies for optimizing video captions specifically for T2V training remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce VC4VG (Video Captioning for Video Generation), a comprehensive caption optimization framework tailored to the needs of T2V models. We begin by analyzing caption content from a T2V perspective, decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with T2V-specific requirements. Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Prevailing methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task, enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a comprehensive dataset to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page URL:https://libaolu312.github.io/VFXMaster/</p></details> |

We expose a fundamental flaw in this approach by introducing Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel attack that bypasses these safeguards by exploiting phonetic memorization. The APT attack replaces iconic lyrics with homophonic but semantically unrelated alternatives (e.g., "mom's spaghetti" becomes "Bob's confetti"), preserving acoustic structure while altering meaning; we identify high-fidelity phonetic matches using CMU pronouncing dictionary. We demonstrate that leading Lyrics-to-Song (L2S) models like SUNO and YuE regenerate songs with striking melodic and rhythmic similarity to their copyrighted originals when prompted with these altered lyrics. More surprisingly, this vulnerability extends across modalities. When prompted with phonetically modified lyrics from a song, a Text-to-Video (T2V) model like Veo 3 reconstructs visual scenes from the original music video-including specific settings and character archetypes-despite the absence of any visual cues in the prompt. Our findings reveal that models memorize deep, structural patterns tied to acoustics, not just verbatim text. This phonetic-to-visual leakage represents a critical vulnerability in transcript-conditioned generative models, rendering simple copyright filters ineffective and raising urgent concerns about the secure deployment of multimodal AI systems. Demo examples are available at our project page (https://jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).</p></details> |  |

However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

These capabilities enable more reliable synthetic data generation, policy evaluation, and closed-loop simulation for robotics and autonomous systems. We further extend the family with [Cosmos-Transfer2.5], a control-net style framework for Sim2Real and Real2Real world translation.

The challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data. Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity.

In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation. Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion methods.

To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD, a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations, all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR decoding, without any degradation in output quality.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches for personalizing text-to-video generation suffer from tackling multiple subjects, which is a more challenging and practical scenario. In this work, our aim is to promote multi-subject guided text-to-video customization. We propose CustomVideo, a novel framework that can generate identity-preserving videos with the guidance of multiple subjects. To be specific, firstly, we encourage the co-occurrence of multiple subjects via composing them in a single image. Further, upon a basic text-to-video diffusion model, we design a simple yet effective attention control strategy to disentangle different subjects in the latent space of diffusion model. Moreover, to help the model focus on the specific area of the object, we segment the object from given reference images and provide a corresponding object mask for attention learning. Also, we collect a multi-subject text-to-video generation dataset as a comprehensive benchmark. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user study results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation Guided by Simple yet Effective Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04705v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.

| **[Improving Video Generation with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13918v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has achieved significant advances through rectified flow techniques, but issues like unsmooth motion and misalignment between videos and prompts persist. In this work, we develop a systematic pipeline that harnesses human feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation model. Specifically, we begin by constructing a large-scale human preference dataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise annotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, a multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models. These include two training-time strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom weights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video quality needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VideoAlign</p></details> |
| **[CoMo: Compositional Motion Customization for Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23007v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for $\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation, enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video. CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second, in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video generation.

However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we propose S$^2$Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for V-DMs that leverages Salient data and Sparse token distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs. Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6 quantization, S$^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering $3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration.

Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark. Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation, and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value in downstream tasks.

Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

While recent methods improve audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency, identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation. To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation. MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames. Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy, offering a robust solution for talking face generation.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces three innovations to improve multi-agent collaboration. First, we propose OmniAgent, a hierarchical, graph-based multi-agent framework for long video generation that leverages a film-production-inspired architecture to enable modular specialization and scalable inter-agent collaboration. Second, inspired by context engineering, we propose hypergraph nodes that enable temporary group discussions among agents lacking sufficient context, reducing individual memory requirements while ensuring adequate contextual information. Third, we transition from directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to directed cyclic graphs with limited retries, allowing agents to reflect and refine outputs iteratively, thereby improving earlier stages through feedback from subsequent nodes. These contributions lay the groundwork for developing more robust multi-agent systems in creative tasks.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5 neural function evaluations (NFE). Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy, genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2 million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with significantly fewer inference steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figure, 2 tables, accepted at Neurips 2025</p></details> |

However, generating multiple videos with consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images. Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training, offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without relying on reference images or additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wolfball.github.io/bachvid</p></details> |
| **[Epipolar Geometry Improves Video Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21615v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially consistent videos without compromising visual quality.</p></details> |  |

Existing models, however, are typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences, imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability, while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through occupancy-grounded rewards.

We identify and quantify this critical issue, demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes, RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%, narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for AD development.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://flow-inference-time-scaling.github.io/ (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

To support this task, we introduce a new dataset that is curated semi-automatically, an efficient identity-preserving motion-controllable video Diffusion Transformer architecture, and a comprehensive evaluation protocol targeting this task. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either introduce artifacts by enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval. To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://bytedance.github.io/Video-As-Prompt</p></details> |

This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models, and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter efficient, and interpretable approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the implicit scene understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows and inter-reflections. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape, and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or ray-tracing. .

| **[Identity-Preserving Image-to-Video Generation via Reward-Guided Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14255v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

However, it can sometimes be limited to specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework. To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading other performance compared to the previous method.</p></details> | 17 pages |

We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1}, Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++ achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic, cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt optimization in T2V generation.

For I2V, we leverage start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters. Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior.

To achieve this, we augment 2D videos with 3D point trajectories and align them in pixel space. The resulting 3D-aware video dataset, PointVid, is then used to fine-tune a latent diffusion model, enabling it to track 2D objects with 3D Cartesian coordinates.

Consequently, we enhance the quality of generated RGB videos and alleviate common issues like object morphing, which are prevalent in current video models due to a lack of shape awareness. With our 3D augmentation and regularization, our model is capable of handling contact-rich scenarios such as task-oriented videos, where 3D information is essential for perceiving shape and motion of interacting solids.

Insurance fraud is a pervasive and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims. Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave of fraud.</p></details> |  |

These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video generation.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet, intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process. We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.</p></details> | 2 pages |
| **[PoseCrafter: Extreme Pose Estimation with Hybrid Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19527v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

However, training large-scale video generation models remains particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii) training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations. More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights, Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node scaling, details are available in https://github.com/Shopee-MUG/MUG-V.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; Project Page: https://github.com/Shopee-MUG/MUG-V</p></details> |

The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain0.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[FeatureFool: Zero-Query Fooling of Video Models via Feature Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18362v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover, no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy, video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniVideo: Unified Understanding, Generation, and Editing for Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08377v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we will release our model and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website https://congwei1230.github.io/UniVideo/</p></details> |
| **[UltraGen: High-Resolution Video Generation with Hierarchical Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18775v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation, entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs (<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K) impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically, UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoGA: Mixture-of-Groups Attention for End-to-End Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18692v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps, with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Kaleido: Open-Sourced Multi-Subject Reference Video Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18573v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models, existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances. In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline, incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V generation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Progress on this question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to substantially improve closed-loop performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/World-In-World/world-in-world</p></details> |

This work answers the question of when and why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM. The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.</p></details> |  |

This could revolutionize applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and scientific simulation. However, before treating these models as world models, we must ask: Do they adhere to physical conservation laws? To answer this, we introduce Morpheus, a benchmark for evaluating video generation models on physical reasoning. It features 80 real-world videos capturing physical phenomena, guided by conservation laws. Since artificial generations lack ground truth, we assess physical plausibility using physics-informed metrics evaluated with respect to infallible conservation laws known per physical setting, leveraging advances in physics-informed neural networks and vision-language foundation models. Our findings reveal that even with advanced prompting and video conditioning, current models struggle to encode physical principles despite generating aesthetically pleasing videos.

| **[From Preferences to Prejudice: The Role of Alignment Tuning in Shaping Social Bias in Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17247v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced text-to-video generation, particularly through alignment tuning using reward models trained on human preferences. While these methods improve visual quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline, we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes (gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity, (3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4) the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.</p></details> |  |

It has a key role in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks, Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Long-duration Talking Video Synthesis with Linear Diffusion Transformer under Multimodal Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16748v4)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-duration talking video synthesis faces enduring challenges in achieving high video quality, portrait and temporal consistency, and computational efficiency. As video length increases, issues such as visual degradation, identity inconsistency, temporal incoherence, and error accumulation become increasingly problematic, severely affecting the realism and reliability of the results. To address these challenges, we present LetsTalk, a diffusion transformer framework equipped with multimodal guidance and a novel memory bank mechanism, explicitly maintaining contextual continuity and enabling robust, high-quality, and efficient generation of long-duration talking videos. In particular, LetsTalk introduces a noise-regularized memory bank to alleviate error accumulation and sampling artifacts during extended video generation. To further improve efficiency and spatiotemporal consistency, LetsTalk employs a deep compression autoencoder and a spatiotemporal-aware transformer with linear attention for effective multimodal fusion. We systematically analyze three fusion schemes and show that combining deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait features and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio achieves superior visual realism and precise speech-driven motion, while preserving diversity of movements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LetsTalk establishes new state-of-the-art in generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic talking videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, and maintains remarkable efficiency with 8x fewer parameters than previous approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins. We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular, M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising. Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

We trace two practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps) often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance; and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse, user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB \(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, model, and demos can be found at https://envision-research.github.io/STANCE/</p></details> |

Existing test-time optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation, the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual, audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.</p></details> |  |

At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of one million high-fidelity video editing examples.

Current approaches to driving scene synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction. Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency.

Prior work shows that adding localized text control signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings, offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles, pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion. Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with prior approaches.

| **[Multi-identity Human Image Animation with Structural Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04126v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating human videos from a single image while ensuring high visual quality and precise control is a challenging task, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple individuals and interactions with objects. Existing methods, while effective for single-human cases, often fail to handle the intricacies of multi-identity interactions because they struggle to associate the correct pairs of human appearance and pose condition and model the distribution of 3D-aware dynamics. To address these limitations, we present \emph{Structural Video Diffusion}, a novel framework designed for generating realistic multi-human videos. Our approach introduces two core innovations: identity-specific embeddings to maintain consistent appearances across individuals and a structural learning mechanism that incorporates depth and surface-normal cues to model human-object interactions. Additionally, we expand existing human video dataset with 25K new videos featuring diverse multi-human and object interaction scenarios, providing a robust foundation for training. Experimental results demonstrate that Structural Video Diffusion achieves superior performance in generating lifelike, coherent videos for multiple subjects with dynamic and rich interactions, advancing the state of human-centric video generation.

| **[ChronoEdit: Towards Temporal Reasoning for Image Editing and World Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04290v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large generative models have greatly enhanced both image editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, target frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical plausibility.

| **[RealDPO: Real or Not Real, that is the Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14955v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code:https://github.com/Vchitect/RealDPO Project Page:https://vchitect.github.io/RealDPO-Project/</p></details> |
| **[DialectGen: Benchmarking and Improving Dialect Robustness in Multimodal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14949v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200 unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Scene Prompting for Scene-Consistent Camera-Controllable Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14945v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality.

| **[Ctrl-VI: Controllable Video Synthesis via Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07670v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed input formats. We develop Ctrl-VI, a video synthesis method that addresses this need and generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to prior works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://video-synthesis-variational.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Attention Surgery: An Efficient Recipe to Linearize Your Video Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24899v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly retraining. We introduce Attention Surgery, an efficient framework for linearizing or hybridizing attention in pretrained VDMs without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models, our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers. Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models, reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.

| **[In-Context Learning with Unpaired Clips for Instruction-based Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14648v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality. Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2025, project page: https://nxnai.github.io/Voost/</p></details> |
