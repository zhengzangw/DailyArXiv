| **[VidTwin: Video VAE with Decoupled Structure and Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17726v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video autoencoders (Video AEs) have significantly improved the quality and efficiency of video generation. In this paper, we propose a novel and compact video autoencoder, VidTwin, that decouples video into two distinct latent spaces: Structure latent vectors, which capture overall content and global movement, and Dynamics latent vectors, which represent fine-grained details and rapid movements. Specifically, our approach leverages an Encoder-Decoder backbone, augmented with two submodules for extracting these latent spaces, respectively. The first submodule employs a Q-Former to extract low-frequency motion trends, followed by downsampling blocks to remove redundant content details. The second averages the latent vectors along the spatial dimension to capture rapid motion. Extensive experiments show that VidTwin achieves a high compression rate of 0.20% with high reconstruction quality (PSNR of 28.14 on the MCL-JCV dataset), and performs efficiently and effectively in downstream generative tasks. Moreover, our model demonstrates explainability and scalability, paving the way for future research in video latent representation and generation.

| **[Zero4D: Training-Free 4D Video Generation From Single Video Using Off-the-Shelf Video Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22622v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multi-view or 4D video generation has emerged as a significant research topic. Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zero4dvid.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Stabilized and Efficient Diffusion Transformers through Long-Skip-Connections with Spectral Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17616v3)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, a novel DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration without quality loss and high fidelity to original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish long-skip connections as critical architectural components for training stable and efficient diffusion transformers.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[EchoFlow: A Foundation Model for Cardiac Ultrasound Image and Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22357v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced medical image analysis, yet the availability of large-scale medical datasets remains constrained by patient privacy concerns. We present EchoFlow, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality, privacy-preserving synthetic echocardiogram images and videos. EchoFlow comprises four key components: an adversarial variational autoencoder for defining an efficient latent representation of cardiac ultrasound images, a latent image flow matching model for generating accurate latent echocardiogram images, a latent re-identification model to ensure privacy by filtering images anatomically, and a latent video flow matching model for animating latent images into realistic echocardiogram videos conditioned on ejection fraction. We rigorously evaluate our synthetic datasets on the clinically relevant task of ejection fraction regression and demonstrate, for the first time, that downstream models trained exclusively on EchoFlow-generated synthetic datasets achieve performance parity with models trained on real datasets. We release our models and synthetic datasets, enabling broader, privacy-compliant research in medical ultrasound imaging at https://huggingface.co/spaces/HReynaud/EchoFlow.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[CoGen: 3D Consistent Video Generation via Adaptive Conditioning for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22231v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in driving video generation has shown significant potential for enhancing self-driving systems by providing scalable and controllable training data. Although pretrained state-of-the-art generation models, guided by 2D layout conditions (e.g., HD maps and bounding boxes), can produce photorealistic driving videos, achieving controllable multi-view videos with high 3D consistency remains a major challenge. To tackle this, we introduce a novel spatial adaptive generation framework, CoGen, which leverages advances in 3D generation to improve performance in two key aspects: (i) To ensure 3D consistency, we first generate high-quality, controllable 3D conditions that capture the geometry of driving scenes. By replacing coarse 2D conditions with these fine-grained 3D representations, our approach significantly enhances the spatial consistency of the generated videos. (ii) Additionally, we introduce a consistency adapter module to strengthen the robustness of the model to multi-condition control. The results demonstrate that this method excels in preserving geometric fidelity and visual realism, offering a reliable video generation solution for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can video generation replace cinematographers? Research on the cinematic language of generated video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12223v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have leveraged diffusion models to enhance visual coherence in videos synthesized from textual descriptions. However, existing research primarily focuses on object motion, often overlooking cinematic language, which is crucial for conveying emotion and narrative pacing in cinematography. To address this, we propose a threefold approach to improve cinematic control in T2V models. First, we introduce a meticulously annotated cinematic language dataset with twenty subcategories, covering shot framing, shot angles, and camera movements, enabling models to learn diverse cinematic styles. Second, we present CameraDiff, which employs LoRA for precise and stable cinematic control, ensuring flexible shot generation. Third, we propose CameraCLIP, designed to evaluate cinematic alignment and guide multi-shot composition. Building on CameraCLIP, we introduce CLIPLoRA, a CLIP-guided dynamic LoRA composition method that adaptively fuses multiple pre-trained cinematic LoRAs, enabling smooth transitions and seamless style blending. Experimental results demonstrate that CameraDiff ensures stable and precise cinematic control, CameraCLIP achieves an R@1 score of 0.83, and CLIPLoRA significantly enhances multi-shot composition within a single video, bridging the gap between automated video generation and professional cinematography.\textsuperscript{1}</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Motion Prompting: Controlling Video Generation with Motion Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02700v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion control is crucial for generating expressive and compelling video content; however, most existing video generation models rely mainly on text prompts for control, which struggle to capture the nuances of dynamic actions and temporal compositions. To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance.

| **[VideoMage: Multi-Subject and Motion Customization of Text-to-Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21781v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customized text-to-video generation aims to produce high-quality videos that incorporate user-specified subject identities or motion patterns. However, existing methods mainly focus on personalizing a single concept, either subject identity or motion pattern, limiting their effectiveness for multiple subjects with the desired motion patterns. To tackle this challenge, we propose a unified framework VideoMage for video customization over both multiple subjects and their interactive motions. VideoMage employs subject and motion LoRAs to capture personalized content from user-provided images and videos, along with an appearance-agnostic motion learning approach to disentangle motion patterns from visual appearance. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-temporal composition scheme to guide interactions among subjects within the desired motion patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoMage outperforms existing methods, generating coherent, user-controlled videos with consistent subject identities and interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Exploring the Evolution of Physics Cognition in Video Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21765v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have witnessed significant progress, especially with the rapid advancement of diffusion models. Despite this, their deficiencies in physical cognition have gradually received widespread attention - generated content often violates the fundamental laws of physics, falling into the dilemma of ''visual realism but physical absurdity". Researchers began to increasingly recognize the importance of physical fidelity in video generation and attempted to integrate heuristic physical cognition such as motion representations and physical knowledge into generative systems to simulate real-world dynamic scenarios. Considering the lack of a systematic overview in this field, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive summary of architecture designs and their applications to fill this gap. Specifically, we discuss and organize the evolutionary process of physical cognition in video generation from a cognitive science perspective, while proposing a three-tier taxonomy: 1) basic schema perception for generation, 2) passive cognition of physical knowledge for generation, and 3) active cognition for world simulation, encompassing state-of-the-art methods, classical paradigms, and benchmarks. Subsequently, we emphasize the inherent key challenges in this domain and delineate potential pathways for future research, contributing to advancing the frontiers of discussion in both academia and industry. Through structured review and interdisciplinary analysis, this survey aims to provide directional guidance for developing interpretable, controllable, and physically consistent video generation paradigms, thereby propelling generative models from the stage of ''visual mimicry'' towards a new phase of ''human-like physical comprehension''.</p></details> | <details><summary>A com...</summary><p>A comprehensive list of papers studied in this survey is available at https://github.com/minnie-lin/Awesome-Physics-Cognition-based-Video-Generation</p></details> |
| **[VBench-2.0: Advancing Video Generation Benchmark Suite for Intrinsic Faithfulness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21755v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has advanced significantly, evolving from producing unrealistic outputs to generating videos that appear visually convincing and temporally coherent. To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored for individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as state-of-the-art VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive annotations to ensure alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors.

| **[TripoSG: High-Fidelity 3D Shape Synthesis using Large-Scale Rectified Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06608v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion techniques have propelled image and video generation to unprecedented levels of quality, significantly accelerating the deployment and application of generative AI. However, 3D shape generation technology has so far lagged behind, constrained by limitations in 3D data scale, complexity of 3D data processing, and insufficient exploration of advanced techniques in the 3D domain. Current approaches to 3D shape generation face substantial challenges in terms of output quality, generalization capability, and alignment with input conditions. We present TripoSG, a new streamlined shape diffusion paradigm capable of generating high-fidelity 3D meshes with precise correspondence to input images. Specifically, we propose: 1) A large-scale rectified flow transformer for 3D shape generation, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity through training on extensive, high-quality data. 2) A hybrid supervised training strategy combining SDF, normal, and eikonal losses for 3D VAE, achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction performance. 3) A data processing pipeline to generate 2 million high-quality 3D samples, highlighting the crucial rules for data quality and quantity in training 3D generative models. Through comprehensive experiments, we have validated the effectiveness of each component in our new framework. The seamless integration of these parts has enabled TripoSG to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape generation. The resulting 3D shapes exhibit enhanced detail due to high-resolution capabilities and demonstrate exceptional fidelity to input images. Moreover, TripoSG demonstrates improved versatility in generating 3D models from diverse image styles and contents, showcasing strong generalization capabilities. To foster progress and innovation in the field of 3D generation, we will make our model publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Audio-driven Gesture Generation via Deviation Feature in the Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21616v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gestures are essential for enhancing co-speech communication, offering visual emphasis and complementing verbal interactions. While prior work has concentrated on point-level motion or fully supervised data-driven methods, we focus on co-speech gestures, advocating for weakly supervised learning and pixel-level motion deviations. We introduce a weakly supervised framework that learns latent representation deviations, tailored for co-speech gesture video generation. Our approach employs a diffusion model to integrate latent motion features, enabling more precise and nuanced gesture representation. By leveraging weakly supervised deviations in latent space, we effectively generate hand gestures and mouth movements, crucial for realistic video production. Experiments show our method significantly improves video quality, surpassing current state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ScalingNoise: Scaling Inference-Time Search for Generating Infinite Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16400v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (VDMs) facilitate the generation of high-quality videos, with current research predominantly concentrated on scaling efforts during training through improvements in data quality, computational resources, and model complexity. However, inference-time scaling has received less attention, with most approaches restricting models to a single generation attempt. Recent studies have uncovered the existence of "golden noises" that can enhance video quality during generation. Building on this, we find that guiding the scaling inference-time search of VDMs to identify better noise candidates not only evaluates the quality of the frames generated in the current step but also preserves the high-level object features by referencing the anchor frame from previous multi-chunks, thereby delivering long-term value. Our analysis reveals that diffusion models inherently possess flexible adjustments of computation by varying denoising steps, and even a one-step denoising approach, when guided by a reward signal, yields significant long-term benefits. Based on the observation, we proposeScalingNoise, a plug-and-play inference-time search strategy that identifies golden initial noises for the diffusion sampling process to improve global content consistency and visual diversity. Specifically, we perform one-step denoising to convert initial noises into a clip and subsequently evaluate its long-term value, leveraging a reward model anchored by previously generated content. Moreover, to preserve diversity, we sample candidates from a tilted noise distribution that up-weights promising noises. In this way, ScalingNoise significantly reduces noise-induced errors, ensuring more coherent and spatiotemporally consistent video generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed ScalingNoise effectively improves long video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Diffusion Acceleration with Bottleneck Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18940v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual content generation but remain challenging to deploy due to their high computational cost during inference. This computational burden primarily arises from the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video resolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality or necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are pre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these low-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading performance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free framework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead while preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high denoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and final stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To mitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution transition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage. We evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where extensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to 3$\times$ for image generation and 2.5$\times$ for video generation, all while maintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling process across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tyfeld.github.io/BottleneckSampling.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Video Tokenization: A Conditioned Diffusion-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03708v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video tokenizers typically use the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture for video compression and reconstruction. However, to achieve good performance, its training process often relies on complex multi-stage training tricks that go beyond basic reconstruction loss and KL regularization. Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise tuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate higher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel Conditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based decoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses spatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder reconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these latents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate videos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt sampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a basic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS perceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a single-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\times$ inference speedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent video generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The source code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/ali-vilab/CDT.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatAnyone: Stylized Real-time Portrait Video Generation with Hierarchical Motion Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21144v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time interactive video-chat portraits have been increasingly recognized as the future trend, particularly due to the remarkable progress made in text and voice chat technologies. However, existing methods primarily focus on real-time generation of head movements, but struggle to produce synchronized body motions that match these head actions. Additionally, achieving fine-grained control over the speaking style and nuances of facial expressions remains a challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework for stylized real-time portrait video generation, enabling expressive and flexible video chat that extends from talking head to upper-body interaction. Our approach consists of the following two stages. The first stage involves efficient hierarchical motion diffusion models, that take both explicit and implicit motion representations into account based on audio inputs, which can generate a diverse range of facial expressions with stylistic control and synchronization between head and body movements. The second stage aims to generate portrait video featuring upper-body movements, including hand gestures. We inject explicit hand control signals into the generator to produce more detailed hand movements, and further perform face refinement to enhance the overall realism and expressiveness of the portrait video. Additionally, our approach supports efficient and continuous generation of upper-body portrait video in maximum 512 * 768 resolution at up to 30fps on 4090 GPU, supporting interactive video-chat in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of our approach to produce portrait videos with rich expressiveness and natural upper-body movements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://humanaigc.github.io/chat-anyone/</p></details> |
| **[VideoHandles: Editing 3D Object Compositions in Videos Using Video Generative Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01107v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative methods for image and video editing use generative models as priors to perform edits despite incomplete information, such as changing the composition of 3D objects shown in a single image. Recent methods have shown promising composition editing results in the image setting, but in the video setting, editing methods have focused on editing object's appearance and motion, or camera motion, and as a result, methods to edit object composition in videos are still missing. We propose \name as a method for editing 3D object compositions in videos of static scenes with camera motion. Our approach allows editing the 3D position of a 3D object across all frames of a video in a temporally consistent manner. This is achieved by lifting intermediate features of a generative model to a 3D reconstruction that is shared between all frames, editing the reconstruction, and projecting the features on the edited reconstruction back to each frame. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative approach to edit object compositions in videos. Our approach is simple and training-free, while outperforming state-of-the-art image editing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://videohandles.github.io</p></details> |

Inspired by this success, we investigate whether video generators similarly exhibit 3D-awareness. Using structure-from-motion as a 3D-aware task, we test if intermediate features of a video generator - OpenSora in our case - can support camera pose estimation. Surprisingly, at first, we only find a weak correlation between the two tasks. Deeper investigation reveals that although the video generator produces plausible video frames, the frames themselves are not truly 3D-consistent. Instead, we propose to jointly train for the two tasks, using photometric generation and 3D aware errors. Specifically, we find that SoTA video generation and camera pose estimation (i.e.,DUSt3R [79]) networks share common structures, and propose an architecture that unifies the two. The proposed unified model, named \nameMethod, produces camera pose estimates with competitive quality while producing 3D-consistent videos. In summary, we propose the first unified video generator that is 3D-consistent, generates realistic video frames, and can potentially be repurposed for other 3D-aware tasks.</p></details> |  |

While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</p></details> |  |

We introduce GAIA-2, Generative AI for Autonomy, a latent diffusion world model that unifies these capabilities within a single generative framework. GAIA-2 supports controllable video generation conditioned on a rich set of structured inputs: ego-vehicle dynamics, agent configurations, environmental factors, and road semantics. It generates high-resolution, spatiotemporally consistent multi-camera videos across geographically diverse driving environments (UK, US, Germany). The model integrates both structured conditioning and external latent embeddings (e.g., from a proprietary driving model) to facilitate flexible and semantically grounded scene synthesis. Through this integration, GAIA-2 enables scalable simulation of both common and rare driving scenarios, advancing the use of generative world models as a core tool in the development of autonomous systems.

| **[VPO: Aligning Text-to-Video Generation Models with Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20491v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video tasks. These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly detailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs during inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes prompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods often rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context learning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent, omit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize prompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can lead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a principled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles: harmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully preserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of generated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization approach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset based on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both text-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with preference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO significantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to baseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video generation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be combined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the effectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/VPO.</p></details> |  |

Copyrighted characters (e.g., Mario, Batman) present a significant challenge: at least one lawsuit has already awarded damages based on the generation of such characters. Consequently, commercial services like DALL-E have started deploying interventions. However, little research has systematically examined these problems: (1) Can users easily prompt models to generate copyrighted characters, even if it is unintentional?; (2) How effective are the existing mitigation strategies? To address these questions, we introduce a novel evaluation framework with metrics that assess both the generated image's similarity to copyrighted characters and its consistency with user intent, grounded in a set of popular copyrighted characters from diverse studios and regions. We show that state-of-the-art image and video generation models can still generate characters even if characters' names are not explicitly mentioned, sometimes with only two generic keywords (e.g., prompting with "videogame, plumber" consistently generates Nintendo's Mario character). We also introduce semi-automatic techniques to identify such keywords or descriptions that trigger character generation. Using this framework, we evaluate mitigation strategies, including prompt rewriting and new approaches we propose. Our findings reveal that common methods, such as DALL-E's prompt rewriting, are insufficient alone and require supplementary strategies like negative prompting. Our work provides empirical grounding for discussions on copyright mitigation strategies and offers actionable insights for model deployers implementing these safeguards.</p></details> |  |

Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://flow-inference-time-scaling.github.io/</p></details> |

People prefer to get an appropriate sticker through retrieval rather than creation for the reason that creating a sticker is time-consuming and relies on rule-based creative tools with limited capabilities. Nowadays, advanced text-to-video algorithms have spawned numerous general video generation systems that allow users to customize high-quality, photo-realistic videos by only providing simple text prompts. However, creating customized animated stickers, which have lower frame rates and more abstract semantics than videos, is greatly hindered by difficulties in data acquisition and incomplete benchmarks. To facilitate the exploration of researchers in animated sticker generation (ASG) field, we firstly construct the currently largest vision-language sticker dataset named VSD2M at a two-million scale that contains static and animated stickers. Secondly, to improve the performance of traditional video generation methods on ASG tasks with discrete characteristics, we propose a Spatial Temporal Interaction (STI) layer that utilizes semantic interaction and detail preservation to address the issue of insufficient information utilization. Moreover, we train baselines with several video generation methods (e.g., transformer-based, diffusion-based methods) on VSD2M and conduct a detailed analysis to establish systemic supervision on ASG task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive large-scale benchmark for multi-frame animated sticker generation, and we hope this work can provide valuable inspiration for other scholars in intelligent creation.</p></details> |  |

However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; 21 pages, 23 figures, Project page: https://onevfall.github.io/project_page/ditctrl ; GitHub repository: https://github.com/TencentARC/DiTCtrl</p></details> |

Previous video generation models often had limited movement and short durations, and is difficult to generate videos with coherent narratives based on text. We propose several designs to address these issues. First, we propose a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions, to improve both compression rate and video fidelity. Second, to improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the two modalities. Third, by employing a progressive training and multi-resolution frame pack technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration, different shape videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method, greatly contributing to the generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show that CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple machine metrics and human evaluations.

Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://agnjason.github.io/HumanDiT-page/</p></details> |

However, this rapid advancement raises significant privacy and security concerns, particularly regarding the unauthorized use of personal video data in automated annotation by video-based LLMs. These unauthorized annotated video-text pairs can then be used to improve the performance of downstream tasks, such as text-to-video generation. To safeguard personal videos from unauthorized use, we propose two series of protective video watermarks with imperceptible adversarial perturbations, named Ramblings and Mutes. Concretely, Ramblings aim to mislead video-based LLMs into generating inaccurate captions for the videos, thereby degrading the quality of video annotations through inconsistencies between video content and captions. Mutes, on the other hand, are designed to prompt video-based LLMs to produce exceptionally brief captions, lacking descriptive detail. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our video watermarking methods effectively protect video data by significantly reducing video annotation performance across various video-based LLMs, showcasing both stealthiness and robustness in protecting personal video content.

Although significant progress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all methods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context utilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower generation speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (Dynamic frame Avatar With Non-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once generation of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two main components: (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the latent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid videos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements. Additionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation capabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These results highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the field of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks further exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Hanbo-Cheng/DAWN-pytorch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unconditional Priors Matter! Improving Conditional Generation of Fine-Tuned Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20240v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a fundamental technique in training conditional diffusion models. The common practice for CFG-based training is to use a single network to learn both conditional and unconditional noise prediction, with a small dropout rate for conditioning. However, we observe that the joint learning of unconditional noise with limited bandwidth in training results in poor priors for the unconditional case. More importantly, these poor unconditional noise predictions become a serious reason for degrading the quality of conditional generation. Inspired by the fact that most CFG-based conditional models are trained by fine-tuning a base model with better unconditional generation, we first show that simply replacing the unconditional noise in CFG with that predicted by the base model can significantly improve conditional generation. Furthermore, we show that a diffusion model other than the one the fine-tuned model was trained on can be used for unconditional noise replacement. We experimentally verify our claim with a range of CFG-based conditional models for both image and video generation, including Zero-1-to-3, Versatile Diffusion, DiT, DynamiCrafter, and InstructPix2Pix.</p></details> |  |

Using a reference video and conditional signals such as music or motion tags, the system synthesizes new videos by first retrieving video clips with gestures matching the conditions and then generating interpolation frames to seamlessly connect clip boundaries. The core of our approach is HMInterp, a robust Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) model that enables seamless interpolation of discontinuous frames, even for complex motion scenarios like dancing. HMInterp i) employs a dual-branch interpolation approach, combining a Motion Diffusion Model for human skeleton motion interpolation with a diffusion-based video frame interpolation model for final frame generation. ii) adopts condition progressive training to effectively leverage identity strong and weak conditions, such as images and pose. These designs ensure both high video texture quality and accurate motion trajectory. Results show that our Video Motion Graphs outperforms existing generative- and retrieval-based methods for multi-modal conditioned human motion video generation.

Existing motion transfer methods explored the motion representations of reference videos to guide generation. Nevertheless, these methods typically rely on sample-specific optimization strategy, resulting in high computational burdens. In this paper, we propose EfficientMT, a novel and efficient end-to-end framework for video motion transfer. By leveraging a small set of synthetic paired motion transfer samples, EfficientMT effectively adapts a pretrained T2V model into a general motion transfer framework that can accurately capture and reproduce diverse motion patterns. Specifically, we repurpose the backbone of the T2V model to extract temporal information from reference videos, and further propose a scaler module to distill motion-related information. Subsequently, we introduce a temporal integration mechanism that seamlessly incorporates reference motion features into the video generation process. After training on our self-collected synthetic paired samples, EfficientMT enables general video motion transfer without requiring test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EfficientMT outperforms existing methods in efficiency while maintaining flexible motion controllability.

These rendered videos respect real-world physics, such as maintaining 3D consistency, and serve as a valuable resource that can potentially improve video generation models. To harness this potential, we propose a solution that curates and integrates synthetic data while introducing a method to transfer its physical realism to the model, significantly reducing unwanted artifacts. Through experiments on three representative tasks emphasizing physical consistency, we demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing physical fidelity. While our model still lacks a deep understanding of physics, our work offers one of the first empirical demonstrations that synthetic video enhances physical fidelity in video synthesis.

However, acquiring 3D HOI data is challenging due to its complexity and high cost, limiting existing methods to the narrow diversity of object types and interaction patterns in training datasets. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot HOI synthesis framework without relying on end-to-end training on currently limited 3D HOI datasets. The core idea of our method lies in leveraging extensive HOI knowledge from pre-trained Multimodal Models. Given a text description, our system first obtains temporally consistent 2D HOI image sequences using image or video generation models, which are then uplifted to 3D HOI milestones of human and object poses. We employ pre-trained human pose estimation models to extract human poses and introduce a generalizable category-level 6-DoF estimation method to obtain the object poses from 2D HOI images. Our estimation method is adaptive to various object templates obtained from text-to-3D models or online retrieval. A physics-based tracking of the 3D HOI kinematic milestone is further applied to refine both body motions and object poses, yielding more physically plausible HOI generation results. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating open-vocabulary HOIs with physical realism and semantic diversity.</p></details> |  |

It is an important task in video generation but remains an open problem for generative models. This paper pushes the technical frontier of IPT2V in two directions that have not been resolved in literature: (1) A tuning-free pipeline without tedious case-by-case finetuning, and (2) A frequency-aware heuristic identity-preserving DiT-based control scheme. We propose ConsisID, a tuning-free DiT-based controllable IPT2V model to keep human identity consistent in the generated video. Inspired by prior findings in frequency analysis of diffusion transformers, it employs identity-control signals in the frequency domain, where facial features can be decomposed into low-frequency global features and high-frequency intrinsic features. First, from a low-frequency perspective, we introduce a global facial extractor, which encodes reference images and facial key points into a latent space, generating features enriched with low-frequency information. These features are then integrated into shallow layers of the network to alleviate training challenges associated with DiT. Second, from a high-frequency perspective, we design a local facial extractor to capture high-frequency details and inject them into transformer blocks, enhancing the model's ability to preserve fine-grained features. We propose a hierarchical training strategy to leverage frequency information for identity preservation, transforming a vanilla pre-trained video generation model into an IPT2V model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our frequency-aware heuristic scheme provides an optimal control solution for DiT-based models. Thanks to this scheme, our ConsisID generates high-quality, identity-preserving videos, making strides towards more effective IPT2V.

Although adapter-based approaches (e.g., ControlNet) enable additional controls with minimal fine-tuning, they encounter challenges when integrating multiple conditions, including: branch conflicts between independently trained adapters, parameter redundancy leading to increased computational cost, and suboptimal performance compared to full fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we introduce FullDiT, a unified foundation model for video generation that seamlessly integrates multiple conditions via unified full-attention mechanisms. By fusing multi-task conditions into a unified sequence representation and leveraging the long-context learning ability of full self-attention to capture condition dynamics, FullDiT reduces parameter overhead, avoids conditions conflict, and shows scalability and emergent ability. We further introduce FullBench for multi-task video generation evaluation.

However, the more challenging task of multi-scene video generation, which offers broader applications, remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Mask$^2$DiT, a novel approach that establishes fine-grained, one-to-one alignment between video segments and their corresponding text annotations. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric binary mask at each attention layer within the DiT architecture, ensuring that each text annotation applies exclusively to its respective video segment while preserving temporal coherence across visual tokens. This attention mechanism enables precise segment-level textual-to-visual alignment, allowing the DiT architecture to effectively handle video generation tasks with a fixed number of scenes. To further equip the DiT architecture with the ability to generate additional scenes based on existing ones, we incorporate a segment-level conditional mask, which conditions each newly generated segment on the preceding video segments, thereby enabling auto-regressive scene extension. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm that Mask$^2$DiT excels in maintaining visual consistency across segments while ensuring semantic alignment between each segment and its corresponding text description.

This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables geometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core capabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video prediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved feature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across reconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video generation models, our framework demonstrates unprecedented synthetic-to-real generalization despite never observing real-world data during training. Furthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action following and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling. Remarkably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance is comparable with or even better than that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether employs camera trajectories as geometry-informed action spaces, enabling effective action-conditioned prediction and visual planning.

Despite the promising progress made in the field, it remains a challenging and critical problem to generate videos with accurate poses and fine-grained facial details simultaneously. Essentially, facial motion is often highly complex to model precisely, and the one-shot source face image cannot provide sufficient appearance guidance during generation due to dynamic pose changes. To tackle the problem, we propose to jointly learn motion and appearance codebooks and perform multi-scale codebook compensation to effectively refine both the facial motion conditions and appearance features for talking face image decoding. Specifically, the designed multi-scale motion and appearance codebooks are learned simultaneously in a unified framework to store representative global facial motion flow and appearance patterns. Then, we present a novel multi-scale motion and appearance compensation module, which utilizes a transformer-based codebook retrieval strategy to query complementary information from the two codebooks for joint motion and appearance compensation. The entire process produces motion flows of greater flexibility and appearance features with fewer distortions across different scales, resulting in a high-quality talking head video generation framework. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate superior generation results from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives when compared to state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

However, their iterative denoising nature requires a large number of inference steps to generate a video, which is slow and computationally expensive. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis of the challenges present in existing diffusion distillation methods and propose a novel efficient method, namely AccVideo, to reduce the inference steps for accelerating video diffusion models with synthetic dataset. We leverage the pretrained video diffusion model to generate multiple valid denoising trajectories as our synthetic dataset, which eliminates the use of useless data points during distillation. Based on the synthetic dataset, we design a trajectory-based few-step guidance that utilizes key data points from the denoising trajectories to learn the noise-to-video mapping, enabling video generation in fewer steps. Furthermore, since the synthetic dataset captures the data distribution at each diffusion timestep, we introduce an adversarial training strategy to align the output distribution of the student model with that of our synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing the video quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves 8.5x improvements in generation speed compared to the teacher model while maintaining comparable performance. Compared to previous accelerating methods, our approach is capable of generating videos with higher quality and resolution, i.e., 5-seconds, 720x1280, 24fps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aejion.github.io/accvideo/</p></details> |

Among various physical processes requiring proper representation, radiation plays a fundamental role as it drives Earth's weather and climate systems. However, accurate simulation of radiative transfer processes remains challenging for traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models due to their inherent complexity and high computational costs. Here, we propose FuXi-RTM, a hybrid physics-guided deep learning framework designed to enhance weather forecast accuracy while enforcing physical consistency. FuXi-RTM integrates a primary forecasting model (FuXi) with a fixed deep learning-based radiative transfer model (DLRTM) surrogate that efficiently replaces conventional radiation parameterization schemes. This represents the first deep learning-based weather forecasting framework to explicitly incorporate physical process modeling. Evaluated over a comprehensive 5-year dataset, FuXi-RTM outperforms its unconstrained counterpart in 88.51% of 3320 variable and lead time combinations, with improvements in radiative flux predictions. By incorporating additional physical processes, FuXi-RTM paves the way for next-generation weather forecasting systems that are both accurate and physically consistent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Re-HOLD: Video Hand Object Interaction Reenactment via adaptive Layout-instructed Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16942v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current digital human studies focusing on lip-syncing and body movement are no longer sufficient to meet the growing industrial demand, while human video generation techniques that support interacting with real-world environments (e.g., objects) have not been well investigated. Despite human hand synthesis already being an intricate problem, generating objects in contact with hands and their interactions presents an even more challenging task, especially when the objects exhibit obvious variations in size and shape. To tackle these issues, we present a novel video Reenactment framework focusing on Human-Object Interaction (HOI) via an adaptive Layout-instructed Diffusion model (Re-HOLD). Our key insight is to employ specialized layout representation for hands and objects, respectively. Such representations enable effective disentanglement of hand modeling and object adaptation to diverse motion sequences. To further improve the generation quality of HOI, we design an interactive textural enhancement module for both hands and objects by introducing two independent memory banks. We also propose a layout adjustment strategy for the cross-object reenactment scenario to adaptively adjust unreasonable layouts caused by diverse object sizes during inference. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods.

| **[MVPortrait: Text-Guided Motion and Emotion Control for Multi-view Vivid Portrait Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19383v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent portrait animation methods have made significant strides in generating realistic lip synchronization. However, they often lack explicit control over head movements and facial expressions, and cannot produce videos from multiple viewpoints, resulting in less controllable and expressive animations. Moreover, text-guided portrait animation remains underexplored, despite its user-friendly nature. We present a novel two-stage text-guided framework, MVPortrait (Multi-view Vivid Portrait), to generate expressive multi-view portrait animations that faithfully capture the described motion and emotion. MVPortrait is the first to introduce FLAME as an intermediate representation, effectively embedding facial movements, expressions, and view transformations within its parameter space. In the first stage, we separately train the FLAME motion and emotion diffusion models based on text input. In the second stage, we train a multi-view video generation model conditioned on a reference portrait image and multi-view FLAME rendering sequences from the first stage. Experimental results exhibit that MVPortrait outperforms existing methods in terms of motion and emotion control, as well as view consistency. Furthermore, by leveraging FLAME as a bridge, MVPortrait becomes the first controllable portrait animation framework that is compatible with text, speech, and video as driving signals.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Hardware-Friendly Static Quantization Method for Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15077v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers for video generation have gained significant research interest since the impressive performance of SORA. Efficient deployment of such generative-AI models on GPUs has been demonstrated with dynamic quantization. However, resource-constrained devices cannot support dynamic quantization, and need static quantization of the models for their efficient deployment on AI processors. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the post-training quantization of OpenSora\cite{opensora}, a Video Diffusion Transformer, without relying on dynamic quantization techniques. Our approach employs static quantization, achieving video quality comparable to FP16 and dynamically quantized ViDiT-Q methods, as measured by CLIP, and VQA metrics. In particular, we utilize per-step calibration data to adequately provide a post-training statically quantized model for each time step, incorporating channel-wise quantization for weights and tensor-wise quantization for activations. By further applying the smooth-quantization technique, we can obtain high-quality video outputs with the statically quantized models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that static quantization can be a viable alternative to dynamic quantization for video diffusion transformers, offering a more efficient approach without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Context Autoregressive Video Modeling with Next-Frame Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19325v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language generation, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended temporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce Frame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive modeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens (i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous frames, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion transformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context vision modeling faces challenges due to visual redundancy. Existing RoPE lacks effective temporal decay for remote context and fails to extrapolate well to long video sequences. Additionally, training on long videos is computationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose balancing locality and long-range dependency. We introduce FlexRoPE, an test-time technique that adds flexible temporal decay to RoPE, enabling extrapolation to 16x longer vision contexts. Furthermore, we propose long short-term context modeling, where a high-resolution short-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet effective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://farlongctx.github.io/</p></details> |

In this paper, we present GameFactory, a framework for action-controlled scene-generalizable game video generation. We first address the fundamental challenge of action controllability by introducing GF-Minecraft, a action-annotated game video dataset without human bias, and developing a action control module that enables precise control over both keyboard and mouse inputs. We further extend to support autoregressive generation for unlimited-length interactive videos. More importantly, GameFactory tackles the critical challenge of scene-generalizable action control, which most existing methods fail to address. To enable the creation of entirely new and diverse games beyond fixed styles and scenes, we leverage the open-domain generative priors from pre-trained video diffusion models. To bridge the domain gap between open-domain priors and small-scale game datasets, we propose a multi-phase training strategy with a domain adapter that decouples game style learning from action control. This decoupling ensures that action control learning is no longer bound to specific game styles, thereby achieving scene-generalizable action control. Experimental results demonstrate that GameFactory effectively generates open-domain action-controllable game videos, representing a significant step forward in AI-driven game generation.

| **[Improved Training Technique for Latent Consistency Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01441v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistency models are a new family of generative models capable of producing high-quality samples in either a single step or multiple steps. Recently, consistency models have demonstrated impressive performance, achieving results on par with diffusion models in the pixel space. However, the success of scaling consistency training to large-scale datasets, particularly for text-to-image and video generation tasks, is determined by performance in the latent space. In this work, we analyze the statistical differences between pixel and latent spaces, discovering that latent data often contains highly impulsive outliers, which significantly degrade the performance of iCT in the latent space. To address this, we replace Pseudo-Huber losses with Cauchy losses, effectively mitigating the impact of outliers. Additionally, we introduce a diffusion loss at early timesteps and employ optimal transport (OT) coupling to further enhance performance. Lastly, we introduce the adaptive scaling-$c$ scheduler to manage the robust training process and adopt Non-scaling LayerNorm in the architecture to better capture the statistics of the features and reduce outlier impact. With these strategies, we successfully train latent consistency models capable of high-quality sampling with one or two steps, significantly narrowing the performance gap between latent consistency and diffusion models.

However, existing models struggle to balance computational efficiency and high visual quality, particularly on resource-limited devices, e.g.,iGPUs and mobile phones. Most prior work prioritizes visual fidelity while overlooking the need for smaller, more efficient models suitable for real-world deployment. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight T2V framework, termed Hummingbird, which prunes existing models and enhances visual quality through visual feedback learning. Our approach reduces the size of the U-Net from 1.4 billion to 0.7 billion parameters, significantly improving efficiency while preserving high-quality video generation. Additionally, we introduce a novel data processing pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models to enhance the quality of both text prompts and video data. To support user-driven training and style customization, we publicly release the full training code, including data processing and model training. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 31X speedup compared to state-of-the-art models such as VideoCrafter2, while also attaining the highest overall score on VBench. Moreover, our method supports the generation of videos with up to 26 frames, addressing the limitations of existing U-Net-based methods in long video generation. Notably, the entire training process requires only four GPUs, yet delivers performance competitive with existing leading methods. Hummingbird presents a practical and efficient solution for T2V generation, combining high performance, scalability, and flexibility for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/technical-articles/amd-hummingbird-0-9b-text-to-video-diffusion-model-with-4-step-inferencing.html| GitHub: https://github.com/AMD-AIG-AIMA/AMD-Hummingbird-T2V</p></details> |
| **[Zeroth-order Informed Fine-Tuning for Diffusion Model: A Recursive Likelihood Ratio Optimizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00639v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The probabilistic diffusion model (DM), generating content by inferencing through a recursive chain structure, has emerged as a powerful framework for visual generation. After pre-training on enormous unlabeled data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a zeroth-order informed fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The zeroth-order gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with the lower variance than other methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of the RLR. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation tasks to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.</p></details> |  |

FloVD leverages optical flow to represent the motions of the camera and moving objects. This approach offers two key benefits. Since optical flow can be directly estimated from videos, our approach allows for the use of arbitrary training videos without ground-truth camera parameters. Moreover, as background optical flow encodes 3D correlation across different viewpoints, our method enables detailed camera control by leveraging the background motion. To synthesize natural object motion while supporting detailed camera control, our framework adopts a two-stage video synthesis pipeline consisting of optical flow generation and flow-conditioned video synthesis.

Despite their impressive capabilities, current Video-LMMs have not been evaluated for anomaly detection tasks, which is critical to their deployment in practical scenarios e.g., towards identifying deepfakes, manipulated video content, traffic accidents and crimes. In this paper, we introduce VANE-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the proficiency of Video-LMMs in detecting and localizing anomalies and inconsistencies in videos. Our dataset comprises an array of videos synthetically generated using existing state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, encompassing a variety of subtle anomalies and inconsistencies grouped into five categories: unnatural transformations, unnatural appearance, pass-through, disappearance and sudden appearance. Additionally, our benchmark features real-world samples from existing anomaly detection datasets, focusing on crime-related irregularities, atypical pedestrian behavior, and unusual events. The task is structured as a visual question-answering challenge to gauge the models' ability to accurately detect and localize the anomalies within the videos. We evaluate nine existing Video-LMMs, both open and closed sources, on this benchmarking task and find that most of the models encounter difficulties in effectively identifying the subtle anomalies. In conclusion, our research offers significant insights into the current capabilities of Video-LMMs in the realm of anomaly detection, highlighting the importance of our work in evaluating and improving these models for real-world applications.

| **[Video-T1: Test-Time Scaling for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18942v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the scale capability of increasing training data, model size, and computational cost, video generation has achieved impressive results in digital creation, enabling users to express creativity across various domains. Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more inference-time computation. Instead of scaling up video foundation models through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target video distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching process. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs, we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute consistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.

| **[CAGE: Unsupervised Visual Composition and Animation for Controllable Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14368v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of video generation has expanded significantly in recent years, with controllable and compositional video generation garnering considerable interest. Most methods rely on leveraging annotations such as text, objects' bounding boxes, and motion cues, which require substantial human effort and thus limit their scalability. In contrast, we address the challenge of controllable and compositional video generation without any annotations by introducing a novel unsupervised approach. Our model is trained from scratch on a dataset of unannotated videos. At inference time, it can compose plausible novel scenes and animate objects by placing object parts at the desired locations in space and time. The core innovation of our method lies in the unified control format and the training process, where video generation is conditioned on a randomly selected subset of pre-trained self-supervised local features. This conditioning compels the model to learn how to inpaint the missing information in the video both spatially and temporally, thereby learning the inherent compositionality of a scene and the dynamics of moving objects. The abstraction level and the imposed invariance of the conditioning input to minor visual perturbations enable control over object motion by simply using the same features at all the desired future locations. We call our model CAGE, which stands for visual Composition and Animation for video GEneration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of CAGE across various scenarios, demonstrating its capability to accurately follow the control and to generate high-quality videos that exhibit coherent scene composition and realistic animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI2025; Project website: https://araachie.github.io/cage</p></details> |
| **[EvAnimate: Event-conditioned Image-to-Video Generation for Human Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18552v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional human animation transforms a static reference image into a dynamic sequence by applying motion cues such as poses. These motion cues are typically derived from video data but are susceptible to limitations including low temporal resolution, motion blur, overexposure, and inaccuracies under low-light conditions. In contrast, event cameras provide data streams with exceptionally high temporal resolution, a wide dynamic range, and inherent resistance to motion blur and exposure issues. In this work, we propose EvAnimate, a framework that leverages event streams as motion cues to animate static human images. Our approach employs a specialized event representation that transforms asynchronous event streams into 3-channel slices with controllable slicing rates and appropriate slice density, ensuring compatibility with diffusion models. Subsequently, a dual-branch architecture generates high-quality videos by harnessing the inherent motion dynamics of the event streams, thereby enhancing both video quality and temporal consistency. Specialized data augmentation strategies further enhance cross-person generalization. Finally, we establish a new benchmarking, including simulated event data for training and validation, and a real-world event dataset capturing human actions under normal and extreme scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate that EvAnimate achieves high temporal fidelity and robust performance in scenarios where traditional video-derived cues fall short.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Text-to-Video Generation help Video-Language Alignment?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18507v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video-language alignment models are trained on sets of videos, each with an associated positive caption and a negative caption generated by large language models. A problem with this procedure is that negative captions may introduce linguistic biases, i.e., concepts are seen only as negatives and never associated with a video. While a solution would be to collect videos for the negative captions, existing databases lack the fine-grained variations needed to cover all possible negatives. In this work, we study whether synthetic videos can help to overcome this issue. Our preliminary analysis with multiple generators shows that, while promising on some tasks, synthetic videos harm the performance of the model on others. We hypothesize this issue is linked to noise (semantic and visual) in the generated videos and develop a method, SynViTA, that accounts for those. SynViTA dynamically weights the contribution of each synthetic video based on how similar its target caption is w.r.t. the real counterpart. Moreover, a semantic consistency loss makes the model focus on fine-grained differences across captions, rather than differences in video appearance. Experiments show that, on average, SynViTA improves over existing methods on VideoCon test sets and SSv2-Temporal, SSv2-Events, and ATP-Hard benchmarks, being a first promising step for using synthetic videos when learning video-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Beyond the challenge of lengthy animation times, a critical challenge in realistic talking head generation lies in preserving the natural movement of diverse body parts. To this end, we propose Teller, the first streaming audio-driven protrait animation framework with autoregressive motion generation. Specifically, Teller first decomposes facial and body detail animation into two components: Facial Motion Latent Generation (FMLG) based on an autoregressive transfromer, and movement authenticity refinement using a Efficient Temporal Module (ETM).Concretely, FMLG employs a Residual VQ model to map the facial motion latent from the implicit keypoint-based model into discrete motion tokens, which are then temporally sliced with audio embeddings. This enables the AR tranformer to learn real-time, stream-based mappings from audio to motion. Furthermore, Teller incorporate ETM to capture finer motion details. This module ensures the physical consistency of body parts and accessories, such as neck muscles and earrings, improving the realism of these movements. Teller is designed to be efficient, surpassing the inference speed of diffusion-based models (Hallo 20.93s vs. Teller 0.92s for one second video generation), and achieves a real-time streaming performance of up to 25 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent audio-driven portrait animation models, especially in small movements, as validated by human evaluations with a significant margin in quality and realism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept in CVPR 2025 Conference Submission</p></details> |

However, current text-to-video generation models still face significant challenges such as high training costs, substantial data requirements, and difficulties in maintaining consistency between given text and motion of the foreground object. To address these challenges, we propose mask-guided video generation, which can control video generation through mask motion sequences, while requiring limited training data. Our model enhances existing architectures by incorporating foreground masks for precise text-position matching and motion trajectory control. Through mask motion sequences, we guide the video generation process to maintain consistent foreground objects throughout the sequence. Additionally, through a first-frame sharing strategy and autoregressive extension approach, we achieve more stable and longer video generation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that this approach excels in various video generation tasks, such as video editing and generating artistic videos, outperforming previous methods in terms of consistency and quality.

Text-to-video generation has made remarkable progress over the past year, but the absence of harmonious audio in generated video limits its broader applications. In this paper, we propose Semantic and Temporal Aligned Video-to-Audio (STA-V2A), an approach that enhances audio generation from videos by extracting both local temporal and global semantic video features and combining these refined video features with text as cross-modal guidance. To address the issue of information redundancy in videos, we propose an onset prediction pretext task for local temporal feature extraction and an attentive pooling module for global semantic feature extraction. To supplement the insufficient semantic information in videos, we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with Text-to-Audio priors initialization and cross-modal guidance.

However, existing controlled diffusion transformer methods incur significant parameter and computational overheads and suffer from inefficient resource allocation due to their failure to account for the varying relevance of control information across different transformer layers. To address this, we propose the Relevance-Guided Efficient Controllable Generation framework, RelaCtrl, enabling efficient and resource-optimized integration of control signals into the Diffusion Transformer. First, we evaluate the relevance of each layer in the Diffusion Transformer to the control information by assessing the "ControlNet Relevance Score"-i.e., the impact of skipping each control layer on both the quality of generation and the control effectiveness during inference. Based on the strength of the relevance, we then tailor the positioning, parameter scale, and modeling capacity of the control layers to reduce unnecessary parameters and redundant computations. Additionally, to further improve efficiency, we replace the self-attention and FFN in the commonly used copy block with the carefully designed Two-Dimensional Shuffle Mixer (TDSM), enabling efficient implementation of both the token mixer and channel mixer. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance with only 15% of the parameters and computational complexity compared to PixArt-delta.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://360cvgroup.github.io/RelaCtrl/ Github: https://github.com/360CVGroup/RelaCtrl</p></details> |

Furthermore, we propose a multi-dimensional consistent strategy when using VisionReward as a reward model during preference optimization for visual generation. Experiments show that VisionReward can significantly outperform existing image and video reward models on both machine metrics and human evaluation.

Within diffusion frameworks, guidance techniques have proven effective in enhancing output quality during inference; however, applying these methods to video diffusion models introduces additional complexity of handling computations across entire sequences. To address this, we propose a novel framework called MotionPrompt that guides the video generation process via optical flow. Specifically, we train a discriminator to distinguish optical flow between random pairs of frames from real videos and generated ones. Given that prompts can influence the entire video, we optimize learnable token embeddings during reverse sampling steps by using gradients from a trained discriminator applied to random frame pairs. This approach allows our method to generate visually coherent video sequences that closely reflect natural motion dynamics, without compromising the fidelity of the generated content.

However, generating RGBA videos with alpha channels for transparency and visual effects remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of suitable datasets and the complexity of adapting existing models for this purpose. To address these limitations, we present TransAnimate, an innovative framework that integrates RGBA image generation techniques with video generation modules, enabling the creation of dynamic and transparent videos. TransAnimate efficiently leverages pre-trained text-to-transparent image model weights and combines them with temporal models and controllability plugins trained on RGB videos, adapting them for controllable RGBA video generation tasks. Additionally, we introduce an interactive motion-guided control mechanism, where directional arrows define movement and colors adjust scaling, offering precise and intuitive control for designing game effects. To further alleviate data scarcity, we have developed a pipeline for creating an RGBA video dataset, incorporating high-quality game effect videos, extracted foreground objects, and synthetic transparent videos. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TransAnimate generates high-quality RGBA videos, establishing it as a practical and effective tool for applications in gaming and visual effects.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing models lack fine-grained control over camera movement, which is critical for downstream applications related to content creation, visual effects, and 3D vision. Recently, new methods demonstrate the ability to generate videos with controllable camera poses these techniques leverage pre-trained U-Net-based diffusion models that explicitly disentangle spatial and temporal generation. Still, no existing approach enables camera control for new, transformer-based video diffusion models that process spatial and temporal information jointly. Here, we propose to tame video transformers for 3D camera control using a ControlNet-like conditioning mechanism that incorporates spatiotemporal camera embeddings based on Pl\"ucker coordinates. The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for controllable video generation after fine-tuning on the RealEstate10K dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to enable camera control for transformer-based video diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; Project Page: https://snap-research.github.io/vd3d/</p></details> |
| **[AC3D: Analyzing and Improving 3D Camera Control in Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18673v3)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous works have recently integrated 3D camera control into foundational text-to-video models, but the resulting camera control is often imprecise, and video generation quality suffers. In this work, we analyze camera motion from a first principles perspective, uncovering insights that enable precise 3D camera manipulation without compromising synthesis quality. First, we determine that motion induced by camera movements in videos is low-frequency in nature. This motivates us to adjust train and test pose conditioning schedules, accelerating training convergence while improving visual and motion quality. Then, by probing the representations of an unconditional video diffusion transformer, we observe that they implicitly perform camera pose estimation under the hood, and only a sub-portion of their layers contain the camera information. This suggested us to limit the injection of camera conditioning to a subset of the architecture to prevent interference with other video features, leading to a 4x reduction of training parameters, improved training speed, and 10% higher visual quality. Finally, we complement the typical dataset for camera control learning with a curated dataset of 20K diverse, dynamic videos with stationary cameras. This helps the model distinguish between camera and scene motion and improves the dynamics of generated pose-conditioned videos. We compound these findings to design the Advanced 3D Camera Control (AC3D) architecture, the new state-of-the-art model for generative video modeling with camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project Page: https://snap-research.github.io/ac3d/</p></details> |
| **[RDTF: Resource-efficient Dual-mask Training Framework for Multi-frame Animated Sticker Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17735v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, great progress has been made in video generation technology, attracting the widespread attention of scholars. To apply this technology to downstream applications under resource-constrained conditions, researchers usually fine-tune the pre-trained models based on parameter-efficient tuning methods such as Adapter or Lora. Although these methods can transfer the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, fewer training parameters lead to poor fitting ability, and the knowledge from the source domain may lead to the inference process deviating from the target domain. In this paper, we argue that under constrained resources, training a smaller video generation model from scratch using only million-level samples can outperform parameter-efficient tuning on larger models in downstream applications: the core lies in the effective utilization of data and curriculum strategy. Take animated sticker generation (ASG) as a case study, we first construct a discrete frame generation network for stickers with low frame rates, ensuring that its parameters meet the requirements of model training under constrained resources. In order to provide data support for models trained from scratch, we come up with a dual-mask based data utilization strategy, which manages to improve the availability and expand the diversity of limited data. To facilitate convergence under dual-mask situation, we propose a difficulty-adaptive curriculum learning method, which decomposes the sample entropy into static and adaptive components so as to obtain samples from easy to difficult. The experiment demonstrates that our resource-efficient dual-mask training framework is quantitatively and qualitatively superior to efficient-parameter tuning methods such as I2V-Adapter and SimDA, verifying the feasibility of our method on downstream tasks under constrained resources. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Diffusion Transformers are In-Context Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10783v3)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates a solution for enabling in-context capabilities of video diffusion transformers, with minimal tuning required for activation. Specifically, we propose a simple pipeline to leverage in-context generation: ($\textbf{i}$) concatenate videos along spacial or time dimension, ($\textbf{ii}$) jointly caption multi-scene video clips from one source, and ($\textbf{iii}$) apply task-specific fine-tuning using carefully curated small datasets. Through a series of diverse controllable tasks, we demonstrate qualitatively that existing advanced text-to-video models can effectively perform in-context generation. Notably, it allows for the creation of consistent multi-scene videos exceeding 30 seconds in duration, without additional computational overhead. Importantly, this method requires no modifications to the original models, results in high-fidelity video outputs that better align with prompt specifications and maintain role consistency. Our framework presents a valuable tool for the research community and offers critical insights for advancing product-level controllable video generation systems.

| **[Generating, Fast and Slow: Scalable Parallel Video Generation with Video Interface Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17539v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) can generate short photorealistic videos, yet directly training and sampling longer videos with full attention across the video remains computationally challenging. Alternative methods break long videos down into sequential generation of short video segments, requiring multiple sampling chain iterations and specialized consistency modules. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new paradigm called Video Interface Networks (VINs), which augment DiTs with an abstraction module to enable parallel inference of video chunks. At each diffusion step, VINs encode global semantics from the noisy input of local chunks and the encoded representations, in turn, guide DiTs in denoising chunks in parallel. The coupling of VIN and DiT is learned end-to-end on the denoising objective. Further, the VIN architecture maintains fixed-size encoding tokens that encode the input via a single cross-attention step. Disentangling the encoding tokens from the input thus enables VIN to scale to long videos and learn essential semantics. Experiments on VBench demonstrate that VINs surpass existing chunk-based methods in preserving background consistency and subject coherence. We then show via an optical flow analysis that our approach attains state-of-the-art motion smoothness while using 25-40% fewer FLOPs than full generation. Finally, human raters favorably assessed the overall video quality and temporal consistency of our method in a user study.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing methods cannot synthesize interactions in unseen environments such as in-the-wild scenes or reconstructed scenes, as they rely on paired 3D scenes and captured human motion data for training, which are unavailable for unseen environments. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis, eliminating the need for training on any MoCap data. Our key insight is to distill human-scene interactions from state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/ The first two authors contribute equally</p></details> |

Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 16 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.

We propose a novel self-supervised framework for generating drawing processes from any type of image, treating the task as a video generation problem. Our approach reverses the drawing process by progressively removing strokes from a reference image, simulating a human-like creation sequence. Crucially, our method does not require costly datasets of real human drawing processes; instead, we leverage depth estimation and stroke rendering to construct a self-supervised dataset. We model human drawings as "refinement" and "layering" processes and introduce depth fusion layers to enable video generation models to learn and replicate human drawing behavior. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to generate realistic drawings without the need for real drawing process data.</p></details> |  |

Block-sparse attention mitigates this by focusing computation on critical regions, yet existing methods struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency due to costly block importance measurements. In this paper, we introduce XAttention, a plug-and-play framework that dramatically accelerates long-context inference in Transformers models using sparse attention. XAttention's key innovation is the insight that the sum of antidiagonal values (i.e., from the lower-left to upper-right) in the attention matrix provides a powerful proxy for block importance. This allows for precise identification and pruning of non-essential blocks, resulting in high sparsity and dramatically accelerated inference. Across comprehensive evaluations on demanding long-context benchmarks-including RULER and LongBench for language, VideoMME for video understanding, and VBench for video generation. XAttention achieves accuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial computational gains. We demonstrate up to 13.5x acceleration in attention computation. These results underscore XAttention's ability to unlock the practical potential of block sparse attention, paving the way for scalable and efficient deployment of LCTMs in real-world applications.

However, existing methods often focus on limited domains, require time-consuming optimization per subject, or support only a single subject. We present Video Alchemist $-$ a video model with built-in multi-subject, open-set personalization capabilities for both foreground objects and background, eliminating the need for time-consuming test-time optimization. Our model is built on a new Diffusion Transformer module that fuses each conditional reference image and its corresponding subject-level text prompt with cross-attention layers. Developing such a large model presents two main challenges: dataset and evaluation. First, as paired datasets of reference images and videos are extremely hard to collect, we sample selected video frames as reference images and synthesize a clip of the target video. However, while models can easily denoise training videos given reference frames, they fail to generalize to new contexts. To mitigate this issue, we design a new automatic data construction pipeline with extensive image augmentations. Second, evaluating open-set video personalization is a challenge in itself. To address this, we introduce a personalization benchmark that focuses on accurate subject fidelity and supports diverse personalization scenarios. Finally, our extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing personalization methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects.

VGoT generates multi-shot videos that outperform state-of-the-art baselines by 20.4% in within-shot face consistency and 17.4% in style consistency, while achieving over 100% better cross-shot consistency and 10x fewer manual adjustments than alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper should be a refined version of arXiv:2412.02259, "VideoGen-of-Thought: A Collaborative Framework for Multi-Shot Video Generation", but I mistakenly submit it as a new paper</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose merging these two fields by utilizing image-to-video models for image editing. We reformulate image editing as a temporal process, using pretrained video models to create smooth transitions from the original image to the desired edit. This approach traverses the image manifold continuously, ensuring consistent edits while preserving the original image's key aspects.

To generate diverse camera poses and unbounded spatial extent of real-world scenes, while ensuring generalization to arbitrary text prompts, previous methods fine-tune 2D generative models to jointly model camera poses and multi-view images. However, these methods suffer from instability when extending 2D generative models to joint modeling due to the modality gap, which necessitates additional models to stabilize training and inference. In this work, we propose an architecture and a sampling strategy to jointly model multi-view images and camera poses when fine-tuning a video generation model. Our core idea is a dual-stream architecture that attaches a dedicated pose generation model alongside a pre-trained video generation model via communication blocks, generating multi-view images and camera poses through separate streams. This design reduces interference between the pose and image modalities. Additionally, we propose an asynchronous sampling strategy that denoises camera poses faster than multi-view images, allowing rapidly denoised poses to condition multi-view generation, reducing mutual ambiguity and enhancing cross-modal consistency. Trained on multiple large-scale real-world datasets (RealEstate10K, MVImgNet, DL3DV-10K, ACID), VideoRFSplat outperforms existing text-to-3D direct generation methods that heavily depend on post-hoc refinement via score distillation sampling, achieving superior results without such refinement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gohyojun15.github.io/VideoRFSplat/</p></details> |

However, these models often generate videos that have misalignments with text prompts, especially when the prompts describe complex scenes with multiple objects and attributes. To address this, we introduce VideoRepair, a novel model-agnostic, training-free video refinement framework that automatically identifies fine-grained text-video misalignments and generates explicit spatial and textual feedback, enabling a T2V diffusion model to perform targeted, localized refinements. VideoRepair consists of two stages: In (1) video refinement planning, we first detect misalignments by generating fine-grained evaluation questions and answering them using an MLLM. Based on video evaluation outputs, we identify accurately generated objects and construct localized prompts to precisely refine misaligned regions. In (2) localized refinement, we enhance video alignment by 'repairing' the misaligned regions from the original video while preserving the correctly generated areas.

However, existing methods still struggle with accurately binding attributes, determining spatial relationships, and capturing complex action interactions between multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we propose MagicComp, a training-free method that enhances compositional T2V generation through dual-phase refinement. Specifically, (1) During the Conditioning Stage: We introduce the Semantic Anchor Disambiguation to reinforces subject-specific semantics and resolve inter-subject ambiguity by progressively injecting the directional vectors of semantic anchors into original text embedding; (2) During the Denoising Stage: We propose Dynamic Layout Fusion Attention, which integrates grounding priors and model-adaptive spatial perception to flexibly bind subjects to their spatiotemporal regions through masked attention modulation. Furthermore, MagicComp is a model-agnostic and versatile approach, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing T2V architectures. Extensive experiments on T2V-CompBench and VBench demonstrate that MagicComp outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential for applications such as complex prompt-based and trajectory-controllable video generation.

Current synthetic datasets primarily replicate real-world scenarios, leaving impossible, counterfactual and anti-reality video concepts underexplored. This work aims to answer two questions: 1) Can today's video generation models effectively follow prompts to create impossible video content? 2) Are today's video understanding models good enough for understanding impossible videos? To this end, we introduce IPV-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate and foster progress in video understanding and generation. IPV-Bench is underpinned by a comprehensive taxonomy, encompassing 4 domains, 14 categories. It features diverse scenes that defy physical, biological, geographical, or social laws. Based on the taxonomy, a prompt suite is constructed to evaluate video generation models, challenging their prompt following and creativity capabilities. In addition, a video benchmark is curated to assess Video-LLMs on their ability of understanding impossible videos, which particularly requires reasoning on temporal dynamics and world knowledge. Comprehensive evaluations reveal limitations and insights for future directions of video models, paving the way for next-generation video models.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Existing methods primarily employ LLM for high-level planning to decompose a story into scene-level descriptions, which are then independently generated and stitched together. However, these approaches struggle with generating high-quality videos aligned with the complex single-scene description, as visualizing such complex description involves coherent composition of multiple characters and events, complex motion synthesis and muti-character customization. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next, DreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame semantic control. We compare DreamRunner with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DreamRunner exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DreamRunner's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://zunwang1.github.io/DreamRunner</p></details> |

However, as LVDM training scales, the computational overhead of Video VAEs becomes a critical bottleneck, particularly for encoding high-resolution videos. To address this, we propose LeanVAE, a novel and ultra-efficient Video VAE framework that introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight architecture based on a Neighborhood-Aware Feedforward (NAF) module and non-overlapping patch operations, drastically reducing computational cost, and (2) the integration of wavelet transforms and compressed sensing techniques to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments validate LeanVAE's superiority in video reconstruction and generation, particularly in enhancing efficiency over existing Video VAEs. Our model offers up to 50x fewer FLOPs and 44x faster inference speed while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, providing insights for scalable, efficient video generation.

In this work, we propose UES (Unlocking Universal Editing via Self-Supervision), a lightweight self-supervised fine-tuning strategy that transforms generation models into unified generation-editing systems through self-supervised semantic alignment. Our approach establishes a dual-conditioning mechanism where original video-text pairs jointly provide visual and textual semantics, enabling structured learning of intrinsic spatiotemporal correspondences. Key advantages include: (i) Universality through supervision-free adaptation to diverse editing tasks, (ii) Unification of generation and editing applicable to most text(+image)-to-video model, and (iii) Efficiency via lightweight fine-tune that reduces tunable parameters by 92.67%. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce OmniBench-99, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 99 videos across humans/animals, environments, and objects, comprising 4 editing types and 8 scenarios. Extensive experiments show UES enables models without inherent editing capability to perform powerful and universal editing while preserving or even enhancing their original generation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://haroldchen19.github.io/UES-Page/</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Diagonal Decoding (DiagD), a training-free inference acceleration algorithm for autoregressively pre-trained models that exploits spatial and temporal correlations in videos. Our method generates tokens along diagonal paths in the spatial-temporal token grid, enabling parallel decoding within each frame as well as partially overlapping across consecutive frames. The proposed algorithm is versatile and adaptive to various generative models and tasks, while providing flexible control over the trade-off between inference speed and visual quality. Furthermore, we propose a cost-effective finetuning strategy that aligns the attention patterns of the model with our decoding order, further mitigating the training-inference gap on small-scale models. Experiments on multiple autoregressive video generation models and datasets demonstrate that DiagD achieves up to $10\times$ speedup compared to naive sequential decoding, while maintaining comparable visual fidelity.</p></details> |  |

Existing metrics lack a unified framework for systematically categorizing methodologies, limiting a holistic understanding of the evaluation landscape. Additionally, fragmented implementations and the absence of standardized interfaces lead to redundant processing overhead. Furthermore, many prior approaches are constrained by dataset-specific dependencies, limiting their applicability across diverse video domains. To address these challenges, we introduce AIGVE-Tool (AI-Generated Video Evaluation Toolkit), a unified framework that provides a structured and extensible evaluation pipeline for a comprehensive AI-generated video evaluation. Organized within a novel five-category taxonomy, AIGVE-Tool integrates multiple evaluation methodologies while allowing flexible customization through a modular configuration system. Additionally, we propose AIGVE-Bench, a large-scale benchmark dataset created with five SOTA video generation models based on hand-crafted instructions and prompts. This dataset systematically evaluates various video generation models across nine critical quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AIGVE-Tool in providing standardized and reliable evaluation results, highlighting specific strengths and limitations of current models and facilitating the advancements of next-generation AI-generated video techniques.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zero4dvid.github.io/</p></details> |

However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, a novel DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration without quality loss and high fidelity to original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish long-skip connections as critical architectural components for training stable and efficient diffusion transformers.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

Inspired by the Regularization by Denoising principle, we introduce an approach that integrates a Latent Diffusion Model, trained for the denoising task, into a variational framework using Half-Quadratic Splitting, exploiting its regularization properties. This approach, under appropriate conditions that can be easily met in various imaging applications, allows for reduced computational cost while achieving high-quality results. The proposed strategy, called Regularization by Latent Denoising (RELD), is then tested on a dataset of natural images, for image denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks. The numerical experiments show that RELD is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly achieving remarkable results when evaluated using perceptual quality metrics.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing methods that rely on bidirectional interaction between the diffusion model and control adapter, UniCon implements a unidirectional flow from the diffusion network to the adapter, allowing the adapter alone to generate the final output. UniCon reduces computational demands by eliminating the need for the diffusion model to compute and store gradients during adapter training. Our results indicate that UniCon reduces GPU memory usage by one-third and increases training speed by 2.3 times, while maintaining the same adapter parameter size. Additionally, without requiring extra computational resources, UniCon enables the training of adapters with double the parameter volume of existing ControlNets. In a series of image conditional generation tasks, UniCon has demonstrated precise responsiveness to control inputs and exceptional generation capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scenario Dreamer: Vectorized Latent Diffusion for Generating Driving Simulation Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22496v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Scenario Dreamer, a fully data-driven generative simulator for autonomous vehicle planning that generates both the initial traffic scene - comprising a lane graph and agent bounding boxes - and closed-loop agent behaviours. Existing methods for generating driving simulation environments encode the initial traffic scene as a rasterized image and, as such, require parameter-heavy networks that perform unnecessary computation due to many empty pixels in the rasterized scene. Moreover, we find that existing methods that employ rule-based agent behaviours lack diversity and realism. Scenario Dreamer instead employs a novel vectorized latent diffusion model for initial scene generation that directly operates on the vectorized scene elements and an autoregressive Transformer for data-driven agent behaviour simulation. Scenario Dreamer additionally supports scene extrapolation via diffusion inpainting, enabling the generation of unbounded simulation environments. Extensive experiments show that Scenario Dreamer outperforms existing generative simulators in realism and efficiency: the vectorized scene-generation base model achieves superior generation quality with around 2x fewer parameters, 6x lower generation latency, and 10x fewer GPU training hours compared to the strongest baseline. We confirm its practical utility by showing that reinforcement learning planning agents are more challenged in Scenario Dreamer environments than traditional non-generative simulation environments, especially on long and adversarial driving environments.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[GCRayDiffusion: Pose-Free Surface Reconstruction via Geometric Consistent Ray Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22349v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate surface reconstruction from unposed images is crucial for efficient 3D object or scene creation. However, it remains challenging, particularly for the joint camera pose estimation. Previous approaches have achieved impressive pose-free surface reconstruction results in dense-view settings, but could easily fail for sparse-view scenarios without sufficient visual overlap. In this paper, we propose a new technique for pose-free surface reconstruction, which follows triplane-based signed distance field (SDF) learning but regularizes the learning by explicit points sampled from ray-based diffusion of camera pose estimation. Our key contribution is a novel Geometric Consistent Ray Diffusion model (GCRayDiffusion), where we represent camera poses as neural bundle rays and regress the distribution of noisy rays via a diffusion model. More importantly, we further condition the denoising process of RGRayDiffusion using the triplane-based SDF of the entire scene, which provides effective 3D consistent regularization to achieve multi-view consistent camera pose estimation. Finally, we incorporate RGRayDiffusion into the triplane-based SDF learning by introducing on-surface geometric regularization from the sampling points of the neural bundle rays, which leads to highly accurate pose-free surface reconstruction results even for sparse-view inputs. Extensive evaluations on public datasets show that our GCRayDiffusion achieves more accurate camera pose estimation than previous approaches, with geometrically more consistent surface reconstruction results, especially given sparse-view inputs.</p></details> |  |

Although commercial companies have increasingly committed to using watermarks, the robustness of existing watermarking schemes against forgery attacks is understudied. This paper proposes DiffForge, the first watermark forgery framework capable of forging imperceptible watermarks under a no-box setting. We estimate the watermark distribution using an unconditional diffusion model and introduce shallow inversion to inject the watermark into a non-watermarked image seamlessly. This approach facilitates watermark injection while preserving image quality by adaptively selecting the depth of inversion steps, leveraging our key insight that watermarks degrade with added noise during the early diffusion phases. Comprehensive evaluations show that DiffForge deceives open-source watermark detectors with a 96.38% success rate and misleads a commercial watermark system with over 97% success rate, achieving high confidence.1 This work reveals fundamental security limitations in current watermarking paradigms.</p></details> |  |

We model the unknown distribution of volumetric fields using an unconditional diffusion model trained on a novel benchmark dataset comprising 1,000 synthetically simulated volumetric density fields. The neural diffusion model is trained on the latent codes of a novel, diffusion-friendly, monoplanar representation. The generative model is used to incorporate a tailored parametric diffusion posterior sampling technique into different reconstruction tasks. A physically-based differentiable volume renderer is employed to provide gradients with respect to light transport in the latent space. This stands in contrast to classic NeRF approaches and makes the reconstructions better aligned with observed data. Through various experiments, we demonstrate single-view reconstruction of volumetric clouds at a previously unattainable quality.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Therefore, it is essential to verify the integrity of T2I diffusion models. To this end, considering the randomness within the outputs of generative models and the high costs in interacting with them, we discern model tampering via the KL divergence between the distributions of the features of generated images. We propose a novel prompt selection algorithm based on learning automaton (PromptLA) for efficient and accurate verification. Evaluations on four advanced T2I models (e.g., SDXL, FLUX.1) demonstrate that our method achieves a mean AUC of over 0.96 in integrity detection, exceeding baselines by more than 0.2, showcasing strong effectiveness and generalization. Additionally, our approach achieves lower cost and is robust against image-level post-processing. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work addressing the integrity verification of T2I diffusion models, which establishes quantifiable standards for AI copyright litigation in practice.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Diffusion models, known for their superior generative capabilities, have recently shown promise in advancing face-swapping quality. This paper addresses two key challenges in diffusion-based face swapping: the prioritized preservation of identity over target attributes and the inherent conflict between identity and attribute conditioning. To tackle these issues, we introduce an identity-constrained attribute-tuning framework for face swapping that first ensures identity preservation and then fine-tunes for attribute alignment, achieved through a decoupled condition injection. We further enhance fidelity by incorporating identity and adversarial losses in a post-training refinement stage. Our proposed identity-constrained diffusion-based face-swapping model outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating superior identity similarity and attribute consistency, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity face swapping.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces \textit{MegaTTS 3}, a TTS system featuring an innovative sparse alignment algorithm that guides the latent diffusion transformer (DiT). Specifically, we provide sparse alignment boundaries to MegaTTS 3 to reduce the difficulty of alignment without limiting the search space, thereby achieving high naturalness. Moreover, we employ a multi-condition classifier-free guidance strategy for accent intensity adjustment and adopt the piecewise rectified flow technique to accelerate the generation process. Experiments demonstrate that MegaTTS 3 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS speech quality and supports highly flexible control over accent intensity. Notably, our system can generate high-quality one-minute speech with only 8 sampling steps. Audio samples are available at https://sditdemo.github.io/sditdemo/.</p></details> |  |

Existing watermarking methods, while effective for image diffusion models, do not account for temporal consistency, leading to degraded video quality and reduced robustness against video distortions. To address this issue, we introduce LVMark, a novel watermarking method for video diffusion models. We propose a new watermark decoder tailored for generated videos by learning the consistency between adjacent frames. It ensures accurate message decoding, even under malicious attacks, by combining the low-frequency components of the 3D wavelet domain with the RGB features of the video. Additionally, our approach minimizes video quality degradation by embedding watermark messages in layers with minimal impact on visual appearance using an importance-based weight modulation strategy. We optimize both the watermark decoder and the latent decoder of diffusion model, effectively balancing the trade-off between visual quality and bit accuracy. Our experiments show that our method embeds invisible watermarks into video diffusion models, ensuring robust decoding accuracy with 512-bit capacity, even under video distortions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we focus on the problem of generating music synchronized with rhythmic visual cues of the given dance video. Considering that bi-directional guidance is more beneficial for training a diffusion model, we propose to enhance the quality of generated music and its synchronization with dance videos by adopting both positive rhythmic information and negative ones (PN-Diffusion) as conditions, where a dual diffusion and reverse processes is devised. Specifically, to train a sequential multi-modal U-Net structure, PN-Diffusion consists of a noise prediction objective for positive conditioning and an additional noise prediction objective for negative conditioning. To accurately define and select both positive and negative conditioning, we ingeniously utilize temporal correlations in dance videos, capturing positive and negative rhythmic cues by playing them forward and backward, respectively. Through subjective and objective evaluations of input-output correspondence in terms of dance-music beat alignment and the quality of generated music, experimental results on the AIST++ and TikTok dance video datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms SOTA dance-to-music generation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics-Guided Diffusion Model for Sensor-less Robot Manipulator Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15038v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Dynamics-Guided Diffusion Model (DGDM), a data-driven framework for generating task-specific manipulator designs without task-specific training. Given object shapes and task specifications, DGDM generates sensor-less manipulator designs that can blindly manipulate objects towards desired motions and poses using an open-loop parallel motion. This framework 1) flexibly represents manipulation tasks as interaction profiles, 2) represents the design space using a geometric diffusion model, and 3) efficiently searches this design space using the gradients provided by a dynamics network trained without any task information. We evaluate DGDM on various manipulation tasks ranging from shifting/rotating objects to converging objects to a specific pose. Our generated designs outperform optimization-based and unguided diffusion baselines relatively by 31.5% and 45.3% on average success rate. With the ability to generate a new design within 0.8s, DGDM facilitates rapid design iteration and enhances the adoption of data-driven approaches for robot mechanism design. Qualitative results are best viewed on our project website https://dgdm-robot.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

However, existing generative models struggle to maintain object-level accuracy when translating images between domains, especially when domain gaps are significant. In this work, we introduce AGILE (Attention-Guided Image and Label Translation for Efficient Cross-Domain Plant Trait Identification), a diffusion-based framework that leverages optimized text embeddings and attention guidance to semantically constrain image translation. AGILE utilizes pretrained diffusion models and publicly available agricultural datasets to improve the fidelity of translated images while preserving critical object semantics. Our approach optimizes text embeddings to strengthen the correspondence between source and target images and guides attention maps during the denoising process to control object placement. We evaluate AGILE on cross-domain plant datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in generating semantically accurate translated images. Quantitative experiments show that AGILE enhances object detection performance in the target domain while maintaining realism and consistency. Compared to prior image translation methods, AGILE achieves superior semantic alignment, particularly in challenging cases where objects vary significantly or domain gaps are substantial.</p></details> |  |

Existing editing approaches, as post-processing, struggle to offer effective manipulation across diverse styles. Additionally, these methods either rely on expensive real-world light-stage data collection or require extensive computational resources for training. To address these limitations, we introduce Shadow Director, a method that extracts and manipulates hidden shadow attributes within well-trained diffusion models. Our approach uses a small estimation network that requires only a few thousand synthetic images and hours of training-no costly real-world light-stage data needed. Shadow Director enables parametric and intuitive control over shadow shape, placement, and intensity during portrait generation while preserving artistic integrity and identity across diverse styles. Despite training only on synthetic data built on real-world identities, it generalizes effectively to generated portraits with diverse styles, making it a more accessible and resource-friendly solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Shado...</summary><p>ShadowDirector Arxiv Version</p></details> |
| **[Accelerate High-Quality Diffusion Models with Inner Loop Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13107v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Inner Loop Feedback (ILF), a novel approach to accelerate diffusion models' inference. ILF trains a lightweight module to predict future features in the denoising process by leveraging the outputs from a chosen diffusion backbone block at a given time step. This approach exploits two key intuitions; (1) the outputs of a given block at adjacent time steps are similar, and (2) performing partial computations for a step imposes a lower burden on the model than skipping the step entirely. Our method is highly flexible, since we find that the feedback module itself can simply be a block from the diffusion backbone, with all settings copied. Its influence on the diffusion forward can be tempered with a learnable scaling factor from zero initialization. We train this module using distillation losses; however, unlike some prior work where a full diffusion backbone serves as the student, our model freezes the backbone, training only the feedback module. While many efforts to optimize diffusion models focus on achieving acceptable image quality in extremely few steps (1-4 steps), our emphasis is on matching best case results (typically achieved in 20 steps) while significantly reducing runtime. ILF achieves this balance effectively, demonstrating strong performance for both class-to-image generation with diffusion transformer (DiT) and text-to-image generation with DiT-based PixArt-alpha and PixArt-sigma. The quality of ILF's 1.7x-1.8x speedups are confirmed by FID, CLIP score, CLIP Image Quality Assessment, ImageReward, and qualitative comparisons.

Such methods fail once the LR images are generated differently. Current blind-SR methods aim to remove this assumption, but are still fundamentally restricted to rather simplistic downscaling SR-kernels (e.g., anisotropic Gaussian kernels), and fail on more complex (out of distribution) downscaling degradations. However, using the correct SR-kernel is often more important than using a sophisticated SR algorithm. In ``KernelFusion'' we introduce a zero-shot diffusion-based method that makes no assumptions about the kernel. Our method recovers the unique image-specific SR-kernel directly from the LR input image, while simultaneously recovering its corresponding HR image. KernelFusion exploits the principle that the correct SR-kernel is the one that maximizes patch similarity across different scales of the LR image. We first train an image-specific patch-based diffusion model on the single LR input image, capturing its unique internal patch statistics. We then reconstruct a larger HR image with the same learned patch distribution, while simultaneously recovering the correct downscaling SR-kernel that maintains this cross-scale relation between the HR and LR images. Empirical results show that KernelFusion vastly outperforms all SR baselines on complex downscaling degradations, where existing SotA Blind-SR methods fail miserably. By breaking free from predefined kernel assumptions, KernelFusion pushes Blind-SR into a new assumption-free paradigm, handling downscaling kernels previously thought impossible.</p></details> |  |

While existing works focus on optimizing denoising directions, we address the principled design of stepsize schedules. This paper proposes Optimal Stepsize Distillation, a dynamic programming framework that extracts theoretically optimal schedules by distilling knowledge from reference trajectories. By reformulating stepsize optimization as recursive error minimization, our method guarantees global discretization bounds through optimal substructure exploitation. Crucially, the distilled schedules demonstrate strong robustness across architectures, ODE solvers, and noise schedules. Experiments show 10x accelerated text-to-image generation while preserving 99.4% performance on GenEval. Our code is available at https://github.com/bebebe666/OptimalSteps.</p></details> |  |

While centrality measures such as degree, closeness, and betweenness have been commonly used to assess nodal importance, they provide limited insight into dynamic network behaviors. By incorporating eigenvalue analysis, which evaluates network robustness and connectivity through spectral properties, and diffusion processes that model information flow, this framework offers a deeper understanding of how networks function under dynamic conditions. Applied to synthetic networks, the approach identifies key nodes not only by centrality but also by their role in diffusion dynamics and vulnerability points, offering a multi-dimensional view that traditional methods alone cannot. This integrated analysis enables a more precise identification of critical nodes and potential weaknesses, with implications for improving network resilience in fields ranging from epidemiology to cybersecurity.

| **[Progressive Rendering Distillation: Adapting Stable Diffusion for Instant Text-to-Mesh Generation without 3D Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21694v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is highly desirable to obtain a model that can generate high-quality 3D meshes from text prompts in just seconds. While recent attempts have adapted pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into generators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor quality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at overcoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D ground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a native 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to progressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each step it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion models, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill text-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score distillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can easily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for challenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate the inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we train a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only $2.5\%$ trainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo outperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality. Specifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and generalize well for challenging text input.

This paper proposes frequency-controlled diffusion model (FCDiffusion), an end-to-end diffusion-based framework that contributes a novel solution to text-guided I2I from a frequency-domain perspective. At the heart of our framework is a feature-space frequency-domain filtering module based on Discrete Cosine Transform, which filters the latent features of the source image in the DCT domain, yielding filtered image features bearing different DCT spectral bands as different control signals to the pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model. We reveal that control signals of different DCT spectral bands bridge the source image and the T2I generated image in different correlations (e.g., style, structure, layout, contour, etc.), and thus enable versatile I2I applications emphasizing different I2I correlations, including style-guided content creation, image semantic manipulation, image scene translation, and image style translation. Different from related approaches, FCDiffusion establishes a unified text-guided I2I framework suitable for diverse image translation tasks simply by switching among different frequency control branches at inference time. The effectiveness and superiority of our method for text-guided I2I are demonstrated with extensive experiments both qualitatively and quantitatively.

| **[Layer- and Timestep-Adaptive Differentiable Token Compression Ratios for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16822v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) image generation quality but suffer from high latency and memory inefficiency, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices. One major efficiency bottleneck is that existing DiTs apply equal computation across all regions of an image. However, not all image tokens are equally important, and certain localized areas require more computation, such as objects. To address this, we propose DiffCR, a dynamic DiT inference framework with differentiable compression ratios, which automatically learns to dynamically route computation across layers and timesteps for each image token, resulting in efficient DiTs. Specifically, DiffCR integrates three features: (1) A token-level routing scheme where each DiT layer includes a router that is fine-tuned jointly with model weights to predict token importance scores. In this way, unimportant tokens bypass the entire layer's computation; (2) A layer-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where different DiT layers automatically learn varying compression ratios from a zero initialization, resulting in large compression ratios in redundant layers while others remain less compressed or even uncompressed; (3) A timestep-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where each denoising timestep learns its own compression ratio. The resulting pattern shows higher ratios for noisier timesteps and lower ratios as the image becomes clearer. Extensive experiments on text-to-image and inpainting tasks show that DiffCR effectively captures dynamism across token, layer, and timestep axes, achieving superior trade-offs between generation quality and efficiency compared to prior works.

| **[AlignDiff: Learning Physically-Grounded Camera Alignment via Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21581v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate camera calibration is a fundamental task for 3D perception, especially when dealing with real-world, in-the-wild environments where complex optical distortions are common. Existing methods often rely on pre-rectified images or calibration patterns, which limits their applicability and flexibility. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that addresses these challenges by jointly modeling camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters using a generic ray camera model. Unlike previous approaches, AlignDiff shifts focus from semantic to geometric features, enabling more accurate modeling of local distortions. We propose AlignDiff, a diffusion model conditioned on geometric priors, enabling the simultaneous estimation of camera distortions and scene geometry. To enhance distortion prediction, we incorporate edge-aware attention, focusing the model on geometric features around image edges, rather than semantic content. Furthermore, to enhance generalizability to real-world captures, we incorporate a large database of ray-traced lenses containing over three thousand samples. This database characterizes the distortion inherent in a diverse variety of lens forms. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the angular error of estimated ray bundles by ~8.2 degrees and overall calibration accuracy, outperforming existing approaches on challenging, real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[TREAD: Token Routing for Efficient Architecture-agnostic Diffusion Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04765v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as the mainstream approach for visual generation. However, these models typically suffer from sample inefficiency and high training costs. Consequently, methods for efficient finetuning, inference and personalization were quickly adopted by the community. However, training these models in the first place remains very costly. While several recent approaches - including masking, distillation, and architectural modifications - have been proposed to improve training efficiency, each of these methods comes with a tradeoff: they achieve enhanced performance at the expense of increased computational cost or vice versa. In contrast, this work aims to improve training efficiency as well as generative performance at the same time through routes that act as a transport mechanism for randomly selected tokens from early layers to deeper layers of the model. Our method is not limited to the common transformer-based model - it can also be applied to state-space models and achieves this without architectural modifications or additional parameters. Finally, we show that TREAD reduces computational cost and simultaneously boosts model performance on the standard ImageNet-256 benchmark in class-conditional synthesis. Both of these benefits multiply to a convergence speedup of 14x at 400K training iterations compared to DiT and 37x compared to the best benchmark performance of DiT at 7M training iterations. Furthermore, we achieve a competitive FID of 2.09 in a guided and 3.93 in an unguided setting, which improves upon the DiT, without architectural changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[SyncSDE: A Probabilistic Framework for Diffusion Synchronization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21555v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There have been many attempts to leverage multiple diffusion models for collaborative generation, extending beyond the original domain. A prominent approach involves synchronizing multiple diffusion trajectories by mixing the estimated scores to artificially correlate the generation processes. However, existing methods rely on naive heuristics, such as averaging, without considering task specificity. These approaches do not clarify why such methods work and often fail when a heuristic suitable for one task is blindly applied to others. In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework for analyzing why diffusion synchronization works and reveal where heuristics should be focused - modeling correlations between multiple trajectories and adapting them to each specific task. We further identify optimal correlation models per task, achieving better results than previous approaches that apply a single heuristic across all tasks without justification.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[Training-free Diffusion Acceleration with Bottleneck Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18940v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual content generation but remain challenging to deploy due to their high computational cost during inference. This computational burden primarily arises from the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video resolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality or necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are pre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these low-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading performance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free framework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead while preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high denoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and final stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To mitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution transition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage. We evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where extensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to 3$\times$ for image generation and 2.5$\times$ for video generation, all while maintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling process across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tyfeld.github.io/BottleneckSampling.github.io/</p></details> |

However, most existing models primarily utilize protein sequence or structural data for training, neglecting the physicochemical properties of proteins.Moreover, they are deficient to control the generation of proteins in intuitive conditions. To address these limitations,we propose CMADiff here, a novel framework that enables controllable protein generation by aligning the physicochemical properties of protein sequences with text-based descriptions through a latent diffusion process. Specifically, CMADiff employs a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to integrate physicochemical features as conditional input, forming a robust latent space that captures biological traits. In this latent space, we apply a conditional diffusion process, which is guided by BioAligner, a contrastive learning-based module that aligns text descriptions with protein features, enabling text-driven control over protein sequence generation. Validated by a series of evaluations including AlphaFold3, the experimental results indicate that CMADiff outperforms protein sequence generation benchmarks and holds strong potential for future applications.

We consider a simple extension of the Standard Model with the type I seesaw mechanism and train a neural network to generate the neutrino mass matrix. By utilizing transfer learning, the diffusion model generates 104 solutions that are consistent with the neutrino mass squared differences and the leptonic mixing angles. The distributions of the CP phases and the sums of neutrino masses, which are not included in the conditional labels but are calculated from the solutions, exhibit non-trivial tendencies. In addition, the effective mass in neutrinoless double beta decay is concentrated near the boundaries of the existing confidence intervals, allowing us to verify the obtained solutions through future experiments. An inverse approach using the diffusion model is expected to facilitate the experimental verification of flavor models from a perspective distinct from conventional analytical methods.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Diffusion Image Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21410v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot image restoration (IR) methods based on pretrained diffusion models have recently achieved significant success. These methods typically require at least a parametric form of the degradation model. However, in real-world scenarios, the degradation may be too complex to define explicitly. To handle this general case, we introduce the Diffusion Image Prior (DIIP). We take inspiration from the Deep Image Prior (DIP)[16], since it can be used to remove artifacts without the need for an explicit degradation model. However, in contrast to DIP, we find that pretrained diffusion models offer a much stronger prior, despite being trained without knowledge from corrupted data. We show that, the optimization process in DIIP first reconstructs a clean version of the image before eventually overfitting to the degraded input, but it does so for a broader range of degradations than DIP. In light of this result, we propose a blind image restoration (IR) method based on early stopping, which does not require prior knowledge of the degradation model. We validate DIIP on various degradation-blind IR tasks, including JPEG artifact removal, waterdrop removal, denoising and super-resolution with state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Video Tokenization: A Conditioned Diffusion-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03708v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video tokenizers typically use the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture for video compression and reconstruction. However, to achieve good performance, its training process often relies on complex multi-stage training tricks that go beyond basic reconstruction loss and KL regularization. Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise tuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate higher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel Conditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based decoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses spatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder reconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these latents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate videos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt sampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a basic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS perceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a single-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\times$ inference speedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent video generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The source code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/ali-vilab/CDT.</p></details> |  |

We derive explicit expressions for the moment- and cumulant-generating functionals, in terms of the distribution of the initial data and properties of forward process. It is shown analytically that during the forward process higher-order cumulants are conserved in models without a drift, such as the variance-expanding scheme, and that therefore the endpoint of the forward process maintains nontrivial correlations. We demonstrate that since these correlations are encoded in the score function, higher-order cumulants are learnt in the backward process, also when starting from a normal prior. We confirm our analytical results in an exactly solvable toy model with nonzero cumulants and in scalar lattice field theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, many figures.

In this paper, we propose a novel, problem-agnostic diffusion model called the maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based guided term estimation method for inverse problems. To leverage unconditionally pretrained diffusion models to address conditional generation tasks, we divide the conditional score function into two terms according to Bayes' rule: an unconditional score function (approximated by a pretrained score network) and a guided term, which is estimated using a novel MAP-based method that incorporates a Gaussian-type prior of natural images. This innovation allows us to better capture the intrinsic properties of the data, leading to improved performance. Numerical results demonstrate that our method preserves contents more effectively compared to state-of-the-art methods--for example, maintaining the structure of glasses in super-resolution tasks and producing more coherent results in the neighborhood of masked regions during inpainting.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

Existing de-biasing techniques rely heavily on additional training, which imposes high computational costs and risks of compromising core image generation functionality. This hinders them from being widely adopted to real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Stable Diffusion's overlooked potential to reduce bias without requiring additional training. Through our analysis, we uncover that initial noises associated with minority attributes form "minority regions" rather than scattered. We view these "minority regions" as opportunities in SD to reduce bias. To unlock the potential, we propose a novel de-biasing method called 'weak guidance,' carefully designed to guide a random noise to the minority regions without compromising semantic integrity. Through analysis and experiments on various versions of SD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively reduces bias without additional training, achieving both efficiency and preservation of core image generation functionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages; First two authors contributed equally; Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a vital yet complex open-set task in computer vision, commonly tackled through reconstruction-based methods. However, these methods struggle with two key limitations: (1) insufficient robustness in open-set scenarios, where unseen normal motions are frequently misclassified as anomalies, and (2) an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, local motion reconstruction, which are inherently difficult to capture accurately due to their diversity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training. First, we enhance robustness by training a generator to produce perturbed samples, which are similar to normal samples and target the weakness of the reconstruction model. This training paradigm expands the reconstruction domain of the model, improving its generalization to unseen normal motions. Second, to address the overemphasis on motion details, we employ the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to separate high-frequency (local) and low-frequency (global) motion components. By guiding the diffusion model with observed high-frequency information, we prioritize the reconstruction of low-frequency components, enabling more accurate and robust anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on five widely used VAD datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness in open-set scenarios and diverse motion contexts.

| **[MotionDiff: Training-free Zero-shot Interactive Motion Editing via Flow-assisted Multi-view Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17695v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have made remarkable advancements and are capable of producing high-quality content. However, performing controllable editing with generative models remains challenging, due to their inherent uncertainty in outputs. This challenge is praticularly pronounced in motion editing, which involves the processing of spatial information. While some physics-based generative methods have attempted to implement motion editing, they typically operate on single-view images with simple motions, such as translation and dragging. These methods struggle to handle complex rotation and stretching motions and ensure multi-view consistency, often necessitating resource-intensive retraining. To address these challenges, we propose MotionDiff, a training-free zero-shot diffusion method that leverages optical flow for complex multi-view motion editing. Specifically, given a static scene, users can interactively select objects of interest to add motion priors. The proposed Point Kinematic Model (PKM) then estimates corresponding multi-view optical flows during the Multi-view Flow Estimation Stage (MFES). Subsequently, these optical flows are utilized to generate multi-view motion results through decoupled motion representation in the Multi-view Motion Diffusion Stage (MMDS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionDiff outperforms other physics-based generative motion editing methods in achieving high-quality multi-view consistent motion results. Notably, MotionDiff does not require retraining, enabling users to conveniently adapt it for various down-stream tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods primarily focus on real-time generation of head movements, but struggle to produce synchronized body motions that match these head actions. Additionally, achieving fine-grained control over the speaking style and nuances of facial expressions remains a challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework for stylized real-time portrait video generation, enabling expressive and flexible video chat that extends from talking head to upper-body interaction. Our approach consists of the following two stages. The first stage involves efficient hierarchical motion diffusion models, that take both explicit and implicit motion representations into account based on audio inputs, which can generate a diverse range of facial expressions with stylistic control and synchronization between head and body movements. The second stage aims to generate portrait video featuring upper-body movements, including hand gestures. We inject explicit hand control signals into the generator to produce more detailed hand movements, and further perform face refinement to enhance the overall realism and expressiveness of the portrait video. Additionally, our approach supports efficient and continuous generation of upper-body portrait video in maximum 512 * 768 resolution at up to 30fps on 4090 GPU, supporting interactive video-chat in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of our approach to produce portrait videos with rich expressiveness and natural upper-body movements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://humanaigc.github.io/chat-anyone/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Better Alignment: Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning Against Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11240v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation. However, their practical applications are hindered by the misalignment between generated images and corresponding text prompts. To tackle this issue, reinforcement learning (RL) has been considered for diffusion model fine-tuning. Yet, RL's effectiveness is limited by the challenge of sparse reward, where feedback is only available at the end of the generation process. This makes it difficult to identify which actions during the denoising process contribute positively to the final generated image, potentially leading to ineffective or unnecessary denoising policies. To this end, this paper presents a novel RL-based framework that addresses the sparse reward problem when training diffusion models. Our framework, named $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$, employs two strategies: \textbf{B}ackward progressive training and \textbf{B}ranch-based sampling. For one thing, backward progressive training focuses initially on the final timesteps of denoising process and gradually extends the training interval to earlier timesteps, easing the learning difficulty from sparse rewards. For another, we perform branch-based sampling for each training interval. By comparing the samples within the same branch, we can identify how much the policies of the current training interval contribute to the final image, which helps to learn effective policies instead of unnecessary ones. $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ is compatible with existing optimization algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ in improving prompt-image alignment and maintaining diversity in generated images. The code for this work is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025, add references</p></details> |

Unlike the commonly studied scenarios involving a single human or hand interacting with one object, we address a more generic multi-body setting with arbitrary numbers of humans, hands, and objects. This complexity introduces significant challenges in synchronizing motions due to the high correlations and mutual influences among bodies. To address these challenges, we introduce SyncDiff, a novel method for multi-body interaction synthesis using a synchronized motion diffusion strategy. SyncDiff employs a single diffusion model to capture the joint distribution of multi-body motions. To enhance motion fidelity, we propose a frequency-domain motion decomposition scheme. Additionally, we introduce a new set of alignment scores to emphasize the synchronization of different body motions. SyncDiff jointly optimizes both data sample likelihood and alignment likelihood through an explicit synchronization strategy. Extensive experiments across four datasets with various multi-body configurations demonstrate the superiority of SyncDiff over existing state-of-the-art motion synthesis methods.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Can Video Diffusion Model Reconstruct 4D Geometry?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21082v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes (i.e., 4D geometry) from monocular video is an important yet challenging problem. Conventional multiview geometry-based approaches often struggle with dynamic motion, whereas recent learning-based methods either require specialized 4D representation or sophisticated optimization. In this paper, we present Sora3R, a novel framework that taps into the rich spatiotemporal priors of large-scale video diffusion models to directly infer 4D pointmaps from casual videos. Sora3R follows a two-stage pipeline: (1) we adapt a pointmap VAE from a pretrained video VAE, ensuring compatibility between the geometry and video latent spaces; (2) we finetune a diffusion backbone in combined video and pointmap latent space to generate coherent 4D pointmaps for every frame. Sora3R operates in a fully feedforward manner, requiring no external modules (e.g., depth, optical flow, or segmentation) or iterative global alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sora3R reliably recovers both camera poses and detailed scene geometry, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art methods for dynamic 4D reconstruction across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theory on Score-Mismatched Diffusion Models and Zero-Shot Conditional Samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13746v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The denoising diffusion model has recently emerged as a powerful generative technique, capable of transforming noise into meaningful data. While theoretical convergence guarantees for diffusion models are well established when the target distribution aligns with the training distribution, practical scenarios often present mismatches. One common case is in the zero-shot conditional diffusion sampling, where the target conditional distribution is different from the (unconditional) training distribution. These score-mismatched diffusion models remain largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we present the first performance guarantee with explicit dimensional dependencies for general score-mismatched diffusion samplers, focusing on target distributions with finite second moments. We show that score mismatches result in an asymptotic distributional bias between the target and sampling distributions, proportional to the accumulated mismatch between the target and training distributions. This result can be directly applied to zero-shot conditional samplers for any conditional model, irrespective of measurement noise. Interestingly, the derived convergence upper bound offers useful guidance for designing a novel bias-optimal zero-shot sampler in linear conditional models that minimizes the asymptotic bias. For such bias-optimal samplers, we further establish convergence guarantees with explicit dependencies on dimension and conditioning, applied to several interesting target distributions, including those with bounded support and Gaussian mixtures. Our findings are supported by numerical studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Broadening Target Distributions for Accelerated Diffusion Models via a Novel Analysis Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13901v4)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerated diffusion models hold the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency of standard diffusion processes. Theoretically, these models have been shown to achieve faster convergence rates than the standard $\mathcal O(1/\epsilon^2)$ rate of vanilla diffusion models, where $\epsilon$ denotes the target accuracy. However, current theoretical studies have established the acceleration advantage only for restrictive target distribution classes, such as those with smoothness conditions imposed along the entire sampling path or with bounded support. In this work, we significantly broaden the target distribution classes with a new accelerated stochastic DDPM sampler. In particular, we show that it achieves accelerated performance for three broad distribution classes not considered before. Our first class relies on the smoothness condition posed only to the target density $q_0$, which is far more relaxed than the existing smoothness conditions posed to all $q_t$ along the entire sampling path. Our second class requires only a finite second moment condition, allowing for a much wider class of target distributions than the existing finite-support condition. Our third class is Gaussian mixture, for which our result establishes the first acceleration guarantee. Moreover, among accelerated DDPM type samplers, our results specialized for bounded-support distributions show an improved dependency on the data dimension $d$. Our analysis introduces a novel technique for establishing performance guarantees via constructing a tilting factor representation of the convergence error and utilizing Tweedie's formula to handle Taylor expansion terms. This new analytical framework may be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Multimodal Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20853v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal generative models that can understand and generate across multiple modalities are dominated by autoregressive (AR) approaches, which process tokens sequentially from left to right, or top to bottom. These models jointly handle images, text, video, and audio for various tasks such as image captioning, question answering, and image generation. In this work, we explore discrete diffusion models as a unified generative formulation in the joint text and image domain, building upon their recent success in text generation. Discrete diffusion models offer several advantages over AR models, including improved control over quality versus diversity of generated samples, the ability to perform joint multimodal inpainting (across both text and image domains), and greater controllability in generation through guidance. Leveraging these benefits, we present the first Unified Multimodal Discrete Diffusion (UniDisc) model which is capable of jointly understanding and generating text and images for a variety of downstream tasks. We compare UniDisc to multimodal AR models, performing a scaling analysis and demonstrating that UniDisc outperforms them in terms of both performance and inference-time compute, enhanced controllability, editability, inpainting, and flexible trade-off between inference time and generation quality.

| **[High Quality Diffusion Distillation on a Single GPU with Relative and Absolute Position Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20744v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce relative and absolute position matching (RAPM), a diffusion distillation method resulting in high quality generation that can be trained efficiently on a single GPU. Recent diffusion distillation research has achieved excellent results for high-resolution text-to-image generation with methods such as phased consistency models (PCM) and improved distribution matching distillation (DMD2). However, these methods generally require many GPUs (e.g.~8-64) and significant batchsizes (e.g.~128-2048) during training, resulting in memory and compute requirements that are beyond the resources of some researchers. RAPM provides effective single-GPU diffusion distillation training with a batchsize of 1. The new method attempts to mimic the sampling trajectories of the teacher model by matching the relative and absolute positions. The design of relative positions is inspired by PCM. Two discriminators are introduced accordingly in RAPM, one for matching relative positions and the other for absolute positions. Experimental results on StableDiffusion (SD) V1.5 and SDXL indicate that RAPM with 4 timesteps produces comparable FID scores as the best method with 1 timestep under very limited computational resources.</p></details> |  |

However, manual disease delineation for ADC and TDV measurements is unfeasible in clinical practice, demanding automation. As a first step, we propose an algorithm to generate fast and reproducible probability maps of the skeleton, adjacent internal organs (liver, spleen, urinary bladder, and kidneys), and spinal canal. Methods: We developed an automated deep-learning pipeline based on a 3D patch-based Residual U-Net architecture that localizes and delineates these anatomical structures on WB-DWI. The algorithm was trained using "soft-labels" (non-binary segmentations) derived from a computationally intensive atlas-based approach. For training and validation, we employed a multi-center WB-DWI dataset comprising 532 scans from patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer (APC) or Multiple Myeloma (MM), with testing on 45 patients. Results: Our weakly-supervised deep learning model achieved an average dice score/precision/recall of 0.66/0.6/0.73 for skeletal delineations, 0.8/0.79/0.81 for internal organs, and 0.85/0.79/0.94 for spinal canal, with surface distances consistently below 3 mm. Relative median ADC and log-transformed volume differences between automated and manual expert-defined full-body delineations were below 10% and 4%, respectively. The computational time for generating probability maps was 12x faster than the atlas-based registration algorithm (25 s vs. 5 min). An experienced radiologist rated the model's accuracy "good" or "excellent" on test datasets. Conclusion: Our model offers fast and reproducible probability maps for localizing and delineating body regions on WB-DWI, enabling ADC and TDV quantification, potentially supporting clinicians in disease staging and treatment response assessment.</p></details> |  |

While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for simple manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g., the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when handling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce DexHandDiff, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive dexterous manipulation. DexHandDiff models joint state-action dynamics through a dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact alignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive generalizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics model-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated guidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical interactions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues. Experiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block re-orientation, object relocation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexHandDiff's effectiveness on goals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves an average of 70.7% success rate on goal adaptive dexterous tasks, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

While in this paper, we investigate the capability of GenAI for text-to-model generation, to see whether GenAI can comprehend hyper-level knowledge embedded within AI itself parameters. Specifically, we study a practical scenario termed train-once-for-all personalization, aiming to generate personalized models for diverse end-users and tasks using text prompts. Inspired by the recent emergence of neural network diffusion, we present Tina, a text-conditioned neural network diffusion for train-once-for-all personalization. Tina leverages a diffusion transformer model conditioned on task descriptions embedded using a CLIP model. Despite the astronomical number of potential personalized tasks (e.g., $1.73\times10^{13}$), by our design, Tina demonstrates remarkable in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization even trained on small datasets ($\sim 1000$). We further verify whether and how \Tina understands world knowledge by analyzing its capabilities under zero-shot/few-shot image prompts, different numbers of personalized classes, prompts of natural language descriptions, and predicting unseen entities.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, data scarcity caused by atmospheric conditions, seasonal variations, and limited geographical coverage hinders the effective application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in EO. Traditional data augmentation techniques, which rely on basic parameterized image transformations, often fail to introduce sufficient diversity across key semantic axes. These axes include natural changes such as snow and floods, human impacts like urbanization and roads, and disasters such as wildfires and storms, which limits the accuracy of AI models in EO applications. To address this, we propose a four-stage data augmentation approach that integrates diffusion models to enhance semantic diversity. Our method employs meta-prompts for instruction generation, vision-language models for rich captioning, EO-specific diffusion model fine-tuning, and iterative data augmentation. Extensive experiments using four augmentation techniques demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms established methods, generating semantically diverse EO images and improving AI model performance.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures |

Semantic watermarks, such as Tree-Rings and Gaussian Shading, represent a novel class of watermarking techniques that are easy to implement and highly robust against various perturbations. However, our work demonstrates a fundamental security vulnerability of semantic watermarks. We show that attackers can leverage unrelated models, even with different latent spaces and architectures (UNet vs DiT), to perform powerful and realistic forgery attacks. Specifically, we design two watermark forgery attacks. The first imprints a targeted watermark into real images by manipulating the latent representation of an arbitrary image in an unrelated LDM to get closer to the latent representation of a watermarked image. We also show that this technique can be used for watermark removal. The second attack generates new images with the target watermark by inverting a watermarked image and re-generating it with an arbitrary prompt. Both attacks just need a single reference image with the target watermark. Overall, our findings question the applicability of semantic watermarks by revealing that attackers can easily forge or remove these watermarks under realistic conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 22 figures, 8 tables, to be published in The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 (CVPR)</p></details> |

While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation.

They are handy for tasks in the image domain, where the quality of the explanations benefits from recent advances in generative models. Although counterfactual explanations have been widely applied to classification models, their application to regression tasks remains underexplored. We present two methods to create counterfactual explanations for image regression tasks using diffusion-based generative models to address challenges in sparsity and quality: 1) one based on a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model that operates directly in pixel-space and 2) another based on a Diffusion Autoencoder operating in latent space. Both produce realistic, semantic, and smooth counterfactuals on CelebA-HQ and a synthetic data set, providing easily interpretable insights into the decision-making process of the regression model and reveal spurious correlations. We find that for regression counterfactuals, changes in features depend on the region of the predicted value. Large semantic changes are needed for significant changes in predicted values, making it harder to find sparse counterfactuals than with classifiers. Moreover, pixel space counterfactuals are more sparse while latent space counterfactuals are of higher quality and allow bigger semantic changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 5 Figures, Accepted at 3rd World Conference on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI-2025), Code and reproduction instructions available on GitHub, see https://github.com/DevinTDHa/Diffusion-Counterfactuals-for-Image-Regressors</p></details> |

We begin by proving that the time-marginal distribution of the sum of two independent diffusion processes satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation. Building on this result and applying Ambrosio-Figalli-Trevisan's superposition principle, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the associated stochastic differential equation (SDE). Leveraging these theoretical foundations, we develop a method to construct (stochastic) transport maps between arbitrary probability distributions using dynamical ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and SDEs. Furthermore, we introduce a unified framework that generalizes and extends a broad class of diffusion-based generative models and sampling techniques. Finally, we analyze the convergence properties of particle approximations for the SDEs underlying our framework, providing theoretical guarantees for their practical implementation. This work bridges theoretical insights with practical applications, offering new tools for generative modeling and sampling in high-dimensional spaces.</p></details> | 34 pages |

White matter (WM) hypointensities in T1-weighted imaging, such as those arising from multiple sclerosis or small vessel disease, are known to affect the output of brain segmentation methods and therefore bias cortical thickness measurements. These effects are well-documented among traditional brain segmentation tools but have not been studied extensively in tools based on deep-learning segmentations, which promise to be more robust. In this paper, we explore the potential of deep learning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cortical thickness measurement in the presence of WM lesions, using a high-quality lesion filling algorithm leveraging denoising diffusion networks. A pseudo-3D U-Net architecture trained on the OASIS dataset to generate synthetic healthy tissue, conditioned on binary lesion masks derived from the MSSEG dataset, allows realistic removal of white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis patients. By applying morphometry methods to patient images before and after lesion filling, we analysed robustness of global and regional cortical thickness measurements in the presence of white matter lesions. Methods based on a deep learning-based segmentation of the brain (Fastsurfer, DL+DiReCT, ANTsPyNet) exhibited greater robustness than those using classical segmentation methods (Freesurfer, ANTs).</p></details> |  |

However, they are often criticized for two significant problems: 1) slow training and inference speed, and 2) inadequate recovery of fine-grained facial details. To address these problems, we propose a novel Truncated Diffusion model for efficient Blind Face Restoration (TD-BFR), a three-stage paradigm tailored for the progressive resolution of degraded images. Specifically, TD-BFR utilizes an innovative truncated sampling method, starting from low-quality (LQ) images at low resolution to enhance sampling speed, and then introduces an adaptive degradation removal module to handle unknown degradations and connect the generation processes across different resolutions. Additionally, we further adapt the priors of pre-trained diffusion models to recover rich facial details. Our method efficiently restores high-quality images in a coarse-to-fine manner and experimental results demonstrate that TD-BFR is, on average, \textbf{4.75$\times$} faster than current state-of-the-art diffusion-based BFR methods while maintaining competitive quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning Guided Latent Diffusion Model for Image-to-Image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20484v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion model has demonstrated superior performance in synthesizing diverse and high-quality images for text-guided image translation. However, there remains room for improvement in both the formulation of text prompts and the preservation of reference image content. First, variations in target text prompts can significantly influence the quality of the generated images, and it is often challenging for users to craft an optimal prompt that fully captures the content of the input image. Second, while existing models can introduce desired modifications to specific regions of the reference image, they frequently induce unintended alterations in areas that should remain unchanged. To address these challenges, we propose pix2pix-zeroCon, a zero-shot diffusion-based method that eliminates the need for additional training by leveraging patch-wise contrastive loss. Specifically, we automatically determine the editing direction in the text embedding space based on the reference image and target prompts. Furthermore, to ensure precise content and structural preservation in the edited image, we introduce cross-attention guiding loss and patch-wise contrastive loss between the generated and original image embeddings within a pre-trained diffusion model. Notably, our approach requires no additional training and operates directly on a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing models in image-to-image translation, achieving enhanced fidelity and controllability.</p></details> | 11 pages, 13 figures |

However, despite their high-quality outputs, these models often perpetuate social biases, including those related to gender and race. These biases can potentially contribute to harmful real-world consequences, reinforcing stereotypes and exacerbating inequalities in various social contexts. While existing research on diffusion bias mitigation has predominantly focused on guiding content generation, it often neglects the intrinsic mechanisms within diffusion models that causally drive biased outputs. In this paper, we investigate the internal processes of diffusion models, identifying specific decision-making mechanisms, termed bias features, embedded within the model architecture. By directly manipulating these features, our method precisely isolates and adjusts the elements responsible for bias generation, permitting granular control over the bias levels in the generated content. Through experiments on both unconditional and conditional diffusion models across various social bias attributes, we demonstrate our method's efficacy in managing generation distribution while preserving image quality. We also dissect the discovered model mechanism, revealing different intrinsic features controlling fine-grained aspects of generation, boosting further research on mechanistic interpretability of diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project Page: https://foundation-model-research.github.io/difflens</p></details> |
| **[Latent Beam Diffusion Models for Decoding Image Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20429v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from text prompts, they struggle with visual consistency in image sequences. Existing methods generate each image independently, leading to disjointed narratives - a challenge further exacerbated in non-linear storytelling, where scenes must connect beyond adjacent frames. We introduce a novel beam search strategy for latent space exploration, enabling conditional generation of full image sequences with beam search decoding. Unlike prior approaches that use fixed latent priors, our method dynamically searches for an optimal sequence of latent representations, ensuring coherent visual transitions. To address beam search's quadratic complexity, we integrate a cross-attention mechanism that efficiently scores search paths and enables pruning, prioritizing alignment with both textual prompts and visual context. Human evaluations confirm that our approach outperforms baseline methods, producing full sequences with superior coherence, visual continuity, and textual alignment. By bridging advances in search optimization and latent space refinement, this work sets a new standard for structured image sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ITA-MDT: Image-Timestep-Adaptive Masked Diffusion Transformer Framework for Image-Based Virtual Try-On](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20418v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ITA-MDT, the Image-Timestep-Adaptive Masked Diffusion Transformer Framework for Image-Based Virtual Try-On (IVTON), designed to overcome the limitations of previous approaches by leveraging the Masked Diffusion Transformer (MDT) for improved handling of both global garment context and fine-grained details. The IVTON task involves seamlessly superimposing a garment from one image onto a person in another, creating a realistic depiction of the person wearing the specified garment. Unlike conventional diffusion-based virtual try-on models that depend on large pre-trained U-Net architectures, ITA-MDT leverages a lightweight, scalable transformer-based denoising diffusion model with a mask latent modeling scheme, achieving competitive results while reducing computational overhead. A key component of ITA-MDT is the Image-Timestep Adaptive Feature Aggregator (ITAFA), a dynamic feature aggregator that combines all of the features from the image encoder into a unified feature of the same size, guided by diffusion timestep and garment image complexity. This enables adaptive weighting of features, allowing the model to emphasize either global information or fine-grained details based on the requirements of the denoising stage. Additionally, the Salient Region Extractor (SRE) module is presented to identify complex region of the garment to provide high-resolution local information to the denoising model as an additional condition alongside the global information of the full garment image. This targeted conditioning strategy enhances detail preservation of fine details in highly salient garment regions, optimizing computational resources by avoiding unnecessarily processing entire garment image. Comparative evaluations confirms that ITA-MDT improves efficiency while maintaining strong performance, reaching state-of-the-art results in several metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://jiwoohong93.github.io/ita-mdt/</p></details> |
| **[DiTCtrl: Exploring Attention Control in Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Tuning-Free Multi-Prompt Longer Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18597v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sora-like video generation models have achieved remarkable progress with a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer MM-DiT architecture. However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; 21 pages, 23 figures, Project page: https://onevfall.github.io/project_page/ditctrl ; GitHub repository: https://github.com/TencentARC/DiTCtrl</p></details> |

Recent diffusion-based methods show impressive performance in 3D robotic manipulation tasks, whereas they suffer from severe runtime inefficiency due to multiple denoising steps, especially with high-dimensional observations. To this end, we propose a real-time robotic manipulation model named ManiCM that imposes the consistency constraint to the diffusion process, so that the model can generate robot actions in only one-step inference. Specifically, we formulate a consistent diffusion process in the robot action space conditioned on the point cloud input, where the original action is required to be directly denoised from any point along the ODE trajectory. To model this process, we design a consistency distillation technique to predict the action sample directly instead of predicting the noise within the vision community for fast convergence in the low-dimensional action manifold. We evaluate ManiCM on 31 robotic manipulation tasks from Adroit and Metaworld, and the results demonstrate that our approach accelerates the state-of-the-art method by 10 times in average inference speed while maintaining competitive average success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://manicm-fast.github.io/</p></details> |

Previous video generation models often had limited movement and short durations, and is difficult to generate videos with coherent narratives based on text. We propose several designs to address these issues. First, we propose a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions, to improve both compression rate and video fidelity. Second, to improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the two modalities. Third, by employing a progressive training and multi-resolution frame pack technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration, different shape videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method, greatly contributing to the generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show that CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple machine metrics and human evaluations. The model weight of both 3D Causal VAE, Video caption model and CogVideoX are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |

Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://agnjason.github.io/HumanDiT-page/</p></details> |
| **[RelTriple: Learning Plausible Indoor Layouts by Integrating Relationship Triples into the Diffusion Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20289v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of indoor furniture layouts has significant applications in augmented reality, smart homes, and architectural design. Successful furniture arrangement requires proper physical relationships (e.g., collision avoidance) and spacing relationships between furniture and their functional zones to be respected. However, manually defined relationships are almost always incomplete and can produce unrealistic layouts. This work instead extracts spacing relationships automatically based on a hierarchical analysis and adopts the Delaunay Triangulation to produce important triple relationships. Compared to pairwise relationship modeling, triple relationships account for interactions and space utilization among multiple objects. To this end, we introduce RelTriple, a novel approach that enhances furniture distribution by learning spacing relationships between objects and regions. We formulate triple relationships as object-to-object (O2O) losses and object-to-region (O2R) losses and integrate them directly into the training process of generative diffusion. Our approach consistently improves over existing state-of-the-art methods in visual results evaluation metrics on unconditional layout generation, floorplan-conditioned layout generation, and scene rearrangement, achieving at least 12% on the introduced spatial relationship metric and superior spatial coherence and practical usability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Rank Adaptation of Pre-Trained Stable Diffusion for Rigid-Body Target ISAR Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21823v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional range-instantaneous Doppler (RID) methods for rigid-body target imaging often suffer from low resolution due to the limitations of time-frequency analysis (TFA). To address this challenge, our primary focus is on obtaining high resolution time-frequency representations (TFRs) from their low resolution counterparts. Recognizing that the curve features of TFRs are a specific type of texture feature, we argue that pre trained generative models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) are well suited for enhancing TFRs, thanks to their powerful capability in capturing texture representations. Building on this insight, we propose a novel inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging method for rigid-body targets, leveraging the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of a pre-trained SD model. Our approach adopts the basic structure and pre-trained parameters of SD Turbo while incorporating additional linear operations for LoRA and adversarial training to achieve super-resolution and noise suppression. Then we integrate LoRA-SD into the RID-based ISAR imaging, enabling sharply focused and denoised imaging with super-resolution capabilities. We evaluate our method using both simulated and real radar data. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in frequency es timation and ISAR imaging compared to traditional methods. Notably, the generalization capability is verified by training on simulated radar data and testing on measured radar data.</p></details> | 4 pages, IGARSS 2025 |

Although significant progress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all methods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context utilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower generation speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (Dynamic frame Avatar With Non-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once generation of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two main components: (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the latent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid videos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements. Additionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation capabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These results highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the field of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks further exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models.

While event cameras can capture high temporal resolution motion information, existing event-based VFI methods struggle with limited training data and complex motion patterns. In this paper, we introduce Event-Guided Video Diffusion Model (EGVD), a novel framework that leverages the powerful priors of pre-trained stable video diffusion models alongside the precise temporal information from event cameras. Our approach features a Multi-modal Motion Condition Generator (MMCG) that effectively integrates RGB frames and event signals to guide the diffusion process, producing physically realistic intermediate frames. We employ a selective fine-tuning strategy that preserves spatial modeling capabilities while efficiently incorporating event-guided temporal information. We incorporate input-output normalization techniques inspired by recent advances in diffusion modeling to enhance training stability across varying noise levels. To improve generalization, we construct a comprehensive dataset combining both real and simulated event data across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on both real and simulated datasets demonstrate that EGVD significantly outperforms existing methods in handling large motion and challenging lighting conditions, achieving substantial improvements in perceptual quality metrics (27.4% better LPIPS on Prophesee and 24.1% on BSRGB) while maintaining competitive fidelity measures.

We study diffusions on the circle, namely the Brownian motion on the circle and the von Mises process, and consider these as models for correlation. The von Mises process was proposed in Kent (1975) as a probabilistic justification for the von Mises distribution which is widely used in Circular statistics. The transition density of the von Mises process has been unknown, we identify an approximate analytic transition density for the von Mises process. We discuss the estimation of these diffusion models and a stochastic correlation model in finance. We illustrate the application of the proposed model on real-data of equity-currency pairs.</p></details> |  |

Improving Conditional Generation of Fine-Tuned Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20240v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a fundamental technique in training conditional diffusion models. The common practice for CFG-based training is to use a single network to learn both conditional and unconditional noise prediction, with a small dropout rate for conditioning. However, we observe that the joint learning of unconditional noise with limited bandwidth in training results in poor priors for the unconditional case. More importantly, these poor unconditional noise predictions become a serious reason for degrading the quality of conditional generation. Inspired by the fact that most CFG-based conditional models are trained by fine-tuning a base model with better unconditional generation, we first show that simply replacing the unconditional noise in CFG with that predicted by the base model can significantly improve conditional generation. Furthermore, we show that a diffusion model other than the one the fine-tuned model was trained on can be used for unconditional noise replacement. We experimentally verify our claim with a range of CFG-based conditional models for both image and video generation, including Zero-1-to-3, Versatile Diffusion, DiT, DynamiCrafter, and InstructPix2Pix.</p></details> |  |

The diffusion model is based on its step-by-step denoising generation process. By combining the conditional generation mechanism, design optimization module, and user feedback mechanism, the model can generate a UI interface that meets the requirements based on multimodal inputs such as text descriptions and sketches provided by users. In the study, a complete experimental evaluation framework was designed, and mainstream generation models (such as GAN, VAE, DALL E, etc.) were selected for comparative experiments. The generation results were quantitatively analyzed from indicators such as PSNR, SSIM, and FID. The results show that the model proposed in this study is superior to other models in terms of generation quality and user satisfaction, especially in terms of logical clarity of information transmission and visual aesthetics. The ablation experiment further verifies the key role of conditional generation and design optimization modules in improving interface quality. This study provides a new technical path for UI design automation and lays the foundation for the intelligent and personalized development of human-computer interaction interfaces. In the future, the application potential of the model in virtual reality, game design, and other fields will be further explored.</p></details> |  |

While skills in offline RL are predominantly modeled within a continuous latent space, the potential of discrete skill spaces remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a compact discrete skill space for offline RL tasks supported by state-of-the-art transformer-based encoder and diffusion-based decoder. Coupled with a high-level policy trained via offline RL techniques, our method establishes a hierarchical RL framework where the trained diffusion decoder plays a pivotal role. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm, Discrete Diffusion Skill (DDS), is a powerful offline RL method. DDS performs competitively on Locomotion and Kitchen tasks and excels on long-horizon tasks, achieving at least a 12 percent improvement on AntMaze-v2 benchmarks compared to existing offline RL approaches. Furthermore, DDS offers improved interpretability, training stability, and online exploration compared to previous skill-based methods.</p></details> |  |

In continuous state-spaces, controllable and flexible generation of samples with desired properties has been realized using guidance on diffusion and flow models. However, these guidance approaches are not readily amenable to discrete state-space models. Consequently, we introduce a general and principled method for applying guidance on such models. Our method depends on leveraging continuous-time Markov processes on discrete state-spaces, which unlocks computational tractability for sampling from a desired guided distribution. We demonstrate the utility of our approach, Discrete Guidance, on a range of applications including guided generation of small-molecules, DNA sequences and protein sequences.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that images synthesized by 2D diffusion models inherently capture plausible and realistic OOR cues, enabling efficient ways to collect a 3D dataset to learn OOR for various unbounded object categories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse images that capture plausible OOR cues, which we then uplift into 3D samples. Leveraging our diverse collection of plausible 3D samples for the object pairs, we train a score-based OOR diffusion model to learn the distribution of their relative spatial relationships. Additionally, we extend our pairwise OOR to multi-object OOR by enforcing consistency across pairwise relations and preventing object collisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our method across various object-object spatial relationships, along with its applicability to real-world 3D scene arrangement tasks using the OOR diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tlb-miss.github.io/oor/</p></details> |

Existing methods lack a systematic way to reliably extract the interpretable underlying intrinsic concepts. To address this challenge, we present ICE, short for Intrinsic Concept Extraction, a novel framework that exclusively utilizes a T2I model to automatically and systematically extract intrinsic concepts from a single image. ICE consists of two pivotal stages. In the first stage, ICE devises an automatic concept localization module to pinpoint relevant text-based concepts and their corresponding masks within the image. This critical stage streamlines concept initialization and provides precise guidance for subsequent analysis. The second stage delves deeper into each identified mask, decomposing the object-level concepts into intrinsic concepts and general concepts. This decomposition allows for a more granular and interpretable breakdown of visual elements. Our framework demonstrates superior performance on intrinsic concept extraction from a single image in an unsupervised manner.

However, without additional guidance, the large motion between frames makes this problem ill-posed. Event-based Video Frame Interpolation (EVFI) addresses this challenge by using sparse, high-temporal-resolution event measurements as motion guidance. This guidance allows EVFI methods to significantly outperform frame-only methods. However, to date, EVFI methods have relied on a limited set of paired event-frame training data, severely limiting their performance and generalization capabilities. In this work, we overcome the limited data challenge by adapting pre-trained video diffusion models trained on internet-scale datasets to EVFI. We experimentally validate our approach on real-world EVFI datasets, including a new one that we introduce.

Although this evolution has significantly enhanced the models' ability to understand complex prompts and generate text, it also leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters. Despite T5 series encoders being trained on the C4 natural language corpus, which includes a significant amount of non-visual data, diffusion models with T5 encoder do not respond to those non-visual prompts, indicating redundancy in representational power. Therefore, it raises an important question: "Do we really need such a large text encoder?" In pursuit of an answer, we employ vision-based knowledge distillation to train a series of T5 encoder models. To fully inherit its capabilities, we constructed our dataset based on three criteria: image quality, semantic understanding, and text-rendering. Our results demonstrate the scaling down pattern that the distilled T5-base model can generate images of comparable quality to those produced by T5-XXL, while being 50 times smaller in size. This reduction in model size significantly lowers the GPU requirements for running state-of-the-art models such as FLUX and SD3, making high-quality text-to-image generation more accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, the more challenging task of multi-scene video generation, which offers broader applications, remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Mask$^2$DiT, a novel approach that establishes fine-grained, one-to-one alignment between video segments and their corresponding text annotations. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric binary mask at each attention layer within the DiT architecture, ensuring that each text annotation applies exclusively to its respective video segment while preserving temporal coherence across visual tokens. This attention mechanism enables precise segment-level textual-to-visual alignment, allowing the DiT architecture to effectively handle video generation tasks with a fixed number of scenes. To further equip the DiT architecture with the ability to generate additional scenes based on existing ones, we incorporate a segment-level conditional mask, which conditions each newly generated segment on the preceding video segments, thereby enabling auto-regressive scene extension. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm that Mask$^2$DiT excels in maintaining visual consistency across segments while ensuring semantic alignment between each segment and its corresponding text description.

| **[Aesthetic Post-Training Diffusion Models from Generic Preferences with Step-by-step Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04314v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating visually appealing images is fundamental to modern text-to-image generation models. A potential solution to better aesthetics is direct preference optimization (DPO), which has been applied to diffusion models to improve general image quality including prompt alignment and aesthetics. Popular DPO methods propagate preference labels from clean image pairs to all the intermediate steps along the two generation trajectories. However, preference labels provided in existing datasets are blended with layout and aesthetic opinions, which would disagree with aesthetic preference. Even if aesthetic labels were provided (at substantial cost), it would be hard for the two-trajectory methods to capture nuanced visual differences at different steps. To improve aesthetics economically, this paper uses existing generic preference data and introduces step-by-step preference optimization (SPO) that discards the propagation strategy and allows fine-grained image details to be assessed. Specifically, at each denoising step, we 1) sample a pool of candidates by denoising from a shared noise latent, 2) use a step-aware preference model to find a suitable win-lose pair to supervise the diffusion model, and 3) randomly select one from the pool to initialize the next denoising step. This strategy ensures that diffusion models focus on the subtle, fine-grained visual differences instead of layout aspect. We find that aesthetics can be significantly enhanced by accumulating these improved minor differences. When fine-tuning Stable Diffusion v1.5 and SDXL, SPO yields significant improvements in aesthetics compared with existing DPO methods while not sacrificing image-text alignment compared with vanilla models. Moreover, SPO converges much faster than DPO methods due to the use of more correct preference labels provided by the step-aware preference model.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.
