| **[PISA Experiments: Exploring Physics Post-Training for Video Diffusion Models by Watching Stuff Drop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09595v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained video generation models excel in content creation but are not reliable as physically accurate world simulators out of the box. This work studies the process of post-training these models for accurate world modeling through the lens of the simple, yet fundamental, physics task of modeling object freefall. We show state-of-the-art video generation models struggle with this basic task, despite their visually impressive outputs. To remedy this problem, we find that fine-tuning on a relatively small amount of simulated videos is effective in inducing the dropping behavior in the model, and we can further improve results through a novel reward modeling procedure we introduce. Our study also reveals key limitations of post-training in generalization and distribution modeling. Additionally, we release a benchmark for this task that may serve as a useful diagnostic tool for tracking physical accuracy in large-scale video generative model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaskFlow: Discrete Flows For Flexible and Efficient Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11234v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating long, high-quality videos remains a challenge due to the complex interplay of spatial and temporal dynamics and hardware limitations. In this work, we introduce MaskFlow, a unified video generation framework that combines discrete representations with flow-matching to enable efficient generation of high-quality long videos. By leveraging a frame-level masking strategy during training, MaskFlow conditions on previously generated unmasked frames to generate videos with lengths ten times beyond that of the training sequences. MaskFlow does so very efficiently by enabling the use of fast Masked Generative Model (MGM)-style sampling and can be deployed in both fully autoregressive as well as full-sequence generation modes. We validate the quality of our method on the FaceForensics (FFS) and Deepmind Lab (DMLab) datasets and report Frechet Video Distance (FVD) competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. We also provide a detailed analysis on the sampling efficiency of our method and demonstrate that MaskFlow can be applied to both timestep-dependent and timestep-independent models in a training-free manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://compvis.github.io/maskflow/</p></details> |
| **[Object-Centric World Model for Language-Guided Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06170v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model is essential for an agent to predict the future and plan in domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. To achieve this, recent advancements have focused on video generation, which has gained significant attention due to the impressive success of diffusion models. However, these models require substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a world model leveraging object-centric representation space using slot attention, guided by language instructions. Our model perceives the current state as an object-centric representation and predicts future states in this representation space conditioned on natural language instructions. This approach results in a more compact and computationally efficient model compared to diffusion-based generative alternatives. Furthermore, it flexibly predicts future states based on language instructions, and offers a significant advantage in manipulation tasks where object recognition is crucial. In this paper, we demonstrate that our latent predictive world model surpasses generative world models in visuo-linguo-motor control tasks, achieving superior sample and computation efficiency. We also investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method and explore various strategies for predicting actions using object-centric representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Dense Prediction of Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09344v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unified network for simultaneously generating videos and their corresponding entity segmentation and depth maps from text prompts. We utilize colormap to represent entity masks and depth maps, tightly integrating dense prediction with RGB video generation. Introducing dense prediction information improves video generation's consistency and motion smoothness without increasing computational costs. Incorporating learnable task embeddings brings multiple dense prediction tasks into a single model, enhancing flexibility and further boosting performance. We further propose a large-scale dense prediction video dataset~\datasetname, addressing the issue that existing datasets do not concurrently contain captions, videos, segmentation, or depth maps. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of our method, surpassing the state-of-the-art in terms of video quality, consistency, and motion smoothness.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Other Vehicle Trajectories Are Also Needed: A Driving World Model Unifies Ego-Other Vehicle Trajectories in Video Latant Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09215v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving \textbf{W}orld \textbf{M}odel named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying \textbf{E}go-\textbf{O}ther vehicle \textbf{T}rajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30\% in FID and 55\% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[$^R$FLAV: Rolling Flow matching for infinite Audio Video generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08307v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint audio-video (AV) generation is still a significant challenge in generative AI, primarily due to three critical requirements: quality of the generated samples, seamless multimodal synchronization and temporal coherence, with audio tracks that match the visual data and vice versa, and limitless video duration. In this paper, we present $^R$-FLAV, a novel transformer-based architecture that addresses all the key challenges of AV generation. We explore three distinct cross modality interaction modules, with our lightweight temporal fusion module emerging as the most effective and computationally efficient approach for aligning audio and visual modalities. Our experimental results demonstrate that $^R$-FLAV outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in multimodal AV generation tasks. Our code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/ErgastiAlex/R-FLAV.</p></details> |  |
| **[WonderVerse: Extendable 3D Scene Generation with Video Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09160v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce \textit{WonderVerse}, a simple but effective framework for generating extendable 3D scenes. Unlike existing methods that rely on iterative depth estimation and image inpainting, often leading to geometric distortions and inconsistencies, WonderVerse leverages the powerful world-level priors embedded within video generative foundation models to create highly immersive and geometrically coherent 3D environments. Furthermore, we propose a new technique for controllable 3D scene extension to substantially increase the scale of the generated environments. Besides, we introduce a novel abnormal sequence detection module that utilizes camera trajectory to address geometric inconsistency in the generated videos. Finally, WonderVerse is compatible with various 3D reconstruction methods, allowing both efficient and high-quality generation. Extensive experiments on 3D scene generation demonstrate that our WonderVerse, with an elegant and simple pipeline, delivers extendable and highly-realistic 3D scenes, markedly outperforming existing works that rely on more complex architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reangle-A-Video: 4D Video Generation as Video-to-Video Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09151v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized multi-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data.

| **[Señorita-2M: A High-Quality Instruction-based Dataset for General Video Editing by Video Specialists](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06734v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have spurred the development of video editing techniques, which can be divided into inversion-based and end-to-end methods. However, current video editing methods still suffer from several challenges. Inversion-based methods, though training-free and flexible, are time-consuming during inference, struggle with fine-grained editing instructions, and produce artifacts and jitter. On the other hand, end-to-end methods, which rely on edited video pairs for training, offer faster inference speeds but often produce poor editing results due to a lack of high-quality training video pairs. In this paper, to close the gap in end-to-end methods, we introduce Se\~norita-2M, a high-quality video editing dataset. Se\~norita-2M consists of approximately 2 millions of video editing pairs. It is built by crafting four high-quality, specialized video editing models, each crafted and trained by our team to achieve state-of-the-art editing results. We also propose a filtering pipeline to eliminate poorly edited video pairs. Furthermore, we explore common video editing architectures to identify the most effective structure based on current pre-trained generative model. Extensive experiments show that our dataset can help to yield remarkably high-quality video editing results. More details are available at https://senorita-2m-dataset.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[FasterCache: Training-Free Video Diffusion Model Acceleration with High Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19355v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present \textbf{\textit{FasterCache}}, a novel training-free strategy designed to accelerate the inference of video diffusion models with high-quality generation. By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[REGEN: Learning Compact Video Embedding with (Re-)Generative Decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08665v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel perspective on learning video embedders for generative modeling: rather than requiring an exact reproduction of an input video, an effective embedder should focus on synthesizing visually plausible reconstructions. This relaxed criterion enables substantial improvements in compression ratios without compromising the quality of downstream generative models. Specifically, we propose replacing the conventional encoder-decoder video embedder with an encoder-generator framework that employs a diffusion transformer (DiT) to synthesize missing details from a compact latent space. Therein, we develop a dedicated latent conditioning module to condition the DiT decoder on the encoded video latent embedding. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach enables superior encoding-decoding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the compression ratio increases. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we report results from our video embedders achieving a temporal compression ratio of up to 32x (8x higher than leading video embedders) and validate the robustness of this ultra-compact latent space for text-to-video generation, providing a significant efficiency boost in latent diffusion model training and inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning-Free Multi-Event Long Video Generation via Synchronized Coupled Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08605v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in text-to-video diffusion models enable high-quality short video generation from a single prompt, generating real-world long videos in a single pass remains challenging due to limited data and high computational costs. To address this, several works propose tuning-free approaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation, specifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content changes. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions between adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of semantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose Synchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that synchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range consistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two complementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling, which ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence, respectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns denoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended content changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS synchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise, ensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive experiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video generation, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence, outperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page with visuals: https://syncos2025.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Video-to-Audio Generation with Hidden Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07464v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://sites.google.com/view/vta-ldm</p></details> |
| **[HunyuanVideo: A Systematic Framework For Large Video Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03603v6)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have significantly impacted daily life for both individuals and industries. However, the leading video generation models remain closed-source, resulting in a notable performance gap between industry capabilities and those available to the public. In this report, we introduce HunyuanVideo, an innovative open-source video foundation model that demonstrates performance in video generation comparable to, or even surpassing, that of leading closed-source models. HunyuanVideo encompasses a comprehensive framework that integrates several key elements, including data curation, advanced architectural design, progressive model scaling and training, and an efficient infrastructure tailored for large-scale model training and inference. As a result, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13 billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. We conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to ensure high visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced filming techniques. According to evaluations by professionals, HunyuanVideo outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6, and three top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code for the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source communities. This initiative will empower individuals within the community to experiment with their ideas, fostering a more dynamic and vibrant video generation ecosystem. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo.</p></details> |  |
| **[WISA: World Simulator Assistant for Physics-Aware Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08153v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent rapid advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation, such as SoRA and Kling, have shown great potential for building world simulators. However, current T2V models struggle to grasp abstract physical principles and generate videos that adhere to physical laws. This challenge arises primarily from a lack of clear guidance on physical information due to a significant gap between abstract physical principles and generation models. To this end, we introduce the World Simulator Assistant (WISA), an effective framework for decomposing and incorporating physical principles into T2V models. Specifically, WISA decomposes physical principles into textual physical descriptions, qualitative physical categories, and quantitative physical properties. To effectively embed these physical attributes into the generation process, WISA incorporates several key designs, including Mixture-of-Physical-Experts Attention (MoPA) and a Physical Classifier, enhancing the model's physics awareness. Furthermore, most existing datasets feature videos where physical phenomena are either weakly represented or entangled with multiple co-occurring processes, limiting their suitability as dedicated resources for learning explicit physical principles. We propose a novel video dataset, WISA-32K, collected based on qualitative physical categories. It consists of 32,000 videos, representing 17 physical laws across three domains of physics: dynamics, thermodynamics, and optics. Experimental results demonstrate that WISA can effectively enhance the compatibility of T2V models with real-world physical laws, achieving a considerable improvement on the VideoPhy benchmark. The visual exhibitions of WISA and WISA-32K are available in the https://360cvgroup.github.io/WISA/.</p></details> |  |
| **[VACE: All-in-One Video Creation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07598v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer has demonstrated powerful capability and scalability in generating high-quality images and videos. Further pursuing the unification of generation and editing tasks has yielded significant progress in the domain of image content creation. However, due to the intrinsic demands for consistency across both temporal and spatial dynamics, achieving a unified approach for video synthesis remains challenging. We introduce VACE, which enables users to perform Video tasks within an All-in-one framework for Creation and Editing. These tasks include reference-to-video generation, video-to-video editing, and masked video-to-video editing. Specifically, we effectively integrate the requirements of various tasks by organizing video task inputs, such as editing, reference, and masking, into a unified interface referred to as the Video Condition Unit (VCU). Furthermore, by utilizing a Context Adapter structure, we inject different task concepts into the model using formalized representations of temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing it to handle arbitrary video synthesis tasks flexibly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the unified model of VACE achieves performance on par with task-specific models across various subtasks. Simultaneously, it enables diverse applications through versatile task combinations.

| **[MotionAura: Generating High-Quality and Motion Consistent Videos using Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07659v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatio-temporal complexity of video data presents significant challenges in tasks such as compression, generation, and inpainting. We present four key contributions to address the challenges of spatiotemporal video processing. First, we introduce the 3D Mobile Inverted Vector-Quantization Variational Autoencoder (3D-MBQ-VAE), which combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with masked token modeling to enhance spatiotemporal video compression. The model achieves superior temporal consistency and state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality by employing a novel training strategy with full frame masking. Second, we present MotionAura, a text-to-video generation framework that utilizes vector-quantized diffusion models to discretize the latent space and capture complex motion dynamics, producing temporally coherent videos aligned with text prompts. Third, we propose a spectral transformer-based denoising network that processes video data in the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform. This method effectively captures global context and long-range dependencies for high-quality video generation and denoising. Lastly, we introduce a downstream task of Sketch Guided Video Inpainting. This task leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our models achieve SOTA performance on a range of benchmarks. Our work offers robust frameworks for spatiotemporal modeling and user-driven video content manipulation. We will release the code, datasets, and models in open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025 (spotlight paper)</p></details> |
| **[T2VEval: Benchmark Dataset and Objective Evaluation Method for T2V-generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08545v5)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) technology, as demonstrated by models such as Runway Gen-3, Pika, Sora, and Kling, have significantly broadened the applicability and popularity of the technology. This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of T2V-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-to-video outputs remain challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed T2VEval-Bench, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset for text-to-video quality evaluation, which contains 148 textual prompts and 1,783 videos generated by 13 T2V models. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we scored each video on four dimensions in the subjective experiment, which are overall impression, text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Based on T2VEval-Bench, we developed T2VEval, a multi-branch fusion scheme for T2V quality evaluation. T2VEval assesses videos across three branches: text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large language model. Additionally, we implemented a divide-and-conquer training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Physics Simulation for 3D Scenes via MLLM-Guided Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12789v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in 3D generation models have opened new possibilities for simulating dynamic 3D object movements and customizing behaviors, yet creating this content remains challenging. Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present ObjectMover, a generative model that can perform object movement in highly challenging scenes. Our key insight is that we model this task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and fine-tune a video generation model to leverage its knowledge of consistent object generation across video frames. We show that with this approach, our model is able to adjust to complex real-world scenarios, handling extreme lighting harmonization and object effect movement. As large-scale data for object movement are unavailable, we construct a data generation pipeline using a modern game engine to synthesize high-quality data pairs. We further propose a multi-task learning strategy that enables training on real-world video data to improve the model generalization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ObjectMover achieves outstanding results and adapts well to real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://xinyu-andy.github.io/ObjMover</p></details> |
| **[SweetTok: Semantic-Aware Spatial-Temporal Tokenizer for Compact Video Discretization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10443v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the \textbf{S}emantic-a\textbf{W}ar\textbf{E} spatial-t\textbf{E}mporal \textbf{T}okenizer (SweetTok), a novel video tokenizer to overcome the limitations in current video tokenization methods for compacted yet effective discretization. Unlike previous approaches that process flattened local visual patches via direct discretization or adaptive query tokenization, SweetTok proposes a decoupling framework, compressing visual inputs through distinct spatial and temporal queries via \textbf{D}ecoupled \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (DQAE). This design allows SweetTok to efficiently compress video token count while achieving superior fidelity by capturing essential information across spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, we design a \textbf{M}otion-enhanced \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{C}odebook (MLC) tailored for spatial and temporal compression to address the differences in semantic representation between appearance and motion information. SweetTok significantly improves video reconstruction results by \textbf{42.8\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 dataset. With a better token compression strategy, it also boosts downstream video generation results by \textbf{15.1\%} w.r.t gFVD. Additionally, the compressed decoupled tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

Examining Teachers' Perspectives through TPACK and TAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08003v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of generative AI technology, particularly video generative AI (Video GenAI), has opened new possibilities for K-12 education by enabling the creation of dynamic, customized, and high-quality visual content. Despite its potential, there is limited research on how this emerging technology can be effectively integrated into educational practices. This study explores the perspectives of leading K-12 teachers on the educational applications of Video GenAI, using the TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) and TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) frameworks as analytical lenses. Through interviews and hands-on experimentation with video generation tools, the research identifies opportunities for enhancing teaching strategies, fostering student engagement, and supporting authentic task design. It also highlights challenges such as technical limitations, ethical considerations, and the need for institutional support. The findings provide actionable insights into how Video GenAI can transform teaching and learning, offering practical implications for policy, teacher training, and the future development of educational technology.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightMotion: A Light and Tuning-free Method for Simulating Camera Motion in Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06508v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing camera motion-controlled video generation methods face computational bottlenecks in fine-tuning and inference. This paper proposes LightMotion, a light and tuning-free method for simulating camera motion in video generation. Operating in the latent space, it eliminates additional fine-tuning, inpainting, and depth estimation, making it more streamlined than existing methods. The endeavors of this paper comprise: (i) The latent space permutation operation effectively simulates various camera motions like panning, zooming, and rotation. (ii) The latent space resampling strategy combines background-aware sampling and cross-frame alignment to accurately fill new perspectives while maintaining coherence across frames. (iii) Our in-depth analysis shows that the permutation and resampling cause an SNR shift in latent space, leading to poor-quality generation. To address this, we propose latent space correction, which reintroduces noise during denoising to mitigate SNR shift and enhance video generation quality. Exhaustive experiments show that our LightMotion outperforms existing methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | 18 pages in total |
| **[AV-Link: Temporally-Aligned Diffusion Features for Cross-Modal Audio-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15191v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose AV-Link, a unified framework for Video-to-Audio (A2V) and Audio-to-Video (A2V) generation that leverages the activations of frozen video and audio diffusion models for temporally-aligned cross-modal conditioning. The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that facilitates bidirectional information exchange between video and audio diffusion models through temporally-aligned self attention operations. Unlike prior work that uses dedicated models for A2V and V2A tasks and relies on pretrained feature extractors, AV-Link achieves both tasks in a single self-contained framework, directly leveraging features obtained by the complementary modality (i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video). Extensive automatic and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial improvement in audio-video synchronization, outperforming more expensive baselines such as the MovieGen video-to-audio model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: snap-research.github.io/AVLink/</p></details> |
| **[DreamRelation: Relation-Centric Video Customization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07602v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational video customization refers to the creation of personalized videos that depict user-specified relations between two subjects, a crucial task for comprehending real-world visual content. While existing methods can personalize subject appearances and motions, they still struggle with complex relational video customization, where precise relational modeling and high generalization across subject categories are essential. The primary challenge arises from the intricate spatial arrangements, layout variations, and nuanced temporal dynamics inherent in relations; consequently, current models tend to overemphasize irrelevant visual details rather than capturing meaningful interactions. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRelation, a novel approach that personalizes relations through a small set of exemplar videos, leveraging two key components: Relational Decoupling Learning and Relational Dynamics Enhancement. First, in Relational Decoupling Learning, we disentangle relations from subject appearances using relation LoRA triplet and hybrid mask training strategy, ensuring better generalization across diverse relationships. Furthermore, we determine the optimal design of relation LoRA triplet by analyzing the distinct roles of the query, key, and value features within MM-DiT's attention mechanism, making DreamRelation the first relational video generation framework with explainable components. Second, in Relational Dynamics Enhancement, we introduce space-time relational contrastive loss, which prioritizes relational dynamics while minimizing the reliance on detailed subject appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamRelation outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relational video customization. Code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dreamrelation.github.io</p></details> |

Effective traversal of the latent space learned by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has been the basis for recent breakthroughs in image editing. However, the applicability of such advancements to the video domain has been hindered by the difficulty of representing and controlling videos in the latent space of GANs. In particular, videos are composed of content (i.e., appearance) and complex motion components that require a special mechanism to disentangle and control. To achieve this, VidStyleODE encodes the video content in a pre-trained StyleGAN $\mathcal{W}_+$ space and benefits from a latent ODE component to summarize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the input video. Our novel continuous video generation process then combines the two to generate high-quality and temporally consistent videos with varying frame rates. We show that our proposed method enables a variety of applications on real videos: text-guided appearance manipulation, motion manipulation, image animation, and video interpolation and extrapolation.

| **[AR-Diffusion: Asynchronous Video Generation with Auto-Regressive Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07418v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of video generation requires synthesizing visually realistic and temporally coherent video frames. Existing methods primarily use asynchronous auto-regressive models or synchronous diffusion models to address this challenge. However, asynchronous auto-regressive models often suffer from inconsistencies between training and inference, leading to issues such as error accumulation, while synchronous diffusion models are limited by their reliance on rigid sequence length. To address these issues, we introduce Auto-Regressive Diffusion (AR-Diffusion), a novel model that combines the strengths of auto-regressive and diffusion models for flexible, asynchronous video generation. Specifically, our approach leverages diffusion to gradually corrupt video frames in both training and inference, reducing the discrepancy between these phases. Inspired by auto-regressive generation, we incorporate a non-decreasing constraint on the corruption timesteps of individual frames, ensuring that earlier frames remain clearer than subsequent ones. This setup, together with temporal causal attention, enables flexible generation of videos with varying lengths while preserving temporal coherence. In addition, we design two specialized timestep schedulers: the FoPP scheduler for balanced timestep sampling during training, and the AD scheduler for flexible timestep differences during inference, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves competitive and state-of-the-art results across four challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) planning. MovieAgent offers two key advantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated movie/long-video generation. Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent can generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent narrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and stable audio throughout the film. 2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical CoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings, and cinematography, significantly reducing human effort. By employing multiple LLM agents to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter, storyboard artist, and location manager, MovieAgent streamlines the production pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that MovieAgent achieves new state-of-the-art results in script faithfulness, character consistency, and narrative coherence. Our hierarchical framework takes a step forward and provides new insights into fully automated movie generation.

In this paper, we explore the task of learning to animate images to portray delicate human actions using a small number of videos -- 16 or fewer -- which is highly valuable for real-world applications like video and movie production. Learning generalizable motion patterns that smoothly transition from user-provided reference images in a few-shot setting is highly challenging. We propose FLASH (Few-shot Learning to Animate and Steer Humans), which learns generalizable motion patterns by forcing the model to reconstruct a video using the motion features and cross-frame correspondences of another video with the same motion but different appearance. This encourages transferable motion learning and mitigates overfitting to limited training data. Additionally, FLASH extends the decoder with additional layers to propagate details from the reference image to generated frames, improving transition smoothness. Human judges overwhelmingly favor FLASH, with 65.78\% of 488 responses prefer FLASH over baselines. We strongly recommend watching the videos in the website: https://lihaoxin05.github.io/human_action_animation/, as motion artifacts are hard to notice from images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Dreamer: Boundary Conditional Motion Reasoning for Physically Coherent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00547v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation have shown promise for generating future scenarios, critical for planning and control in autonomous driving and embodied intelligence. However, real-world applications demand more than visually plausible predictions; they require reasoning about object motions based on explicitly defined boundary conditions, such as initial scene image and partial object motion. We term this capability Boundary Conditional Motion Reasoning. Current approaches either neglect explicit user-defined motion constraints, producing physically inconsistent motions, or conversely demand complete motion inputs, which are rarely available in practice. Here we introduce Motion Dreamer, a two-stage framework that explicitly separates motion reasoning from visual synthesis, addressing these limitations. Our approach introduces instance flow, a sparse-to-dense motion representation enabling effective integration of partial user-defined motions, and the motion inpainting strategy to robustly enable reasoning motions of other objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Motion Dreamer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior motion plausibility and visual realism, thus bridging the gap towards practical boundary conditional motion reasoning.

| **[E2ED^2:Direct Mapping from Noise to Data for Enhanced Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21044v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have established themselves as the de facto primary paradigm in visual generative modeling, revolutionizing the field through remarkable success across various diverse applications ranging from high-quality image synthesis to temporal aware video generation. Despite these advancements, three fundamental limitations persist, including 1) discrepancy between training and inference processes, 2) progressive information leakage throughout the noise corruption procedures, and 3) inherent constraints preventing effective integration of modern optimization criteria like perceptual and adversarial loss. To mitigate these critical challenges, we in this paper present a novel end-to-end learning paradigm that establishes direct optimization from the final generated samples to initial noises. Our proposed End-to-End Differentiable Diffusion, dubbed E2ED^2, introduces several key improvements: it eliminates the sequential training-sampling mismatch and intermediate information leakage via conceptualizing training as a direct transformation from isotropic Gaussian noise to the target data distribution. Additionally, such training framework enables seamless incorporation of adversarial and perceptual losses into the core optimization objective. Comprehensive evaluation across standard benchmarks including COCO30K and HW30K reveals that our method achieves substantial performance gains in terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP score, even with fewer sampling steps (less than 4). Our findings highlight that the end-to-end mechanism might pave the way for more robust and efficient solutions, \emph{i.e.,} combining diffusion stability with GAN-like discriminative optimization in an end-to-end manner.</p></details> | Technical report |

However, their adherence to physical commonsense across real-world actions remains unclear (e.g., playing tennis, backflip). Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations such as limited size, lack of human evaluation, sim-to-real gaps, and absence of fine-grained physical rule analysis. To address this, we introduce VideoPhy-2, an action-centric dataset for evaluating physical commonsense in generated videos. We curate 200 diverse actions and detailed prompts for video synthesis from modern generative models. We perform human evaluation that assesses semantic adherence, physical commonsense, and grounding of physical rules in the generated videos. Our findings reveal major shortcomings, with even the best model achieving only 22% joint performance (i.e., high semantic and physical commonsense adherence) on the hard subset of VideoPhy-2. We find that the models particularly struggle with conservation laws like mass and momentum. Finally, we also train VideoPhy-AutoEval, an automatic evaluator for fast, reliable assessment on our dataset. Overall, VideoPhy-2 serves as a rigorous benchmark, exposing critical gaps in video generative models and guiding future research in physically-grounded video generation.

| **[IPO: Iterative Preference Optimization for Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02088v3)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video foundation models have achieved significant advancement with the help of network upgrade as well as model scale-up. However, they are still hard to meet requirements of applications due to unsatisfied generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose to align video foundation models with human preferences from the perspective of post-training in this paper. Consequently, we introduce an Iterative Preference Optimization strategy to enhance generated video quality by incorporating human feedback. Specifically, IPO exploits a critic model to justify video generations for pairwise ranking as in Direct Preference Optimization or point-wise scoring as in Kahneman-Tversky Optimization. Given this, IPO optimizes video foundation models with guidance of signals from preference feedback, which helps improve generated video quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. In addition, IPO incorporates the critic model with the multi-modality large language model, which enables it to automatically assign preference labels without need of retraining or relabeling. In this way, IPO can efficiently perform multi-round preference optimization in an iterative manner, without the need of tediously manual labeling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IPO can effectively improve the video generation quality of a pretrained model and help a model with only 2B parameters surpass the one with 5B parameters. Besides, IPO achieves new state-of-the-art performance on VBench benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[TR-DQ: Time-Rotation Diffusion Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06564v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been widely adopted in image and video generation. However, their complex network architecture leads to high inference overhead for its generation process. Existing diffusion quantization methods primarily focus on the quantization of the model structure while ignoring the impact of time-steps variation during sampling. At the same time, most current approaches fail to account for significant activations that cannot be eliminated, resulting in substantial performance degradation after quantization. To address these issues, we propose Time-Rotation Diffusion Quantization (TR-DQ), a novel quantization method incorporating time-step and rotation-based optimization. TR-DQ first divides the sampling process based on time-steps and applies a rotation matrix to smooth activations and weights dynamically. For different time-steps, a dedicated hyperparameter is introduced for adaptive timing modeling, which enables dynamic quantization across different time steps. Additionally, we also explore the compression potential of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG-wise) to establish a foundation for subsequent work. TR-DQ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on image generation and video generation tasks and a 1.38-1.89x speedup and 1.97-2.58x memory reduction in inference compared to existing quantization methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the enhanced capabilities of DiTs come with significant drawbacks, including increased computational and memory costs, which hinder their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Current acceleration techniques, such as quantization and cache mechanism, offer limited speedup and are often applied in isolation, failing to fully address the complexities of DiT architectures. In this paper, we propose QuantCache, a novel training-free inference acceleration framework that jointly optimizes hierarchical latent caching, adaptive importance-guided quantization, and structural redundancy-aware pruning. QuantCache achieves an end-to-end latency speedup of 6.72$\times$ on Open-Sora with minimal loss in generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, setting a new standard for efficient DiT inference.

Previous work has mapped the noise to new frames, a more computationally expensive process. Unfortunately, starting from the previous frame, instead of noise, is more prone to drifting errors. Hence, second, we additionally learn how to remove the accumulated errors as the joint objective by adding noise during training. We demonstrate unconditional video generation in a streaming manner for various video datasets, all at competitive quality compared to a baseline conditional diffusion but with higher speed, i.e., fewer ODE solver steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text2Story: Advancing Video Storytelling with Text Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06310v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating coherent long-form video sequences from discrete input using only text prompts is a critical task in content creation. While diffusion-based models excel at short video synthesis, long-form storytelling from text remains largely unexplored and a challenge due to challenges pertaining to temporal coherency, preserving semantic meaning and action continuity across the video. We introduce a novel storytelling approach to enable seamless video generation with natural action transitions and structured narratives. We present a bidirectional time-weighted latent blending strategy to ensure temporal consistency between segments of the long-form video being generated. Further, our method extends the Black-Scholes algorithm from prompt mixing for image generation to video generation, enabling controlled motion evolution through structured text conditioning. To further enhance motion continuity, we propose a semantic action representation framework to encode high-level action semantics into the blending process, dynamically adjusting transitions based on action similarity, ensuring smooth yet adaptable motion changes. Latent space blending maintains spatial coherence between objects in a scene, while time-weighted blending enforces bidirectional constraints for temporal consistency. This integrative approach prevents abrupt transitions while ensuring fluid storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, achieving temporally consistent and visually compelling video narratives without any additional training. Our approach bridges the gap between short clips and extended video to establish a new paradigm in GenAI-driven video synthesis from text.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Rethinking Video Tokenization: A Conditioned Diffusion-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03708v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video tokenizers typically use the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture for video compression and reconstruction. However, to achieve good performance, its training process often relies on complex multi-stage training tricks that go beyond basic reconstruction loss and KL regularization. Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise tuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate higher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel Conditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based decoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses spatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder reconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these latents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate videos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt sampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a basic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS perceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a single-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\times$ inference speedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent video generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The source code and pretrained weights will be released shortly, so please stay tuned for updates!</p></details> |  |
| **[The Best of Both Worlds: Integrating Language Models and Diffusion Models for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04606v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have been driven by two competing paradigms: autoregressive language models and diffusion models. However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a $\sim$14,000$\times$ compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Kling, and Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field.

| **[Self-Guidance: Boosting Flow and Diffusion Generation on Their Own](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05827v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proper guidance strategies are essential to achieve high-quality generation results without retraining diffusion and flow-based text-to-image models. Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, potentially limiting their applications. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which improves the image quality by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. SG only relies on the sampling probabilities of its own diffusion model at different noise levels with no need of any guidance-specific training. This makes it flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms, maximizing its potential to achieve competitive performances in many generative tasks. We conduct experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, Self-Guidance surpasses existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. Moreover, we find that SG has a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing its ability of eliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We will release our code along with this paper.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However, the generated videos often contain factual inaccuracies and lack understanding of fundamental physical laws. While some previous studies have highlighted this issue in limited domains through manual analysis, a comprehensive solution has not yet been established, primarily due to the absence of a generalized, automated approach for modeling and assessing the causal reasoning of these models across diverse scenarios. To address this gap, we propose VACT: an **automated** framework for modeling, evaluating, and measuring the causal understanding of VGMs in real-world scenarios. By combining causal analysis techniques with a carefully designed large language model assistant, our system can assess the causal behavior of models in various contexts without human annotation, which offers strong generalization and scalability. Additionally, we introduce multi-level causal evaluation metrics to provide a detailed analysis of the causal performance of VGMs. As a demonstration, we use our framework to benchmark several prevailing VGMs, offering insight into their causal reasoning capabilities. Our work lays the foundation for systematically addressing the causal understanding deficiencies in VGMs and contributes to advancing their reliability and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods have limitations: 3D diffusion models are limited by dataset scarcity and the absence of strong pre-trained priors, while 2D diffusion-based approaches struggle with geometric consistency. We propose a method that leverages 2D diffusion models' implicit 3D reasoning ability while ensuring 3D consistency via Gaussian-splatting-based geometric distillation. Specifically, the proposed Gaussian Splatting Decoder enforces 3D consistency by transforming SV3D latent outputs into an explicit 3D representation. Unlike SV3D, which only relies on implicit 2D representations for video generation, Gaussian Splatting explicitly encodes spatial and appearance attributes, enabling multi-view consistency through geometric constraints. These constraints correct view inconsistencies, ensuring robust geometric consistency. As a result, our approach simultaneously generates high-quality, multi-view-consistent images and accurate 3D models, providing a scalable solution for single-image-based 3D generation and bridging the gap between 2D Diffusion diversity and 3D structural coherence. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art multi-view consistency and strong generalization across diverse datasets. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

To achieve greater control over generated results, researchers introduce additional architectures, such as ControlNet, Adapters and ReferenceNet, to integrate conditioning controls. However, current controllable generation methods often require substantial additional computational resources, especially for video generation, and face challenges in training or exhibit weak control. In this paper, we propose ControlNeXt: a powerful and efficient method for controllable image and video generation. We first design a more straightforward and efficient architecture, replacing heavy additional branches with minimal additional cost compared to the base model. Such a concise structure also allows our method to seamlessly integrate with other LoRA weights, enabling style alteration without the need for additional training. As for training, we reduce up to 90% of learnable parameters compared to the alternatives. Furthermore, we propose another method called Cross Normalization (CN) as a replacement for Zero-Convolution' to achieve fast and stable training convergence.

Recent generative approaches, boosted by large-scale pre-trained video generation models, show promise in handling intricate scenes. However, they frequently produce unstable motion and content inconsistencies due to the absence of explicit motion trajectory constraints. To address these challenges, we propose Motion-aware Generative frame interpolation (MoG) that synergizes intermediate flow guidance with generative capacities to enhance interpolation fidelity. Our key insight is to simultaneously enforce motion smoothness through flow constraints while adaptively correcting flow estimation errors through generative refinement. Specifically, we first introduce a dual guidance injection that propagates condition information using intermediate flow at both latent and feature levels, aligning the generated motion with flow-derived motion trajectories. Meanwhile, we implemented two critical designs, encoder-only guidance injection and selective parameter fine-tuning, which enable dynamic artifact correction in the complex motion regions. Extensive experiments on both real-world and animation benchmarks demonstrate that MoG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of video quality and visual fidelity. Our work bridges the gap between flow-based stability and generative flexibility, offering a versatile solution for frame interpolation across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Generating such sequences with precise temporal control is infeasible with existing video generators that rely on a single paragraph of text as input. When tasked with generating multiple events described using a single prompt, such methods often ignore some of the events or fail to arrange them in the correct order. To address this limitation, we present MinT, a multi-event video generator with temporal control. Our key insight is to bind each event to a specific period in the generated video, which allows the model to focus on one event at a time. To enable time-aware interactions between event captions and video tokens, we design a time-based positional encoding method, dubbed ReRoPE. This encoding helps to guide the cross-attention operation. By fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion transformer on temporally grounded data, our approach produces coherent videos with smoothly connected events. For the first time in the literature, our model offers control over the timing of events in generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MinT outperforms existing commercial and open-source models by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Our approach tackles key challenges with three innovations: (1) 3D full-attention mechanisms with a sliding window denoising strategy, enabling infinite video generation with temporal coherence and visual quality across diverse character styles; (2) a two-stage curriculum learning scheme, integrating audio for lip sync, text for expressive dynamics, and reference images for identity preservation, enabling flexible multi-modal control over long sequences; and (3) region-specific masks with adaptive loss functions to balance global textual control and local audio guidance, supporting speaker-specific animations. Efficiency is enhanced via our innovative unified step and cfg distillation techniques, achieving a 20x inference speed boost over the basemodel: generating a 10 second 540x540p video in 10 seconds or 720x720p in 30 seconds on 8 H100 GPUs, without quality loss. Evaluations on our new benchmark demonstrate MagicInfinite's superiority in audio-lip synchronization, identity preservation, and motion naturalness across diverse scenarios.

However, the interplay between motion, structure, and identity representations in these models remains under-explored. Here, we investigate how self-attention query features (a.k.a. Q features) simultaneously govern motion, structure, and identity and examine the challenges arising when these representations interact. Our analysis reveals that Q affects not only layout, but that during denoising Q also has a strong effect on subject identity, making it hard to transfer motion without the side-effect of transferring identity. Understanding this dual role enabled us to control query feature injection (Q injection) and demonstrate two applications: (1) a zero-shot motion transfer method that is 20 times more efficient than existing approaches, and (2) a training-free technique for consistent multi-shot video generation, where characters maintain identity across multiple video shots while Q injection enhances motion fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>(1) P...</summary><p>(1) Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/MotionByQueries/ (2) The methods and results in section 5, "Consistent multi-shot video generation", are based on the arXiv version 1 (v1) of this work.

| **[Needle In A Video Haystack: A Scalable Synthetic Evaluator for Video MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09367v3)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding is a crucial next step for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Various benchmarks are introduced for better evaluating the MLLMs. Nevertheless, current video benchmarks are still inefficient for evaluating video models during iterative development due to the high cost of constructing datasets and the difficulty in isolating specific skills. In this paper, we propose VideoNIAH (Video Needle In A Haystack), a benchmark construction framework through synthetic video generation. VideoNIAH decouples video content from their query-responses by inserting unrelated visual 'needles' into original videos. The framework automates the generation of query-response pairs using predefined rules, minimizing manual labor. The queries focus on specific aspects of video understanding, enabling more skill-specific evaluations. The separation between video content and the queries also allow for increased video variety and evaluations across different lengths. Utilizing VideoNIAH, we compile a video benchmark VNBench, which includes tasks such as retrieval, ordering, and counting to evaluate three key aspects of video understanding: temporal perception, chronological ordering, and spatio-temporal coherence. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both proprietary and open-source models, uncovering significant differences in their video understanding capabilities across various tasks. Additionally, we perform an in-depth analysis of the test results and model configurations. Based on these findings, we provide some advice for improving video MLLM training, offering valuable insights to guide future research and model development.

However, challenges remain in accurately modeling driving scenes and generating long videos. To alleviate these issues, we propose DreamForge, an advanced diffusion-based autoregressive video generation model tailored for 3D-controllable long-term generation. To enhance the lane and foreground generation, we introduce perspective guidance and integrate object-wise position encoding to incorporate local 3D correlation and improve foreground object modeling. We also propose motion-aware temporal attention to capture motion cues and appearance changes in videos. By leveraging motion frames and an autoregressive generation paradigm,we can autoregressively generate long videos (over 200 frames) using a model trained in short sequences, achieving superior quality compared to the baseline in 16-frame video evaluations. Finally, we integrate our method with the realistic simulator DriveArena to provide more reliable open-loop and closed-loop evaluations for vision-based driving agents.

However, challenges remain in improving story attractiveness, enriching storytelling expressiveness, and developing open-source evaluation benchmarks and frameworks. Therefore, we propose and opensource MM-StoryAgent, which creates immersive narrated video storybooks with refined plots, role-consistent images, and multi-channel audio. MM-StoryAgent designs a multi-agent framework that employs LLMs and diverse expert tools (generative models and APIs) across several modalities to produce expressive storytelling videos. The framework enhances story attractiveness through a multi-stage writing pipeline. In addition, it improves the immersive storytelling experience by integrating sound effects with visual, music and narrative assets. MM-StoryAgent offers a flexible, open-source platform for further development, where generative modules can be substituted. Both objective and subjective evaluation regarding textual story quality and alignment between modalities validate the effectiveness of our proposed MM-StoryAgent system.

A key approach is training reward models to guide preference optimization. However, existing models are often task-specific, limiting their adaptability across diverse visual applications. We also argue that jointly learning to assess multiple tasks may foster a synergistic effect, where improved image understanding enhances image generation assessment, and refined image evaluation benefits video assessment through better frame analysis. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward, the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation assessment, enabling both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, which can be employed for vision model preference alignment. Specifically, (1) we first develop UnifiedReward on our constructed large-scale human preference dataset, including both image and video generation/understanding tasks. (2) Then, it is utilized to automatically construct high-quality preference pair data based on the vision models, fine-gradually filtering their outputs through pair ranking and point sifting. (3) Finally, these data are used for their preference alignment through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results demonstrate that joint learning to assess diverse visual tasks can lead to substantial mutual benefits and we apply our pipeline to both image and video understanding/generation tasks, significantly improving the performance in each domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/</p></details> |

To address these limitations, this paper presents a comprehensive approach that advances both data curation and model design. We introduce CFC-VIDS-1M, a high-quality video dataset constructed through a systematic coarse-to-fine curation pipeline. The pipeline first evaluates video quality across multiple dimensions, followed by a fine-grained stage that leverages vision-language models to enhance text-video alignment and semantic richness. Building upon the curated dataset's emphasis on visual quality and temporal coherence, we develop RACCOON, a transformer-based architecture with decoupled spatial-temporal attention mechanisms. The model is trained through a progressive four-stage strategy designed to efficiently handle the complexities of video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our integrated approach of high-quality data curation and efficient training strategy generates visually appealing and temporally coherent videos while maintaining computational efficiency. We will release our dataset, code, and models.</p></details> |  |

Current methods require multi-view videos for fluid reconstruction. We present FluidNexus, a novel framework that bridges video generation and physics simulation to tackle this task. Our key insight is to synthesize multiple novel-view videos as references for reconstruction. FluidNexus consists of two key components: (1) a novel-view video synthesizer that combines frame-wise view synthesis with video diffusion refinement for generating realistic videos, and (2) a physics-integrated particle representation coupling differentiable simulation and rendering to simultaneously facilitate 3D fluid reconstruction and prediction. To evaluate our approach, we collect two new real-world fluid datasets featuring textured backgrounds and object interactions.

A Closer Look at Controllable Human Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04666v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality benchmarks are crucial for driving progress in machine learning research. However, despite the growing interest in video generation, there is no comprehensive dataset to evaluate human generation. Humans can perform a wide variety of actions and interactions, but existing datasets, like TikTok and TED-Talks, lack the diversity and complexity to fully capture the capabilities of video generation models. We close this gap by introducing `What Are You Doing?' (WYD): a new benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of controllable image-to-video generation of humans. WYD consists of 1{,}544 captioned videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 56 fine-grained categories. These allow us to systematically measure performance across 9 aspects of human generation, including actions, interactions and motion. We also propose and validate automatic metrics that leverage our annotations and better capture human evaluations. Equipped with our dataset and metrics, we perform in-depth analyses of seven state-of-the-art models in controllable image-to-video generation, showing how WYD provides novel insights about the capabilities of these models. We release our data and code to drive forward progress in human video generation modeling at https://github.com/google-deepmind/wyd-benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Traditional latent diffusion pipelines rely on large Variational Autoencoder decoders that can slow down generation and consume considerable GPU memory. We propose custom-trained decoders using lightweight Vision Transformer and Taming Transformer architectures. Experiments show up to 15% overall speed-ups for image generation on COCO2017 and up to 20 times faster decoding in the sub-module, with additional gains on UCF-101 for video tasks. Memory requirements are moderately reduced, and while there is a small drop in perceptual quality compared to the default decoder, the improvements in speed and scalability are crucial for large-scale inference scenarios such as generating 100K images. Our work is further contextualized by advances in efficient video generation, including dual masking strategies, illustrating a broader effort to improve the scalability and efficiency of generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, generating long-duration, surround-view consistent driving videos remains a significant challenge. To address this, we present UniMLVG, a unified framework designed to generate extended street multi-perspective videos under precise control. By integrating single- and multi-view driving videos into the training data, our approach updates a DiT-based diffusion model equipped with cross-frame and cross-view modules across three stages with multi training objectives, substantially boosting the diversity and quality of generated visual content. Importantly, we propose an innovative explicit viewpoint modeling approach for multi-view video generation to effectively improve motion transition consistency. Capable of handling various input reference formats (e.g., text, images, or video), our UniMLVG generates high-quality multi-view videos according to the corresponding condition constraints such as 3D bounding boxes or frame-level text descriptions. Compared to the best models with similar capabilities, our framework achieves improvements of 48.2% in FID and 35.2% in FVD.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEN3C: 3D-Informed World-Consistent Video Generation with Precise Camera Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03751v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video.

| **[DualDiff+: Dual-Branch Diffusion for High-Fidelity Video Generation with Reward Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03689v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and high-fidelity driving scene reconstruction demands the effective utilization of comprehensive scene information as conditional inputs. Existing methods predominantly rely on 3D bounding boxes and BEV road maps for foreground and background control, which fail to capture the full complexity of driving scenes and adequately integrate multimodal information. In this work, we present DualDiff, a dual-branch conditional diffusion model designed to enhance driving scene generation across multiple views and video sequences. Specifically, we introduce Occupancy Ray-shape Sampling (ORS) as a conditional input, offering rich foreground and background semantics alongside 3D spatial geometry to precisely control the generation of both elements. To improve the synthesis of fine-grained foreground objects, particularly complex and distant ones, we propose a Foreground-Aware Mask (FGM) denoising loss function. Additionally, we develop the Semantic Fusion Attention (SFA) mechanism to dynamically prioritize relevant information and suppress noise, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Finally, to ensure high-quality image-to-video generation, we introduce the Reward-Guided Diffusion (RGD) framework, which maintains global consistency and semantic coherence in generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualDiff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets. On the NuScenes dataset, DualDiff reduces the FID score by 4.09% compared to the best baseline. In downstream tasks, such as BEV segmentation, our method improves vehicle mIoU by 4.50% and road mIoU by 1.70%, while in BEV 3D object detection, the foreground mAP increases by 1.46%.

Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a surgical light, hoping some cameras will observe the surgical field with less occlusion. However, this special camera setup poses a new imaging challenge since camera configurations can change every time surgeons move the light, and manual image alignment is required. This paper proposes an algorithm to automate this alignment task. The proposed method detects frames where the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion. This algorithm results in a stabilized video with less occlusion. Quantitative results show that our method outperforms conventional approaches. A user study involving medical doctors also confirmed the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI2023</p></details> |

We develop VideoWorld, an auto-regressive video generation model trained on unlabeled video data, and test its knowledge acquisition abilities in video-based Go and robotic control tasks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) video-only training provides sufficient information for learning knowledge, including rules, reasoning and planning capabilities, and (2) the representation of visual change is crucial for knowledge acquisition. To improve both the efficiency and efficacy of this process, we introduce the Latent Dynamics Model (LDM) as a key component of VideoWorld. Remarkably, VideoWorld reaches a 5-dan professional level in the Video-GoBench with just a 300-million-parameter model, without relying on search algorithms or reward mechanisms typical in reinforcement learning. In robotic tasks, VideoWorld effectively learns diverse control operations and generalizes across environments, approaching the performance of oracle models in CALVIN and RLBench. This study opens new avenues for knowledge acquisition from visual data, with all code, data, and models open-sourced for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are released at: https://maverickren.github.io/VideoWorld.github.io/</p></details> |

We introduce a benchmark designed specifically to assess the Physical Coherence of generated videos, PhyCoBench. Our benchmark includes 120 prompts covering 7 categories of physical principles, capturing key physical laws observable in video content. We evaluated four state-of-the-art (SoTA) T2V models on PhyCoBench and conducted manual assessments. Additionally, we propose an automated evaluation model: PhyCoPredictor, a diffusion model that generates optical flow and video frames in a cascade manner. Through a consistency evaluation comparing automated and manual sorting, the experimental results show that PhyCoPredictor currently aligns most closely with human evaluation. Therefore, it can effectively evaluate the physical coherence of videos, providing insights for future model optimization. Our benchmark, including physical coherence prompts, the automatic evaluation tool PhyCoPredictor, and the generated video dataset, has been released on GitHub at https://github.com/Jeckinchen/PhyCoBench.</p></details> |  |

The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Due to limited computational resources and training data, our experiments provide empirical evidence of the algorithm's strong super-resolution capabilities using synthetic data.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose MagicDrive-V2, a novel approach that integrates the MVDiT block and spatial-temporal conditional encoding to enable multi-view video generation and precise geometric control. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method for obtaining contextual descriptions for videos to support diverse textual control, along with a progressive training strategy using mixed video data to enhance training efficiency and generalizability. Consequently, MagicDrive-V2 enables multi-view driving video synthesis with $3.3\times$ resolution and $4\times$ frame count (compared to current SOTA), rich contextual control, and geometric controls.

As an effective solution, flow matching aims to reflow the diffusion process of diffusion models into a straight line for a few-step and even one-step generation. However, in this paper, we suggest that the original training pipeline of flow matching is not optimal and introduce two techniques to improve it. Firstly, we introduce progressive reflow, which progressively reflows the diffusion models in local timesteps until the whole diffusion progresses, reducing the difficulty of flow matching. Second, we introduce aligned v-prediction, which highlights the importance of direction matching in flow matching over magnitude matching. Experimental results on SDv1.5 and SDXL demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, for example, conducting on SDv1.5 achieves an FID of 10.70 on MSCOCO2014 validation set with only 4 sampling steps, close to our teacher model (32 DDIM steps, FID = 10.05).</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our codes will be released at Github</p></details> |
| **[Unified Video Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00200v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified video and action model holds significant promise for robotics, where videos provide rich scene information for action prediction, and actions provide dynamics information for video prediction. However, effectively combining video generation and action prediction remains challenging, and current video generation-based methods struggle to match the performance of direct policy learning in action accuracy and inference speed. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified Video Action model (UVA), which jointly optimizes video and action predictions to achieve both high accuracy and efficient action inference. The key lies in learning a joint video-action latent representation and decoupling video-action decoding. The joint latent representation bridges the visual and action domains, effectively modeling the relationship between video and action sequences. Meanwhile, the decoupled decoding, powered by two lightweight diffusion heads, enables high-speed action inference by bypassing video generation during inference. Such a unified framework further enables versatile functionality through masked input training. By selectively masking actions or videos, a single model can tackle diverse tasks beyond policy learning, such as forward and inverse dynamics modeling and video generation. Via an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that UVA can serve as a general-purpose solution for a wide range of robotics tasks, such as policy learning, forward/inverse dynamics and video observation prediction, without compromising performance compared to methods tailored for specific applications.

However, emerging and unfamiliar studies face limitations, including safety concerns and iterative efficiency. To address these challenges, this study utilises a Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to create GenAI-generated scenarios for user experience (UX). By recruiting real users to evaluate this experience, we can collect feedback that enables rapid iteration in the early design phase. The air taxi is particularly representative of these challenges and has been chosen as the case study for this research. The key contribution was designing an Air Taxi Journey (ATJ) using Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI image and video generators.

Furthermore, the LLMs demonstrated the ability to identify and suggest environments that significantly improve participants' willingness toward air taxis. Education level and gender significantly influenced participants' the difference in willingness and their satisfaction with the ATJ. Satisfaction with the ATJ serves as a mediator, significantly influencing participants' willingness to take air taxis.

However, their real-world performance often falls short of user expectations. One key reason is that these models have not been trained on videos related to some topics users want to create. In this paper, we propose VideoUFO, the first Video dataset specifically curated to align with Users' FOcus in real-world scenarios. Beyond this, our VideoUFO also features: (1) minimal ($0.29\%$) overlap with existing video datasets, and (2) videos searched exclusively via YouTube's official API under the Creative Commons license. These two attributes provide future researchers with greater freedom to broaden their training sources. The VideoUFO comprises over $1.09$ million video clips, each paired with both a brief and a detailed caption (description). Specifically, through clustering, we first identify $1,291$ user-focused topics from the million-scale real text-to-video prompt dataset, VidProM. Then, we use these topics to retrieve videos from YouTube, split the retrieved videos into clips, and generate both brief and detailed captions for each clip. After verifying the clips with specified topics, we are left with about $1.09$ million video clips. Our experiments reveal that (1) current $16$ text-to-video models do not achieve consistent performance across all user-focused topics; and (2) a simple model trained on VideoUFO outperforms others on worst-performing topics.

Nonetheless, the potential of VDMs for creating transparent videos remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we introduce TransVDM, the first diffusion-based model specifically designed for transparent video generation. TransVDM integrates a Transparent Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) and a pretrained UNet-based VDM, along with a novel Alpha Motion Constraint Module (AMCM). The TVAE captures the alpha channel transparency of video frames and encodes it into the latent space of the VDMs, facilitating a seamless transition to transparent video diffusion models. To improve the detection of transparent areas, the AMCM integrates motion constraints from the foreground within the VDM, helping to reduce undesirable artifacts. Moreover, we curate a dataset containing 250K transparent frames for training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Offline Model-Based RL via Jointly-Optimized World-Action Model Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00564v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant aspiration of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop a generalist agent with high capabilities from large and heterogeneous datasets. However, prior approaches that scale offline RL either rely heavily on expert trajectories or struggle to generalize to diverse unseen tasks. Inspired by the excellent generalization of world model in conditional video generation, we explore the potential of image observation-based world model for scaling offline RL and enhancing generalization on novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce JOWA: Jointly-Optimized World-Action model, an offline model-based RL agent pretrained on multiple Atari games with 6 billion tokens data to learn general-purpose representation and decision-making ability. Our method jointly optimizes a world-action model through a shared transformer backbone, which stabilize temporal difference learning with large models during pretraining. Moreover, we propose a provably efficient and parallelizable planning algorithm to compensate for the Q-value estimation error and thus search out better policies. Experimental results indicate that our largest agent, with 150 million parameters, achieves 78.9% human-level performance on pretrained games using only 10% subsampled offline data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art large-scale offline RL baselines by 31.6% on averange. Furthermore, JOWA scales favorably with model capacity and can sample-efficiently transfer to novel games using only 5k offline fine-tuning data (approximately 4 trajectories) per game, demonstrating superior generalization. We will release codes and model weights at https://github.com/CJReinforce/JOWA</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Recent methods have shown promising composition editing results in the image setting, but in the video setting, editing methods have focused on editing object's appearance and motion, or camera motion, and as a result, methods to edit object composition in videos are still missing. We propose \name as a method for editing 3D object compositions in videos of static scenes with camera motion. Our approach allows editing the 3D position of a 3D object across all frames of a video in a temporally consistent manner. This is achieved by lifting intermediate features of a generative model to a 3D reconstruction that is shared between all frames, editing the reconstruction, and projecting the features on the edited reconstruction back to each frame. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative approach to edit object compositions in videos. Our approach is simple and training-free, while outperforming state-of-the-art image editing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://videohandles.github.io</p></details> |

The key challenge of this task lies in simultaneously generating natural motions while preserving the original appearance of the images. However, current I2V diffusion models (I2V-DMs) often produce videos with limited motion degrees or exhibit uncontrollable motion that conflicts with the textual condition. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Extrapolating and Decoupling framework, which introduces model merging techniques to the I2V domain for the first time. Specifically, our framework consists of three separate stages: (1) Starting with a base I2V-DM, we explicitly inject the textual condition into the temporal module using a lightweight, learnable adapter and fine-tune the integrated model to improve motion controllability. (2) We introduce a training-free extrapolation strategy to amplify the dynamic range of the motion, effectively reversing the fine-tuning process to enhance the motion degree significantly. (3) With the above two-stage models excelling in motion controllability and degree, we decouple the relevant parameters associated with each type of motion ability and inject them into the base I2V-DM. Since the I2V-DM handles different levels of motion controllability and dynamics at various denoising time steps, we adjust the motion-aware parameters accordingly over time. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

To address this oversight, we introduce Q-Bench-Video in this paper, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LMMs' proficiency in discerning video quality. a) To ensure video source diversity, Q-Bench-Video encompasses videos from natural scenes, AI-generated Content (AIGC), and Computer Graphics (CG). b) Building on the traditional multiple-choice questions format with the Yes-or-No and What-How categories, we include Open-ended questions to better evaluate complex scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate the video pair quality comparison question to enhance comprehensiveness. c) Beyond the traditional Technical, Aesthetic, and Temporal distortions, we have expanded our evaluation aspects to include the dimension of AIGC distortions, which addresses the increasing demand for video generation. Finally, we collect a total of 2,378 question-answer pairs and test them on 12 open-source & 5 proprietary LMMs. Our findings indicate that while LMMs have a foundational understanding of video quality, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise, with a notable discrepancy compared to human performance. Through Q-Bench-Video, we seek to catalyze community interest, stimulate further research, and unlock the untapped potential of LMMs to close the gap in video quality understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Video Generation without Vector Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14169v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach that enables autoregressive video generation with high efficiency. We propose to reformulate the video generation problem as a non-quantized autoregressive modeling of temporal frame-by-frame prediction and spatial set-by-set prediction. Unlike raster-scan prediction in prior autoregressive models or joint distribution modeling of fixed-length tokens in diffusion models, our approach maintains the causal property of GPT-style models for flexible in-context capabilities, while leveraging bidirectional modeling within individual frames for efficiency. With the proposed approach, we train a novel video autoregressive model without vector quantization, termed NOVA. Our results demonstrate that NOVA surpasses prior autoregressive video models in data efficiency, inference speed, visual fidelity, and video fluency, even with a much smaller model capacity, i.e., 0.6B parameters. NOVA also outperforms state-of-the-art image diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks, with a significantly lower training cost. Additionally, NOVA generalizes well across extended video durations and enables diverse zero-shot applications in one unified model.

However, current image-to-video diffusion models, while powerful in generating videos from a single conditioning frame, need adaptation for two-frame (start & end) conditioned generation, which is essential for effective bounded interpolation. Unfortunately, existing approaches that fuse temporally forward and backward paths in parallel often suffer from off-manifold issues, leading to artifacts or requiring multiple iterative re-noising steps. In this work, we introduce a novel, bidirectional sampling strategy to address these off-manifold issues without requiring extensive re-noising or fine-tuning. Our method employs sequential sampling along both forward and backward paths, conditioned on the start and end frames, respectively, ensuring more coherent and on-manifold generation of intermediate frames. Additionally, we incorporate advanced guidance techniques, CFG++ and DDS, to further enhance the interpolation process. By integrating these, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently generating high-quality, smooth videos between keyframes. On a single 3090 GPU, our method can interpolate 25 frames at 1024 x 576 resolution in just 195 seconds, establishing it as a leading solution for keyframe interpolation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; Project page: https://vibidsampler.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Training-free and Adaptive Sparse Attention for Efficient Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21079v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-fidelity long videos with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is often hindered by significant latency, primarily due to the computational demands of attention mechanisms. For instance, generating an 8-second 720p video (110K tokens) with HunyuanVideo takes about 600 PFLOPs, with around 500 PFLOPs consumed by attention computations. To address this issue, we propose AdaSpa, the first Dynamic Pattern and Online Precise Search sparse attention method. Firstly, to realize the Dynamic Pattern, we introduce a blockified pattern to efficiently capture the hierarchical sparsity inherent in DiTs. This is based on our observation that sparse characteristics of DiTs exhibit hierarchical and blockified structures between and within different modalities. This blockified approach significantly reduces the complexity of attention computation while maintaining high fidelity in the generated videos. Secondly, to enable Online Precise Search, we propose the Fused LSE-Cached Search with Head-adaptive Hierarchical Block Sparse Attention. This method is motivated by our finding that DiTs' sparse pattern and LSE vary w.r.t. inputs, layers, and heads, but remain invariant across denoising steps. By leveraging this invariance across denoising steps, it adapts to the dynamic nature of DiTs and allows for precise, real-time identification of sparse indices with minimal overhead. AdaSpa is implemented as an adaptive, plug-and-play solution and can be integrated seamlessly with existing DiTs, requiring neither additional fine-tuning nor a dataset-dependent profiling. Extensive experiments validate that AdaSpa delivers substantial acceleration across various models while preserving video quality, establishing itself as a robust and scalable approach to efficient video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[InterDyn: Controllable Interactive Dynamics with Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11785v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the dynamics of interacting objects is essential for both humans and intelligent systems. However, existing approaches are limited to simplified, toy settings and lack generalizability to complex, real-world environments. Recent advances in generative models have enabled the prediction of state transitions based on interventions, but focus on generating a single future state which neglects the continuous dynamics resulting from the interaction. To address this gap, we propose InterDyn, a novel framework that generates videos of interactive dynamics given an initial frame and a control signal encoding the motion of a driving object or actor. Our key insight is that large video generation models can act as both neural renderers and implicit physics simulators, having learned interactive dynamics from large-scale video data. To effectively harness this capability, we introduce an interactive control mechanism that conditions the video generation process on the motion of the driving entity. Qualitative results demonstrate that InterDyn generates plausible, temporally consistent videos of complex object interactions while generalizing to unseen objects. Quantitative evaluations show that InterDyn outperforms baselines that focus on static state transitions. This work highlights the potential of leveraging video generative models as implicit physics engines. Code and trained models will be released at: https://interdyn.is.tue.mpg.de/</p></details> |  |

However, their performance on videos involving human actions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to accumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second, videos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human attributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions and interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely HAICTrain and HAICBench. \textbf{HAICTrain} comprises 126K video-caption pairs generated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes. Meanwhile, \textbf{HAICBench} includes 500 manually annotated video-caption pairs and 1,400 QA pairs, for a comprehensive evaluation of human action understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that training with HAICTrain not only significantly enhances human understanding abilities across 4 benchmarks, but can also improve text-to-video generation results. Both the HAICTrain and HAICBench are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/KuaishouHAIC/HAIC.</p></details> |  |

Among these technologies, camera control is crucial for generating professional-quality videos that accurately meet user expectations. However, existing camera control methods still suffer from several limitations, including control precision and the neglect of the control for subject motion dynamics. In this work, we propose I2VControl-Camera, a novel camera control method that significantly enhances controllability while providing adjustability over the strength of subject motion. To improve control precision, we employ point trajectory in the camera coordinate system instead of only extrinsic matrix information as our control signal. To accurately control and adjust the strength of subject motion, we explicitly model the higher-order components of the video trajectory expansion, not merely the linear terms, and design an operator that effectively represents the motion strength. We use an adapter architecture that is independent of the base model structure. Experiments on static and dynamic scenes show that our framework outperformances previous methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

High content and motion fidelity aligned with text prompts, however, often require large model parameters and a substantial number of function evaluations (NFEs). Realistic and visually appealing details are typically reflected in high resolution outputs, further amplifying computational demands especially for single stage DiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two stage framework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs across stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage, prompt fidelity is prioritized through a low resolution generation process utilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational efficiency. The second stage establishes flow matching between low and high resolutions, effectively generating fine details with minimal NFEs. Quantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves state-of-the-art high resolution video generation with superior computational efficiency. Additionally, the two-stage design enables users to preview the initial output and accordingly adjust the prompt before committing to full-resolution generation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs and wait times as well as enhancing commercial viability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Model...</summary><p>Model and Weight: https://github.com/FoundationVision/FlashVideo</p></details> |

However, existing controlled diffusion transformer methods incur significant parameter and computational overheads and suffer from inefficient resource allocation due to their failure to account for the varying relevance of control information across different transformer layers. To address this, we propose the Relevance-Guided Efficient Controllable Generation framework, RelaCtrl, enabling efficient and resource-optimized integration of control signals into the Diffusion Transformer. First, we evaluate the relevance of each layer in the Diffusion Transformer to the control information by assessing the "ControlNet Relevance Score"-i.e., the impact of skipping each control layer on both the quality of generation and the control effectiveness during inference. Based on the strength of the relevance, we then tailor the positioning, parameter scale, and modeling capacity of the control layers to reduce unnecessary parameters and redundant computations. Additionally, to further improve efficiency, we replace the self-attention and FFN in the commonly used copy block with the carefully designed Two-Dimensional Shuffle Mixer (TDSM), enabling efficient implementation of both the token mixer and channel mixer. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance with only 15% of the parameters and computational complexity compared to PixArt-delta.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://360cvgroup.github.io/RelaCtrl/ Github: https://github.com/360CVGroup/RelaCtrl</p></details> |

However, current benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate these claims, focusing only on general video quality, ignoring important factors to world models such as physics adherence. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldModelBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the world modeling capabilities of video generation models in application-driven domains. WorldModelBench offers two key advantages: (1) Against to nuanced world modeling violations: By incorporating instruction-following and physics-adherence dimensions, WorldModelBench detects subtle violations, such as irregular changes in object size that breach the mass conservation law - issues overlooked by prior benchmarks. (2) Aligned with large-scale human preferences: We crowd-source 67K human labels to accurately measure 14 frontier models. Using our high-quality human labels, we further fine-tune an accurate judger to automate the evaluation procedure, achieving 8.6% higher average accuracy in predicting world modeling violations than GPT-4o with 2B parameters. In addition, we demonstrate that training to align human annotations by maximizing the rewards from the judger noticeably improve the world modeling capability.

Specifically, given a monocular reference video, SV4D generates novel views for each video frame that are temporally consistent. We then use the generated novel view videos to optimize an implicit 4D representation (dynamic NeRF) efficiently, without the need for cumbersome SDS-based optimization used in most prior works. To train our unified novel view video generation model, we curate a dynamic 3D object dataset from the existing Objaverse dataset.

Our method repurposes the pre-trained video latent diffusion model for generating looping videos from text prompts without any training. During inference, we first construct a latent cycle by connecting the starting and ending noise of the videos. Given that the temporal consistency can be maintained by the context of the video diffusion model, we perform multi-frame latent denoising by gradually shifting the first-frame latent to the end in each step. As a result, the denoising context varies in each step while maintaining consistency throughout the inference process. Moreover, the latent cycle in our method can be of any length. This extends our latent-shifting approach to generate seamless looping videos beyond the scope of the video diffusion model's context. Unlike previous cinemagraphs, the proposed method does not require an image as appearance, which will restrict the motions of the generated results. Instead, our method can produce more dynamic motion and better visual quality. We conduct multiple experiments and comparisons to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its efficacy in different scenarios. All the code will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mobius-diffusion.github.io/ ; GitHub repository: https://github.com/YisuiTT/Mobius</p></details> |
| **[Do generative video models understand physical principles?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09038v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI video generation is undergoing a revolution, with quality and realism advancing rapidly. These advances have led to a passionate scientific debate: Do video models learn "world models" that discover laws of physics -- or, alternatively, are they merely sophisticated pixel predictors that achieve visual realism without understanding the physical principles of reality? We address this question by developing Physics-IQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that can only be solved by acquiring a deep understanding of various physical principles, like fluid dynamics, optics, solid mechanics, magnetism and thermodynamics. We find that across a range of current models (Sora, Runway, Pika, Lumiere, Stable Video Diffusion, and VideoPoet), physical understanding is severely limited, and unrelated to visual realism. At the same time, some test cases can already be successfully solved. This indicates that acquiring certain physical principles from observation alone may be possible, but significant challenges remain. While we expect rapid advances ahead, our work demonstrates that visual realism does not imply physical understanding.

In this work, we revisit the conventional static paradigm that allocates a fixed compute budget per denoising iteration and propose a dynamic strategy instead. Our simple and sample-efficient framework enables pre-trained DiT models to be converted into \emph{flexible} ones -- dubbed FlexiDiT -- allowing them to process inputs at varying compute budgets. We demonstrate how a single \emph{flexible} model can generate images without any drop in quality, while reducing the required FLOPs by more than $40$\% compared to their static counterparts, for both class-conditioned and text-conditioned image generation. Our method is general and agnostic to input and conditioning modalities. We show how our approach can be readily extended for video generation, where FlexiDiT models generate samples with up to $75$\% less compute without compromising performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[C-Drag: Chain-of-Thought Driven Motion Controller for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19868v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory-based motion control has emerged as an intuitive and efficient approach for controllable video generation. However, the existing trajectory-based approaches are usually limited to only generating the motion trajectory of the controlled object and ignoring the dynamic interactions between the controlled object and its surroundings. To address this limitation, we propose a Chain-of-Thought-based motion controller for controllable video generation, named C-Drag. Instead of directly generating the motion of some objects, our C-Drag first performs object perception and then reasons the dynamic interactions between different objects according to the given motion control of the objects. Specifically, our method includes an object perception module and a Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module. The object perception module employs visual language models to capture the position and category information of various objects within the image. The Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module takes this information as input and conducts a stage-wise reasoning process to generate motion trajectories for each of the affected objects, which are subsequently fed to the diffusion model for video synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a new video object interaction (VOI) dataset to evaluate the generation quality of motion controlled video generation methods. Our VOI dataset contains three typical types of interactions and provides the motion trajectories of objects that can be used for accurate performance evaluation. Experimental results show that C-Drag achieves promising performance across multiple metrics, excelling in object motion control. Our benchmark, codes, and models will be available at https://github.com/WesLee88524/C-Drag-Official-Repo.</p></details> |  |

Despite their substantial potential, the generated videos may present artifacts, including structural implausibility, temporal inconsistency, and a lack of motion, often resulting in near-static video. In this work, we have identified a correlation between the disparity of temporal attention maps across different blocks and the occurrence of temporal inconsistencies. Additionally, we have observed that the energy contained within the temporal attention maps is directly related to the magnitude of motion amplitude in the generated videos. Based on these observations, we present ByTheWay, a training-free method to improve the quality of text-to-video generation without introducing additional parameters, augmenting memory or sampling time. Specifically, ByTheWay is composed of two principal components: 1) Temporal Self-Guidance improves the structural plausibility and temporal consistency of generated videos by reducing the disparity between the temporal attention maps across various decoder blocks. 2) Fourier-based Motion Enhancement enhances the magnitude and richness of motion by amplifying the energy of the map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ByTheWay significantly improves the quality of text-to-video generation with negligible additional cost.</p></details> |  |

Our method is founded on the observation that attention difference in the diffusion process exhibits a U-shaped pattern, indicating significant redundancy. We mitigate this by broadcasting attention outputs to subsequent steps in a pyramid style. It applies different broadcast strategies to each attention based on their variance for best efficiency. We further introduce broadcast sequence parallel for more efficient distributed inference. PAB demonstrates up to 10.5x speedup across three models compared to baselines, achieving real-time generation for up to 720p videos. We anticipate that our simple yet effective method will serve as a robust baseline and facilitate future research and application for video generation.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[EchoVideo: Identity-Preserving Human Video Generation by Multimodal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13452v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have significantly impacted various downstream applications, particularly in identity-preserving video generation (IPT2V). However, existing methods struggle with "copy-paste" artifacts and low similarity issues, primarily due to their reliance on low-level facial image information. This dependence can result in rigid facial appearances and artifacts reflecting irrelevant details. To address these challenges, we propose EchoVideo, which employs two key strategies: (1) an Identity Image-Text Fusion Module (IITF) that integrates high-level semantic features from text, capturing clean facial identity representations while discarding occlusions, poses, and lighting variations to avoid the introduction of artifacts; (2) a two-stage training strategy, incorporating a stochastic method in the second phase to randomly utilize shallow facial information. The objective is to balance the enhancements in fidelity provided by shallow features while mitigating excessive reliance on them. This strategy encourages the model to utilize high-level features during training, ultimately fostering a more robust representation of facial identities.

However, 3D shape generation technology has so far lagged behind, constrained by limitations in 3D data scale, complexity of 3D data processing, and insufficient exploration of advanced techniques in the 3D domain. Current approaches to 3D shape generation face substantial challenges in terms of output quality, generalization capability, and alignment with input conditions. We present TripoSG, a new streamlined shape diffusion paradigm capable of generating high-fidelity 3D meshes with precise correspondence to input images. Specifically, we propose: 1) A large-scale rectified flow transformer for 3D shape generation, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity through training on extensive, high-quality data. 2) A hybrid supervised training strategy combining SDF, normal, and eikonal losses for 3D VAE, achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction performance. 3) A data processing pipeline to generate 2 million high-quality 3D samples, highlighting the crucial rules for data quality and quantity in training 3D generative models. Through comprehensive experiments, we have validated the effectiveness of each component in our new framework. The seamless integration of these parts has enabled TripoSG to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape generation. The resulting 3D shapes exhibit enhanced detail due to high-resolution capabilities and demonstrate exceptional fidelity to input images. Moreover, TripoSG demonstrates improved versatility in generating 3D models from diverse image styles and contents, showcasing strong generalization capabilities. To foster progress and innovation in the field of 3D generation, we will make our model publicly available.</p></details> |  |

As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of O(N^2), compared to O(N) for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs almost no end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

However, existing methods suffer from poor controllability, making them less applicable to real-world scenarios such as filmmaking and live streaming for e-commerce. To address this limitation, we propose FLAP, a novel approach that integrates explicit 3D intermediate parameters (head poses and facial expressions) into the diffusion model for end-to-end generation of realistic portrait videos. The proposed architecture allows the model to generate vivid portrait videos from audio while simultaneously incorporating additional control signals, such as head rotation angles and eye-blinking frequency. Furthermore, the decoupling of head pose and facial expression allows for independent control of each, offering precise manipulation of both the avatar's pose and facial expressions. We also demonstrate its flexibility in integrating with existing 3D head generation methods, bridging the gap between 3D model-based approaches and end-to-end diffusion techniques. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms recent audio-driven portrait video models in both naturalness and controllability.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Recently, researchers have explored employing neural radiance fields or diffusion models to generate novel views or synthetic data under driving scenes. However, these approaches suffer from unseen scenes or restricted video length, thus lacking sufficient adaptability for data generation and simulation. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective framework, named Glad, to generate video data in a frame-by-frame style. To ensure the temporal consistency of synthetic video, we introduce a latent variable propagation module, which views the latent features of previous frame as noise prior and injects it into the latent features of current frame. In addition, we design a streaming data sampler to orderly sample the original image in a video clip at continuous iterations. Given the reference frame, our Glad can be viewed as a streaming simulator by generating the videos for specific scenes. Extensive experiments are performed on the widely-used nuScenes dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Glad achieves promising performance, serving as a strong baseline for online video generation. We will release the source code and models publicly.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |

To accelerate this process, we developed a low-precision, mathematically-equivalent algorithm called PASA, based on Flash Attention. PASA introduces two novel techniques: online pseudo-average shifting and global recovering. These techniques enable the use of half-precision computation throughout the Flash Attention process without incurring overflow instability or unacceptable numerical accuracy loss. This algorithm enhances performance on memory-restricted AI hardware architectures, such as the Ascend Neural-network Processing Unit(NPU), by reducing data movement and increasing computational FLOPs. The algorithm is validated using both designed random benchmarks and real large models. We find that the large bias and amplitude of attention input data are critical factors contributing to numerical overflow ($>65504$ for half precision) in two different categories of large models (Qwen2-7B language models and Stable-Video-Diffusion multi-modal models). Specifically, overflow arises due to the large bias in the sequence dimension and the resonance mechanism between the query and key in the head dimension of the Stable-Video-Diffusion models. The resonance mechanism is defined as phase coincidence or 180-degree phase shift between query and key matrices. It will remarkably amplify the element values of attention score matrix. This issue also applies to the Qwen models. Additionally, numerical accuracy is assessed through root mean square error (RMSE) and by comparing the final generated texts and videos to those produced using high-precision attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 Pa...</summary><p>21 Pages, 14 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

| **[Minimax Optimality of the Probability Flow ODE for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09583v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models have become a foundational paradigm for modern generative modeling, demonstrating exceptional capability in generating samples from complex high-dimensional distributions. Despite the dominant adoption of probability flow ODE-based samplers in practice due to their superior sampling efficiency and precision, rigorous statistical guarantees for these methods have remained elusive in the literature. This work develops the first end-to-end theoretical framework for deterministic ODE-based samplers that establishes near-minimax optimal guarantees under mild assumptions on target data distributions. Specifically, focusing on subgaussian distributions with $\beta$-H\"older smooth densities for $\beta\leq 2$, we propose a smooth regularized score estimator that simultaneously controls both the $L^2$ score error and the associated mean Jacobian error. Leveraging this estimator within a refined convergence analysis of the ODE-based sampling process, we demonstrate that the resulting sampler achieves the minimax rate in total variation distance, modulo logarithmic factors. Notably, our theory comprehensively accounts for all sources of error in the sampling process and does not require strong structural conditions such as density lower bounds or Lipschitz/smooth scores on target distributions, thereby covering a broad range of practical data distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block Diffusion: Interpolating Between Autoregressive and Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09573v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences.

To mitigate this challenge, we note that the reverse process of diffusion exhibits an inherent entropy-reducing nature. Given the inter-frame redundancy in video modality, maintaining full frame rates in high-entropy stages is unnecessary. Based on this insight, we propose TPDiff, a unified framework to enhance training and inference efficiency. By dividing diffusion into several stages, our framework progressively increases frame rate along the diffusion process with only the last stage operating on full frame rate, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. To train the multi-stage diffusion model, we introduce a dedicated training framework: stage-wise diffusion. By solving the partitioned probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODE) of diffusion under aligned data and noise, our training strategy is applicable to various diffusion forms and further enhances training efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate the generality of our method, demonstrating 50% reduction in training cost and 1.5x improvement in inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://showlab.github.io/TPDiff/</p></details> |
| **[FCaS: Fine-grained Cardiac Image Synthesis based on 3D Template Conditional Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09560v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving medical imaging data scarcity through semantic image generation has attracted significant attention in recent years. However, existing methods primarily focus on generating whole-organ or large-tissue structures, showing limited effectiveness for organs with fine-grained structure. Due to stringent topological consistency, fragile coronary features, and complex 3D morphological heterogeneity in cardiac imaging, accurately reconstructing fine-grained anatomical details of the heart remains a great challenge. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose the Fine-grained Cardiac image Synthesis(FCaS) framework, established on 3D template conditional diffusion model. FCaS achieves precise cardiac structure generation using Template-guided Conditional Diffusion Model (TCDM) through bidirectional mechanisms, which provides the fine-grained topological structure information of target image through the guidance of template. Meanwhile, we design a deformable Mask Generation Module (MGM) to mitigate the scarcity of high-quality and diverse reference mask in the generation process. Furthermore, to alleviate the confusion caused by imprecise synthetic images, we propose a Confidence-aware Adaptive Learning (CAL) strategy to facilitate the pre-training of downstream segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce the Skip-Sampling Variance (SSV) estimation to obtain confidence maps, which are subsequently employed to rectify the pre-training on downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that images generated from FCaS achieves state-of-the-art performance in topological consistency and visual quality, which significantly facilitates the downstream tasks as well. Code will be released in the future.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[CM-Diff: A Single Generative Network for Bidirectional Cross-Modality Translation Diffusion Model Between Infrared and Visible Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09514v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The image translation method represents a crucial approach for mitigating information deficiencies in the infrared and visible modalities, while also facilitating the enhancement of modality-specific datasets. However, existing methods for infrared and visible image translation either achieve unidirectional modality translation or rely on cycle consistency for bidirectional modality translation, which may result in suboptimal performance. In this work, we present the cross-modality translation diffusion model (CM-Diff) for simultaneously modeling data distributions in both the infrared and visible modalities. We address this challenge by combining translation direction labels for guidance during training with cross-modality feature control. Specifically, we view the establishment of the mapping relationship between the two modalities as the process of learning data distributions and understanding modality differences, achieved through a novel Bidirectional Diffusion Training (BDT) strategy. Additionally, we propose a Statistical Constraint Inference (SCI) strategy to ensure the generated image closely adheres to the data distribution of the target modality. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our CM-Diff over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential for generating dual-modality datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAMM-Diffusion: Learning Divergence-Aware Multi-Modal Diffusion Model for Nanoparticles Distribution Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09491v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of nanoparticles (NPs) distribution is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. Recent studies indicate that the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME) highly affects the distribution of NPs across tumors. Hence, it has become a research hotspot to generate the NPs distribution by the aid of multi-modal TME components. However, the distribution divergence among multi-modal TME components may cause side effects i.e., the best uni-modal model may outperform the joint generative model. To address the above issues, we propose a \textbf{D}ivergence-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Diffusion} model (i.e., \textbf{DAMM-Diffusion}) to adaptively generate the prediction results from uni-modal and multi-modal branches in a unified network. In detail, the uni-modal branch is composed of the U-Net architecture while the multi-modal branch extends it by introducing two novel fusion modules i.e., Multi-Modal Fusion Module (MMFM) and Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Module (UAFM). Specifically, the MMFM is proposed to fuse features from multiple modalities, while the UAFM module is introduced to learn the uncertainty map for cross-attention computation. Following the individual prediction results from each branch, the Divergence-Aware Multi-Modal Predictor (DAMMP) module is proposed to assess the consistency of multi-modal data with the uncertainty map, which determines whether the final prediction results come from multi-modal or uni-modal predictions. We predict the NPs distribution given the TME components of tumor vessels and cell nuclei, and the experimental results show that DAMM-Diffusion can generate the distribution of NPs with higher accuracy than the comparing methods. Additional results on the multi-modal brain image synthesis task further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sparse Autoencoder as a Zero-Shot Classifier for Concept Erasing in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09446v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating high-quality images but also raise people's concerns about generating harmful or misleading content. While extensive approaches have been proposed to erase unwanted concepts without requiring retraining from scratch, they inadvertently degrade performance on normal generation tasks. In this work, we propose Interpret then Deactivate (ItD), a novel framework to enable precise concept removal in T2I diffusion models while preserving overall performance. ItD first employs a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to interpret each concept as a combination of multiple features. By permanently deactivating the specific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a zero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target concepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we demonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without requiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity identities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's effectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal concept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial prompts designed to circumvent content filters.

| **[Alias-Free Latent Diffusion Models:Improving Fractional Shift Equivariance of Diffusion Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09419v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are known to have an unstable generation process, where even small perturbations or shifts in the input noise can lead to significantly different outputs. This hinders their applicability in applications requiring consistent results. In this work, we redesign LDMs to enhance consistency by making them shift-equivariant. While introducing anti-aliasing operations can partially improve shift-equivariance, significant aliasing and inconsistency persist due to the unique challenges in LDMs, including 1) aliasing amplification during VAE training and multiple U-Net inferences, and 2) self-attention modules that inherently lack shift-equivariance. To address these issues, we redesign the attention modules to be shift-equivariant and propose an equivariance loss that effectively suppresses the frequency bandwidth of the features in the continuous domain. The resulting alias-free LDM (AF-LDM) achieves strong shift-equivariance and is also robust to irregular warping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AF-LDM produces significantly more consistent results than vanilla LDM across various applications, including video editing and image-to-image translation.

| **[Monte Carlo Diffusion for Generalizable Learning-Based RANSAC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09410v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) is a fundamental approach for robustly estimating parametric models from noisy data. Existing learning-based RANSAC methods utilize deep learning to enhance the robustness of RANSAC against outliers. However, these approaches are trained and tested on the data generated by the same algorithms, leading to limited generalization to out-of-distribution data during inference. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based paradigm that progressively injects noise into ground-truth data, simulating the noisy conditions for training learning-based RANSAC. To enhance data diversity, we incorporate Monte Carlo sampling into the diffusion paradigm, approximating diverse data distributions by introducing different types of randomness at multiple stages. We evaluate our approach in the context of feature matching through comprehensive experiments on the ScanNet and MegaDepth datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our Monte Carlo diffusion mechanism significantly improves the generalization ability of learning-based RANSAC. We also develop extensive ablation studies that highlight the effectiveness of key components in our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple and Effective Reinforcement Learning Method for Text-to-Image Diffusion Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00897v4)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning diffusion models with black-box objectives. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy optimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive to hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE, on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose leave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP combines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling multiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the robustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling. Our results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on various black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between computational efficiency and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Few-Step Diffusion Models by Trajectory Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06674v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating diffusion model sampling is crucial for efficient AIGC deployment. While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution matching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation offers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a data-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different steps, enabling more adjustable sampling. This approach supports both deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency. Our model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced training costs. In particular, our method distills PixArt-$\alpha$ into a 4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024 resolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a mere 0.01% of the teacher's training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65.

| **[Adding Additional Control to One-Step Diffusion with Joint Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06652v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion distillation has enabled one-step generation through methods like Variational Score Distillation, adapting distilled models to emerging new controls -- such as novel structural constraints or latest user preferences -- remains challenging. Conventional approaches typically requires modifying the base diffusion model and redistilling it -- a process that is both computationally intensive and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce Joint Distribution Matching (JDM), a novel approach that minimizes the reverse KL divergence between image-condition joint distributions. By deriving a tractable upper bound, JDM decouples fidelity learning from condition learning. This asymmetric distillation scheme enables our one-step student to handle controls unknown to the teacher model and facilitates improved classifier-free guidance (CFG) usage and seamless integration of human feedback learning (HFL). Experimental results demonstrate that JDM surpasses baseline methods such as multi-step ControlNet by mere one-step in most cases, while achieving state-of-the-art performance in one-step text-to-image synthesis through improved usage of CFG or HFL integration.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a theoretical mode-tracking process capable of pinpointing the exact mode of the denoising distribution, and we propose a practical high-density sampler that consistently generates images of higher likelihood than usual samplers. Our empirical findings reveal the existence of significantly higher likelihood samples that typical samplers do not produce, often manifesting as cartoon-like drawings or blurry images depending on the noise level. Curiously, these patterns emerge in datasets devoid of such examples. We also present a novel approach to track sample likelihoods in diffusion SDEs, which remarkably incurs no additional computational cost.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Although existing methods can guide generation beyond text prompts, the challenge of effectively combining multiple conditional inputs while maintaining consistency with all of them remains unsolved. To address this, we introduce UniCombine, a DiT-based multi-conditional controllable generative framework capable of handling any combination of conditions, including but not limited to text prompts, spatial maps, and subject images. Specifically, we introduce a novel Conditional MMDiT Attention mechanism and incorporate a trainable LoRA module to build both the training-free and training-based versions. Additionally, we propose a new pipeline to construct SubjectSpatial200K, the first dataset designed for multi-conditional generative tasks covering both the subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditions. Extensive experimental results on multi-conditional generation demonstrate the outstanding universality and powerful capability of our approach with state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incomplete Multi-view Clustering via Diffusion Contrastive Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09185v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to the common issue of missing data in multi-view datasets. The primary approach to address this challenge involves recovering the missing views before applying conventional multi-view clustering methods. Although imputation-based IMVC methods have achieved significant improvements, they still encounter notable limitations: 1) heavy reliance on paired data for training the data recovery module, which is impractical in real scenarios with high missing data rates; 2) the generated data often lacks diversity and discriminability, resulting in suboptimal clustering results. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel IMVC method called Diffusion Contrastive Generation (DCG). Motivated by the consistency between the diffusion and clustering processes, DCG learns the distribution characteristics to enhance clustering by applying forward diffusion and reverse denoising processes to intra-view data. By performing contrastive learning on a limited set of paired multi-view samples, DCG can align the generated views with the real views, facilitating accurate recovery of views across arbitrary missing view scenarios. Additionally, DCG integrates instance-level and category-level interactive learning to exploit the consistent and complementary information available in multi-view data, achieving robust and end-to-end clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Concept Attribution in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02542v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable abilities in generating realistic and high-quality images from text prompts. However, a trained model remains largely black-box; little do we know about the roles of its components in exhibiting a concept such as objects or styles. Recent works employ causal tracing to localize knowledge-storing layers in generative models without showing how other layers contribute to the target concept. In this work, we approach diffusion models' interpretability problem from a more general perspective and pose a question: \textit{``How do model components work jointly to demonstrate knowledge?''}. To answer this question, we decompose diffusion models using component attribution, systematically unveiling the importance of each component (specifically the model parameter) in generating a concept. The proposed framework, called \textbf{C}omponent \textbf{A}ttribution for \textbf{D}iffusion Model (CAD), discovers the localization of concept-inducing (positive) components, while interestingly uncovers another type of components that contribute negatively to generating a concept, which is missing in the previous knowledge localization work. Based on this holistic understanding of diffusion models, we introduce two fast, inference-time model editing algorithms, CAD-Erase and CAD-Amplify; in particular, CAD-Erase enables erasure and CAD-Amplify allows amplification of a generated concept by ablating the positive and negative components, respectively, while retaining knowledge of other concepts. Extensive experimental results validate the significance of both positive and negative components pinpointed by our framework, demonstrating the potential of providing a complete view of interpreting generative models.

| **[AdvAD: Exploring Non-Parametric Diffusion for Imperceptible Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09124v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imperceptible adversarial attacks aim to fool DNNs by adding imperceptible perturbation to the input data. Previous methods typically improve the imperceptibility of attacks by integrating common attack paradigms with specifically designed perception-based losses or the capabilities of generative models. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Attacks in Diffusion (AdvAD), a novel modeling framework distinct from existing attack paradigms. AdvAD innovatively conceptualizes attacking as a non-parametric diffusion process by theoretically exploring basic modeling approach rather than using the denoising or generation abilities of regular diffusion models requiring neural networks. At each step, much subtler yet effective adversarial guidance is crafted using only the attacked model without any additional network, which gradually leads the end of diffusion process from the original image to a desired imperceptible adversarial example. Grounded in a solid theoretical foundation of the proposed non-parametric diffusion process, AdvAD achieves high attack efficacy and imperceptibility with intrinsically lower overall perturbation strength. Additionally, an enhanced version AdvAD-X is proposed to evaluate the extreme of our novel framework under an ideal scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AdvAD and AdvAD-X. Compared with state-of-the-art imperceptible attacks, AdvAD achieves an average of 99.9$\%$ (+17.3$\%$) ASR with 1.34 (-0.97) $l_2$ distance, 49.74 (+4.76) PSNR and 0.9971 (+0.0043) SSIM against four prevalent DNNs with three different architectures on the ImageNet-compatible dataset.

| **[On the Generalization Properties of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01797v4)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are a class of generative models that serve to establish a stochastic transport map between an empirically observed, yet unknown, target distribution and a known prior. Despite their remarkable success in real-world applications, a theoretical understanding of their generalization capabilities remains underdeveloped. This work embarks on a comprehensive theoretical exploration of the generalization attributes of diffusion models. We establish theoretical estimates of the generalization gap that evolves in tandem with the training dynamics of score-based diffusion models, suggesting a polynomially small generalization error ($O(n^{-2/5}+m^{-4/5})$) on both the sample size $n$ and the model capacity $m$, evading the curse of dimensionality (i.e., not exponentially large in the data dimension) when early-stopped. Furthermore, we extend our quantitative analysis to a data-dependent scenario, wherein target distributions are portrayed as a succession of densities with progressively increasing distances between modes. This precisely elucidates the adverse effect of "modes shift" in ground truths on the model generalization. Moreover, these estimates are not solely theoretical constructs but have also been confirmed through numerical simulations. Our findings contribute to the rigorous understanding of diffusion models' generalization properties and provide insights that may guide practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Simple Principles for Diffusion-Based Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05274v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based test-time adaptations (TTA) have shown great advances, which leverage a diffusion model to map the images in the unknown test domain to the training domain. The unseen and diverse test domains make diffusion-based TTA an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we unravel two simple principles of the design tricks for diffusion-based methods. Intuitively, \textit{Principle 1} says semantic similarity preserving. We should preserve the semantic similarity between the original and generated test images. \textit{Principle 2} suggests minimal modifications. This principle enables the diffusion to map the test images to the training domain with minimal modifications of the test images. In particular, following the two principles, we propose our simple yet effective principle-guided diffusion-based test-time adaptation method (PDDA). Concretely, following Principle 1, we propose a semantic keeper, the method to preserve feature similarity, where the semantic keeper could filter the corruption introduced from the test domain, thus better preserving the semantics. Following Principle 2, we propose a modification keeper, where we introduce a regularization constraint into the generative process to minimize modifications to the test image. Meanwhile, there is a hidden conflict between the two principles. We further introduce the gradient-based view to unify the direction generated from two principles. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-W, and ImageNet-C with WideResNet-28-10, ResNet-50, Swin-T, and ConvNext-T demonstrate that PDDA significantly performs better than the complex state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, PDDA achieves 2.4\% average accuracy improvements in ImageNet-C without any training process.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAViD: Modeling Dynamic Affordance of 3D Objects using Pre-trained Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08333v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling how humans interact with objects is crucial for AI to effectively assist or mimic human behaviors. Existing studies for learning such ability primarily focus on static human-object interaction (HOI) patterns, such as contact and spatial relationships, while dynamic HOI patterns, capturing the movement of humans and objects over time, remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel framework for learning Dynamic Affordance across various target object categories. To address the scarcity of 4D HOI datasets, our method learns the 3D dynamic affordance from synthetically generated 4D HOI samples. Specifically, we propose a pipeline that first generates 2D HOI videos from a given 3D target object using a pre-trained video diffusion model, then lifts them into 3D to generate 4D HOI samples. Leveraging these synthesized 4D HOI samples, we train DAViD, our generative 4D human-object interaction model, which is composed of two key components: (1) a human motion diffusion model (MDM) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to fine-tune a pre-trained MDM to learn the HOI motion concepts from limited HOI motion samples, (2) a motion diffusion model for 4D object poses conditioned by produced human interaction motions. Interestingly, DAViD can integrate newly learned HOI motion concepts with pre-trained human motions to create novel HOI motions, even for multiple HOI motion concepts, demonstrating the advantage of our pipeline with LoRA in integrating dynamic HOI concepts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DAViD outperforms baselines in synthesizing HOI motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://snuvclab.github.io/david/</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Fine-Tuning and Concept Suppression for Pruned Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15341v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion generative models have yielded remarkable progress. While the quality of generated content continues to improve, these models have grown considerably in size and complexity. This increasing computational burden poses significant challenges, particularly in resource-constrained deployment scenarios such as mobile devices. The combination of model pruning and knowledge distillation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational demands while preserving generation quality. However, this technique inadvertently propagates undesirable behaviors, including the generation of copyrighted content and unsafe concepts, even when such instances are absent from the fine-tuning dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel bilevel optimization framework for pruned diffusion models that consolidates the fine-tuning and unlearning processes into a unified phase. Our approach maintains the principal advantages of distillation-namely, efficient convergence and style transfer capabilities-while selectively suppressing the generation of unwanted content. This plug-in framework is compatible with various pruning and concept unlearning methods, facilitating efficient, safe deployment of diffusion models in controlled environments.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Voltage-Controlled Magnetoelectric Devices for Neuromorphic Diffusion Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12261v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic diffusion processes are pervasive in nature, from the seemingly erratic Brownian motion to the complex interactions of synaptically-coupled spiking neurons. Recently, drawing inspiration from Langevin dynamics, neuromorphic diffusion models were proposed and have become one of the major breakthroughs in the field of generative artificial intelligence. Unlike discriminative models that have been well developed to tackle classification or regression tasks, diffusion models as well as other generative models such as ChatGPT aim at creating content based upon contexts learned. However, the more complex algorithms of these models result in high computational costs using today's technologies, creating a bottleneck in their efficiency, and impeding further development. Here, we develop a spintronic voltage-controlled magnetoelectric memory hardware for the neuromorphic diffusion process. The in-memory computing capability of our spintronic devices goes beyond current Von Neumann architecture, where memory and computing units are separated. Together with the non-volatility of magnetic memory, we can achieve high-speed and low-cost computing, which is desirable for the increasing scale of generative models in the current era. We experimentally demonstrate that the hardware-based true random diffusion process can be implemented for image generation and achieve comparable image quality to software-based training as measured by the Frechet inception distance (FID) score, achieving ~10^3 better energy-per-bit-per-area over traditional hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[SICNav-Diffusion: Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation with Diffusion Trajectory Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08858v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To navigate crowds without collisions, robots must interact with humans by forecasting their future motion and reacting accordingly. While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polyhedra Encoding Transformers: Enhancing Diffusion MRI Analysis Beyond Voxel and Volumetric Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13352v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is an essential tool in neuroimaging. It is arguably the sole noninvasive technique for examining the microstructural properties and structural connectivity of the brain. Recent years have seen the emergence of machine learning and data-driven approaches that enhance the speed, accuracy, and consistency of dMRI data analysis. However, traditional deep learning models often fell short, as they typically utilize pixel-level or volumetric patch-level embeddings similar to those used in structural MRI, and do not account for the unique distribution of various gradient encodings. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Polyhedra Encoding Transformer (PE-Transformer) for dMRI, designed specifically to handle spherical signals. Our approach involves projecting an icosahedral polygon onto a unit sphere to resample signals from predetermined directions. These resampled signals are then transformed into embeddings, which are processed by a transformer encoder that incorporates orientational information reflective of the icosahedral structure. Through experimental validation with various gradient encoding protocols, our method demonstrates superior accuracy in estimating multi-compartment models and Fiber Orientation Distributions (FOD), outperforming both conventional CNN architectures and standard transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEAT: Multiview Diffusion Model for Human Generation on Megapixels with Mesh Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08664v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview diffusion models have shown considerable success in image-to-3D generation for general objects. However, when applied to human data, existing methods have yet to deliver promising results, largely due to the challenges of scaling multiview attention to higher resolutions. In this paper, we explore human multiview diffusion models at the megapixel level and introduce a solution called mesh attention to enable training at 1024x1024 resolution. Using a clothed human mesh as a central coarse geometric representation, the proposed mesh attention leverages rasterization and projection to establish direct cross-view coordinate correspondences. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of multiview attention while maintaining cross-view consistency. Building on this foundation, we devise a mesh attention block and combine it with keypoint conditioning to create our human-specific multiview diffusion model, MEAT. In addition, we present valuable insights into applying multiview human motion videos for diffusion training, addressing the longstanding issue of data scarcity. Extensive experiments show that MEAT effectively generates dense, consistent multiview human images at the megapixel level, outperforming existing multiview diffusion methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

However, the T2I models that underpin these methods have become outdated, thereby limiting the potential for further improvement in VTO. Additionally, current methods face notable challenges in accurately rendering text on garments without distortion and preserving fine-grained details, such as textures and material fidelity. The emergence of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) based T2I models has showcased impressive performance and offers a promising opportunity for advancing VTO. Directly applying existing VTO techniques to transformer-based T2I models is ineffective due to substantial architectural differences, which hinder their ability to fully leverage the models' advanced capabilities for improved text generation. To address these challenges and unlock the full potential of DiT-based T2I models for VTO, we propose TED-VITON, a novel framework that integrates a Garment Semantic (GS) Adapter for enhancing garment-specific features, a Text Preservation Loss to ensure accurate and distortion-free text rendering, and a constraint mechanism to generate prompts by optimizing Large Language Model (LLM). These innovations enable state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in visual quality and text fidelity, establishing a new benchmark for VTO task.

Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical concepts such as Markov chains and SDEs. 3) Guided by this simple framework, more efficient inference methods can be discovered.</p></details> |  |

Our method optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts using pretrained diffusion models. Our key insight is to leverage 2D inpainting diffusion models conditioned on an initial scene estimate to provide low variance supervision for unknown regions during 3D distillation. In conjunction, we imbue high-fidelity geometry with geometric distillation from a depth diffusion model, conditioned on samples from the inpainting model. We find that the initialization of the optimization is crucial, and provide a principled methodology for doing so. Notably, our technique doesn't require video or multi-view data and can synthesize various high-quality 3D scenes in different styles with complex layouts. Further, the generality of our method allows 3D synthesis from a single image. As measured by a comprehensive user study, our method outperforms all existing approaches, preferred by 88-95%.

In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

However, the modular composition of multiple concepts into a customized model, aimed to efficiently merge decentralized-trained concepts without influencing their identities, remains unresolved. Modular customization is essential for applications like concept stylization and multi-concept customization using concepts trained by different users. Existing post-training methods are only confined to a fixed set of concepts, and any different combinations require a new round of retraining. In contrast, instant merging methods often cause identity loss and interference of individual merged concepts and are usually limited to a small number of concepts. To address these issues, we propose BlockLoRA, an instant merging method designed to efficiently combine multiple concepts while accurately preserving individual concepts' identity. With a careful analysis of the underlying reason for interference, we develop the Randomized Output Erasure technique to minimize the interference of different customized models. Additionally, Blockwise LoRA Parameterization is proposed to reduce the identity loss during instant model merging. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BlockLoRA, which can instantly merge 15 concepts of people, subjects, scenes, and styles with high fidelity.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have demonstrated significant progress in directly mapping sinograms to PET images. However, regression-based DL models often yield overly smoothed reconstructions lacking of details (i.e., low distortion, low perceptual quality), whereas GAN-based and likelihood-based posterior sampling models tend to introduce undesirable artifacts in predictions (i.e., high distortion, high perceptual quality), limiting their clinical applicability. To achieve a robust perception-distortion tradeoff, we propose Posterior-Mean Denoising Diffusion Model (PMDM-PET), a novel approach that builds upon a recently established mathematical theory to explore the closed-form expression of perception-distortion function in diffusion model space for PET image reconstruction from sinograms. Specifically, PMDM-PET first obtained posterior-mean PET predictions under minimum mean square error (MSE), then optimally transports the distribution of them to the ground-truth PET images distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that PMDM-PET not only generates realistic PET images with possible minimum distortion and optimal perceptual quality but also outperforms five recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL baselines in both qualitative visual inspection and quantitative pixel-wise metrics PSNR (dB)/SSIM/NRMSE.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

Building on this, we extend diffusion models to point cloud semantic segmentation, where point positions also remain fixed, and the diffusion model generates point labels instead of colors. To accelerate the denoising process in reverse diffusion, we introduce a noisy label embedding mechanism. This approach integrates semantic information into the noisy label, providing an initial semantic reference that improves the reverse diffusion efficiency. Additionally, we propose a point frequency transformer that enhances the adjustment of high-level context in point clouds. To reduce computational complexity, we introduce the position condition into MLP and propose denoising PointNet to process the high-resolution point cloud without sacrificing geometric details. Finally, we integrate the proposed noisy label embedding, point frequency transformer and denoising PointNet in our proposed dual conditional diffusion model-based network (PointDiffuse) to perform large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of PointDiffuse, achieving the state-of-the-art mIoU of 74.2\% on S3DIS Area 5, 81.2\% on S3DIS 6-fold and 64.8\% on SWAN dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Neural Switching via Drift-Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00781v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural encoding is a field in neuroscience that focuses on characterizing how information from stimuli is encoded in the spiking activity of neurons. When more than one stimulus is present, a theory known as multiplexing posits that neurons temporally switch between encoding various stimuli, creating a fluctuating firing pattern. Here, we propose a new statistical framework to analyze rate fluctuations and discern whether neurons employ multiplexing as a means of encoding multiple stimuli. We adopt a mechanistic approach to modeling multiplexing by constructing a non-Markovian endogenous state-space model. Specifically, we posit that multiplexing arises from competition between the stimuli, which are modeled as latent drift-diffusion processes. We propose a new MCMC algorithm for conducting posterior inference on similar types of state-space models, where typical state-space MCMC methods fail due to strong dependence between the parameters. In addition, we develop alternative models that represent a wide class of alternative encoding theories and perform model comparison using WAIC to determine whether the data suggest the occurrence multiplexing over alternative theories of neural encoding. Using the proposed framework, we provide evidence of multiplexing within the inferior colliculus and novel insight into the switching dynamics.</p></details> |  |

This paper focuses on structure-preserving diffusion models (SPDM), a specific subset of diffusion processes tailored for distributions with inherent structures, such as group symmetries. We complement existing sufficient conditions for constructing SPDMs by proving complementary necessary ones. Additionally, we propose a new framework that considers the geometric structures affecting the diffusion process. Leveraging this framework, we design a structure-preserving bridge model that maintains alignment between the model's endpoint couplings. Empirical evaluations on equivariant diffusion models demonstrate their effectiveness in learning symmetric distributions and modeling transitions between them. Experiments on real-world medical images confirm that our models preserve equivariance while maintaining high sample quality. We also showcase the practical utility of our framework by implementing an equivariant denoising diffusion bridge model, which achieves reliable equivariant image noise reduction and style transfer, irrespective of prior knowledge of image orientation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Controlling Latent Diffusion Using Latent CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08455v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instead of performing text-conditioned denoising in the image domain, latent diffusion models (LDMs) operate in latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE), enabling more efficient processing at reduced computational costs. However, while the diffusion process has moved to the latent space, the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models, as used in many image processing tasks, still operate in pixel space. Doing so requires costly VAE-decoding of latent images before they can be processed. In this paper, we introduce Latent-CLIP, a CLIP model that operates directly in the latent space. We train Latent-CLIP on 2.7B pairs of latent images and descriptive texts, and show that it matches zero-shot classification performance of similarly sized CLIP models on both the ImageNet benchmark and a LDM-generated version of it, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing both real and generated content. Furthermore, we construct Latent-CLIP rewards for reward-based noise optimization (ReNO) and show that they match the performance of their CLIP counterparts on GenEval and T2I-CompBench while cutting the cost of the total pipeline by 21%. Finally, we use Latent-CLIP to guide generation away from harmful content, achieving strong performance on the inappropriate image prompts (I2P) benchmark and a custom evaluation, without ever requiring the costly step of decoding intermediate images.</p></details> |  |

This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently altering the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. By grounding depth-of-field adjustments, our method preserves the underlying scene structure as the level of blur is varied. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations.

| **[Using Powerful Prior Knowledge of Diffusion Model in Deep Unfolding Networks for Image Compressive Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08429v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) have achieved impressive reconstruction quality in the field of image Compressive Sensing (CS) by unfolding iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks. The reconstruction quality of DUNs depends on the learned prior knowledge, so introducing stronger prior knowledge can further improve reconstruction quality. On the other hand, pre-trained diffusion models contain powerful prior knowledge and have a solid theoretical foundation and strong scalability, but it requires a large number of iterative steps to achieve reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to use the powerful prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model in DUNs to achieve high-quality reconstruction with less steps for image CS. Specifically, we first design an iterative optimization algorithm named Diffusion Message Passing (DMP), which embeds a pre-trained diffusion model into each iteration process of DMP. Then, we deeply unfold the DMP algorithm into a neural network named DMP-DUN. The proposed DMP-DUN can use lightweight neural networks to achieve mapping from measurement data to the intermediate steps of the reverse diffusion process and directly approximate the divergence of the diffusion model, thereby further improving reconstruction efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our proposed DMP-DUN achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires at least only 2 steps to reconstruct the image.

In this work, we introduce AnyMoLe, a novel method that addresses this limitation by leveraging video diffusion models to generate motion in-between frames for arbitrary characters without external data. Our approach employs a two-stage frame generation process to enhance contextual understanding. Furthermore, to bridge the domain gap between real-world and rendered character animations, we introduce ICAdapt, a fine-tuning technique for video diffusion models. Additionally, we propose a ``motion-video mimicking'' optimization technique, enabling seamless motion generation for characters with arbitrary joint structures using 2D and 3D-aware features. AnyMoLe significantly reduces data dependency while generating smooth and realistic transitions, making it applicable to a wide range of motion in-betweening tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, CVPR 2025</p></details> |

A recent family for these improvements uses diffusion models, which have become essential for achieving high-quality video inpainting results, yet they still face performance bottlenecks in temporal consistency and computational efficiency. This motivates us to propose a new video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided Efficient Diffusion (FloED) for higher video coherence. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where the time-agnostic flow branch restores corrupted flow first, and the multi-scale flow adapters provide motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Besides, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. With the flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the computational cost of incorporating optical flow. Extensive experiments on background restoration and object removal tasks show that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in both quality and efficiency. Our codes and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nevsnev.github.io/FloED/</p></details> |

However, most existing style transfer methods can only render consistent artistic stylized images, making it difficult for users to get enough stylized images to enjoy. To solve this issue, we propose a novel artistic style transfer framework called DyArtbank, which can generate diverse and highly realistic artistic stylized images. Specifically, we introduce a Dynamic Style Prompt ArtBank (DSPA), a set of learnable parameters. It can learn and store the style information from the collection of artworks, dynamically guiding pre-trained stable diffusion to generate diverse and highly realistic artistic stylized images. DSPA can also generate random artistic image samples with the learned style information, providing a new idea for data augmentation. Besides, a Key Content Feature Prompt (KCFP) module is proposed to provide sufficient content prompts for pre-trained stable diffusion to preserve the detailed structure of the input content image. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

A common solution is to leverage the feedback provided by quality assessment systems or human annotators to optimize the model, where images are generally rated in their entirety. In this work, we believe problem-solving starts with identification, yielding the request that the model should be aware of not just the presence of defects in an image, but their specific locations. Motivated by this, we propose DiffDoctor, a two-stage pipeline to assist image diffusion models in generating fewer artifacts. Concretely, the first stage targets developing a robust artifact detector, for which we collect a dataset of over 1M flawed synthesized images and set up an efficient human-in-the-loop annotation process, incorporating a carefully designed class-balance strategy. The learned artifact detector is then involved in the second stage to optimize the diffusion model by providing pixel-level feedback. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness of our artifact detector as well as the soundness of our diagnose-then-treat design.</p></details> | 8 pages of main body |
| **[Diffusion Transformer Meets Random Masks: An Advanced PET Reconstruction Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08339v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has significantly advanced PET image re-construction, achieving remarkable improvements in image quality through direct training on sinogram or image data. Traditional methods often utilize masks for inpainting tasks, but their incorporation into PET reconstruction frameworks introduces transformative potential. In this study, we pro-pose an advanced PET reconstruction framework called Diffusion tRansformer mEets rAndom Masks (DREAM). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate mask mechanisms into both the sinogram domain and the latent space, pioneering their role in PET reconstruction and demonstrating their ability to enhance reconstruction fidelity and efficiency. The framework employs a high-dimensional stacking approach, transforming masked data from two to three dimensions to expand the solution space and enable the model to capture richer spatial rela-tionships. Additionally, a mask-driven latent space is de-signed to accelerate the diffusion process by leveraging sinogram-driven and mask-driven compact priors, which reduce computational complexity while preserving essen-tial data characteristics. A hierarchical masking strategy is also introduced, guiding the model from focusing on fi-ne-grained local details in the early stages to capturing broader global patterns over time. This progressive ap-proach ensures a balance between detailed feature preservation and comprehensive context understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that DREAM not only improves the overall quality of reconstructed PET images but also preserves critical clinical details, highlighting its potential to advance PET imaging technology. By inte-grating compact priors and hierarchical masking, DREAM offers a promising and efficient avenue for future research and application in PET imaging. The open-source code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/DREAM.</p></details> |  |

However, aligning discrete diffusion models with task-specific preferences remains challenging, particularly in scenarios where explicit reward functions are unavailable. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion DPO (D3PO), the first adaptation of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to discrete diffusion models formulated as continuous-time Markov chains. Our approach derives a novel loss function that directly fine-tunes the generative process using preference data while preserving fidelity to a reference distribution. We validate D3PO on a structured binary sequence generation task, demonstrating that the method effectively aligns model outputs with preferences while maintaining structural validity. Our results highlight that D3PO enables controlled fine-tuning without requiring explicit reward models, making it a practical alternative to reinforcement learning-based approaches. Future research will explore extending D3PO to more complex generative tasks, including language modeling and protein sequence generation, as well as investigating alternative noise schedules, such as uniform noising, to enhance flexibility across different applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a co-learning framework that jointly optimizes a single-step diffusion-based upsampler and a learnable downsampler, enhanced by two discriminators and a cyclic distillation strategy. Our learnable downsampler is designed to better capture realistic degradation patterns while preserving structural details in the LR domain, which is crucial for enhancing SR performance. By leveraging a diffusion-based approach, our model generates diverse LR-HR pairs during training, enabling robust learning across varying degradations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both general real-world and domain-specific face SR tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Our approach not only improves efficiency with a single inference step but also ensures high-quality image reconstruction, bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world SR scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[OminiControl2: Efficient Conditioning for Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08280v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained control of text-to-image diffusion transformer models (DiT) remains a critical challenge for practical deployment. While recent advances such as OminiControl and others have enabled a controllable generation of diverse control signals, these methods face significant computational inefficiency when handling long conditional inputs. We present OminiControl2, an efficient framework that achieves efficient image-conditional image generation. OminiControl2 introduces two key innovations: (1) a dynamic compression strategy that streamlines conditional inputs by preserving only the most semantically relevant tokens during generation, and (2) a conditional feature reuse mechanism that computes condition token features only once and reuses them across denoising steps. These architectural improvements preserve the original framework's parameter efficiency and multi-modal versatility while dramatically reducing computational costs. Our experiments demonstrate that OminiControl2 reduces conditional processing overhead by over 90% compared to its predecessor, achieving an overall 5.9$\times$ speedup in multi-conditional generation scenarios. This efficiency enables the practical implementation of complex, multi-modal control for high-quality image synthesis with DiT models.</p></details> |  |

Current image conditioning methods either introduce substantial parameter overhead or handle only specific control tasks effectively, limiting their practical versatility. OminiControl addresses these limitations through three key innovations: (1) a minimal architectural design that leverages the DiT's own VAE encoder and transformer blocks, requiring just 0.1% additional parameters; (2) a unified sequence processing strategy that combines condition tokens with image tokens for flexible token interactions; and (3) a dynamic position encoding mechanism that adapts to both spatially-aligned and non-aligned control tasks. Our extensive experiments show that this streamlined approach not only matches but surpasses the performance of specialized methods across multiple conditioning tasks. To overcome data limitations in subject-driven generation, we also introduce Subjects200K, a large-scale dataset of identity-consistent image pairs synthesized using DiT models themselves. This work demonstrates that effective image control can be achieved without architectural complexity, opening new possibilities for efficient and versatile image generation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARA: Structural and Adversarial Representation Alignment for Training-efficient Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08253v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern diffusion models encounter a fundamental trade-off between training efficiency and generation quality. While existing representation alignment methods, such as REPA, accelerate convergence through patch-wise alignment, they often fail to capture structural relationships within visual representations and ensure global distribution consistency between pretrained encoders and denoising networks. To address these limitations, we introduce SARA, a hierarchical alignment framework that enforces multi-level representation constraints: (1) patch-wise alignment to preserve local semantic details, (2) autocorrelation matrix alignment to maintain structural consistency within representations, and (3) adversarial distribution alignment to mitigate global representation discrepancies. Unlike previous approaches, SARA explicitly models both intra-representation correlations via self-similarity matrices and inter-distribution coherence via adversarial alignment, enabling comprehensive alignment across local and global scales. Experiments on ImageNet-256 show that SARA achieves an FID of 1.36 while converging twice as fast as REPA, surpassing recent state-of-the-art image generation methods. This work establishes a systematic paradigm for optimizing diffusion training through hierarchical representation alignment.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Aligning Text to Image in Diffusion Models is Easier Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08250v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</p></details> |  |

Recently, some methods have resorted to diffusion models for guidance, optimizing a 3D representation via Score Distillation Sampling(SDS) or generating one back-view image for facilitating reconstruction. However, these methods tend to produce unsatisfactory artifacts (\textit{e.g.} flattened human structure or over-smoothing results caused by inconsistent priors from multiple views) and struggle with real-world generalization in the wild. In this work, we present \emph{MVD-HuGaS}, enabling free-view 3D human rendering from a single image via a multi-view human diffusion model. We first generate multi-view images from the single reference image with an enhanced multi-view diffusion model, which is well fine-tuned on high-quality 3D human datasets to incorporate 3D geometry priors and human structure priors. To infer accurate camera poses from the sparse generated multi-view images for reconstruction, an alignment module is introduced to facilitate joint optimization of 3D Gaussians and camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a depth-based Facial Distortion Mitigation module to refine the generated facial regions, thereby improving the overall fidelity of the reconstruction.Finally, leveraging the refined multi-view images, along with their accurate camera poses, MVD-HuGaS optimizes the 3D Gaussians of the target human for high-fidelity free-view renderings. Extensive experiments on Thuman2.0 and 2K2K datasets show that the proposed MVD-HuGaS achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-view 3D human rendering.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose AnomalyPainter, a zero-shot framework that breaks the diversity-realism trade-off dilemma through synergizing Vision Language Large Model (VLLM), Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), and our newly introduced texture library Tex-9K. Tex-9K is a professional texture library containing 75 categories and 8,792 texture assets crafted for diverse anomaly synthesis. Leveraging VLLM's general knowledge, reasonable anomaly text descriptions are generated for each industrial object and matched with relevant diverse textures from Tex-9K. These textures then guide the LDM via ControlNet to paint on normal images. Furthermore, we introduce Texture-Aware Latent Init to stabilize the natural-image-trained ControlNet for industrial images. Extensive experiments show that AnomalyPainter outperforms existing methods in realism, diversity, and generalization, achieving superior downstream performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>anoma...</summary><p>anomaly synthesis,anomaly detection</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Guided Diffusion Models for Adversarial Purification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16067v5)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion model (DM) based adversarial purification (AP) has proven to be a powerful defense method that can remove adversarial perturbations and generate a purified example without threats. In principle, the pre-trained DMs can only ensure that purified examples conform to the same distribution of the training data, but it may inadvertently compromise the semantic information of input examples, leading to misclassification of purified examples. Recent advancements introduce guided diffusion techniques to preserve semantic information while removing the perturbations. However, these guidances often rely on distance measures between purified examples and diffused examples, which can also preserve perturbations in purified examples. To further unleash the robustness power of DM-based AP, we propose an adversarial guided diffusion model (AGDM) by introducing a novel adversarial guidance that contains sufficient semantic information but does not explicitly involve adversarial perturbations. The guidance is modeled by an auxiliary neural network obtained with adversarial training, considering the distance in the latent representations rather than at the pixel-level values. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet to demonstrate that our method is effective for simultaneously maintaining semantic information and removing the adversarial perturbations. In addition, comprehensive comparisons show that our method significantly enhances the robustness of existing DM-based AP, with an average robust accuracy improved by up to 7.30% on CIFAR-10.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single Image Rolling Shutter Removal with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02906v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RS-Diffusion, the first Diffusion Models-based method for single-frame Rolling Shutter (RS) correction. RS artifacts compromise visual quality of frames due to the row-wise exposure of CMOS sensors. Most previous methods have focused on multi-frame approaches, using temporal information from consecutive frames for the motion rectification. However, few approaches address the more challenging but important single frame RS correction. In this work, we present an ``image-to-motion" framework via diffusion techniques, with a designed patch-attention module. In addition, we present the RS-Real dataset, comprised of captured RS frames alongside their corresponding Global Shutter (GS) ground-truth pairs. The GS frames are corrected from the RS ones, guided by the corresponding Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) gyroscope data acquired during capture. Experiments show that RS-Diffusion surpasses previous single-frame RS methods, demonstrates the potential of diffusion-based approaches, and provides a valuable dataset for further research.</p></details> |  |

Existing artistic style transfer methods can be categorized into style reconstruction-based and content-style disentanglement-based style transfer approaches. Although these methods can generate some artistic stylized images, they still exhibit obvious artifacts and disharmonious patterns, which hinder their ability to produce ultra-high quality artistic stylized images. To address these issues, we propose a novel artistic image style transfer method, U-StyDiT, which is built on transformer-based diffusion (DiT) and learns content-style disentanglement, generating ultra-high quality artistic stylized images. Specifically, we first design a Multi-view Style Modulator (MSM) to learn style information from a style image from local and global perspectives, conditioning U-StyDiT to generate stylized images with the learned style information. Then, we introduce a StyDiT Block to learn content and style conditions simultaneously from a style image. Additionally, we propose an ultra-high quality artistic image dataset, Aes4M, comprising 10 categories, each containing 400,000 style images. This dataset effectively solves the problem that the existing style transfer methods cannot produce high-quality artistic stylized images due to the size of the dataset and the quality of the images in the dataset. Finally, the extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments validate that our U-StyDiT can create higher quality stylized images compared to state-of-the-art artistic style transfer methods. To our knowledge, our proposed method is the first to address the generation of ultra-high quality stylized images using transformer-based diffusion.</p></details> |  |

To address this, here we introduce a novel latent diffusion inverse solver, regularization by text (TReg), inspired by the human ability to resolve visual ambiguities through perceptual biases. TReg integrates textual descriptions of preconceptions about the solution during reverse diffusion sampling, dynamically reinforcing these descriptions through null-text optimization, which we refer to as adaptive negation. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that TReg effectively mitigates ambiguity in inverse problems, improving both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

However, applying existing RL methods to step-distilled DMs is challenging for ultra-fast ($\le2$-step) image generation. Our analysis suggests several limitations of policy-based RL methods such as PPO or DPO toward this goal. Based on the insights, we propose fine-tuning DMs with learned differentiable surrogate rewards. Our method, named LaSRO, learns surrogate reward models in the latent space of SDXL to convert arbitrary rewards into differentiable ones for effective reward gradient guidance. LaSRO leverages pre-trained latent DMs for reward modeling and tailors reward optimization for $\le2$-step image generation with efficient off-policy exploration. LaSRO is effective and stable for improving ultra-fast image generation with different reward objectives, outperforming popular RL methods including DDPO and Diffusion-DPO. We further show LaSRO's connection to value-based RL, providing theoretical insights. See our webpage \href{https://sites.google.com/view/lasro}{here}.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

However, when employed for object removal tasks, they still encounter issues such as generating random artifacts and the incapacity to repaint foreground object areas with appropriate content after removal. To tackle these problems, we propose Attentive Eraser, a tuning-free method to empower pre-trained diffusion models for stable and effective object removal. Firstly, in light of the observation that the self-attention maps influence the structure and shape details of the generated images, we propose Attention Activation and Suppression (ASS), which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism within the pre-trained diffusion models based on the given mask, thereby prioritizing the background over the foreground object during the reverse generation process. Moreover, we introduce Self-Attention Redirection Guidance (SARG), which utilizes the self-attention redirected by ASS to guide the generation process, effectively removing foreground objects within the mask while simultaneously generating content that is both plausible and coherent. Experiments demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of Attentive Eraser in object removal across a variety of pre-trained diffusion models, outperforming even training-based methods. Furthermore, Attentive Eraser can be implemented in various diffusion model architectures and checkpoints, enabling excellent scalability.

Despite their capabilities, these models face persistent challenges in generating realistic human hands, often producing images with incorrect finger counts and structurally deformed hands. MGHanD addresses this challenge by applying multi-modal guidance during the inference process. For visual guidance, we employ a discriminator trained on a dataset comprising paired real and generated images with captions, derived from various hand-in-the-wild datasets. We also employ textual guidance with LoRA adapter, which learns the direction from `hands' towards more detailed prompts such as `natural hands', and `anatomically correct fingers' at the latent level. A cumulative hand mask which is gradually enlarged in the assigned time step is applied to the added guidance, allowing the hand to be refined while maintaining the rich generative capabilities of the pre-trained model. In the experiments, our method achieves superior hand generation qualities, without any specific conditions or priors. We carry out both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with user studies, to showcase the benefits of our approach in producing high-quality hand images.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

While concept editing is proposed to address these issues, they often struggle to balance the removal of unsafe concept with maintaining the model's general genera-tive capabilities. In this work, we propose ACE, a new editing method that enhances concept editing in diffusion models. ACE introduces a novel cross null-space projection approach to precisely erase unsafe concept while maintaining the model's ability to generate high-quality, semantically consistent images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACE significantly outperforms the advancing baselines,improving semantic consistency by 24.56% and image generation quality by 34.82% on average with only 1% of the time cost. These results highlight the practical utility of concept editing by mitigating its potential risks, paving the way for broader applications in the field.

This paper introduces COD-VAE, a VAE that encodes 3D shapes into a COmpact set of 1D latent vectors without sacrificing quality. COD-VAE introduces a two-stage autoencoder scheme to improve compression and decoding efficiency. First, our encoder block progressively compresses point clouds into compact latent vectors via intermediate point patches. Second, our triplane-based decoder reconstructs dense triplanes from latent vectors instead of directly decoding neural fields, significantly reducing computational overhead of neural fields decoding. Finally, we propose uncertainty-guided token pruning, which allocates resources adaptively by skipping computations in simpler regions and improves the decoder efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that COD-VAE achieves 16x compression compared to the baseline while maintaining quality. This enables 20.8x speedup in generation, highlighting that a large number of latent vectors is not a prerequisite for high-quality reconstruction and generation.</p></details> |  |

Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[STGDPM:Vessel Trajectory Prediction with Spatio-Temporal Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08065v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vessel trajectory prediction is a critical component for ensuring maritime traffic safety and avoiding collisions. Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

We present four key contributions to address the challenges of spatiotemporal video processing. First, we introduce the 3D Mobile Inverted Vector-Quantization Variational Autoencoder (3D-MBQ-VAE), which combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with masked token modeling to enhance spatiotemporal video compression. The model achieves superior temporal consistency and state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality by employing a novel training strategy with full frame masking. Second, we present MotionAura, a text-to-video generation framework that utilizes vector-quantized diffusion models to discretize the latent space and capture complex motion dynamics, producing temporally coherent videos aligned with text prompts. Third, we propose a spectral transformer-based denoising network that processes video data in the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform. This method effectively captures global context and long-range dependencies for high-quality video generation and denoising. Lastly, we introduce a downstream task of Sketch Guided Video Inpainting. This task leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our models achieve SOTA performance on a range of benchmarks. Our work offers robust frameworks for spatiotemporal modeling and user-driven video content manipulation. We will release the code, datasets, and models in open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025 (spotlight paper)</p></details> |
| **[Computational bottlenecks for denoising diffusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08028v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusions provide a general strategy to sample from a probability distribution $\mu$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by constructing a stochastic process $(\hat{\boldsymbol x}_t:t\ge 0)$ in ${\mathbb R}^d$ such that the distribution of $\hat{\boldsymbol x}_T$ at large times $T$ approximates $\mu$. The drift ${\boldsymbol m}:{\mathbb R}^d\times{\mathbb R}\to{\mathbb R}^d$ of this diffusion process is learned from data (samples from $\mu$) by minimizing the so-called score-matching objective. In order for the generating process to be efficient, it must be possible to evaluate (an approximation of) ${\boldsymbol m}({\boldsymbol y},t)$ in polynomial time. Is every probability distribution $\mu$, for which sampling is tractable, also amenable to sampling via diffusions? We provide evidence to the contrary by constructing a probability distribution $\mu$ for which sampling is easy, but the drift of the diffusion process is intractable -- under a popular conjecture on information-computation gaps in statistical estimation. We further show that any polynomial-time computable drift can be modified in a way that changes minimally the score matching objective and yet results in incorrect sampling.</p></details> | 36 pages |

To address this challenge, we propose DMin (Diffusion Model influence), a scalable framework for estimating the influence of each training data sample on a given generated image. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method capable of influence estimation for DMs with billions of parameters. Leveraging efficient gradient compression, DMin reduces storage requirements from hundreds of TBs to mere MBs or even KBs, and retrieves the top-k most influential training samples in under 1 second, all while maintaining performance. Our empirical results demonstrate DMin is both effective in identifying influential training samples and efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables.

| **[DiffEGG: Diffusion-Driven Edge Generation as a Pixel-Annotation-Free Alternative for Instance Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07982v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise panoptic segmentation relies on pixel-wise instance annotations, but obtaining such datasets is costly. Unsupervised instance segmentation (UIS) eliminates annotation requirements but struggles with adjacent instance merging and single-instance fragmentation, largely due to the limitations of DINO-based backbones which lack strong instance separation cues. Weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation (WPS) reduces annotation costs using sparse labels (e.g., points, boxes), yet these annotations remain expensive and introduce human bias and boundary errors. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEGG (Diffusion-Driven EdGe Generation), a fully annotation-free method that extracts instance-aware features from pretrained diffusion models to generate precise instance edge maps. Unlike DINO-based UIS methods, diffusion models inherently capture fine-grained, instance-aware features, enabling more precise boundary delineation. For WPS, DiffEGG eliminates annotation costs and human bias by operating without any form of manual supervision, addressing the key limitations of prior best methods. Additionally, we introduce RIP, a post-processing technique that fuses DiffEGG's edge maps with segmentation masks in a task-agnostic manner. RIP allows DiffEGG to be seamlessly integrated into various segmentation frameworks. When applied to UIS, DiffEGG and RIP achieve an average $+4.4\text{ AP}$ improvement over prior best UIS methods. When combined with weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSS), DiffEGG enables WPS without instance annotations, outperforming prior best point-supervised WPS methods by $+1.7\text{ PQ}$. These results demonstrate that DiffEGG's edge maps serve as a cost-effective, annotation-free alternative to instance annotations, significantly improving segmentation without human intervention.

The core idea behind them is learning to reverse the process of gradually adding noise to images, allowing them to generate high-quality samples from a complex distribution. In this survey, we provide an exhaustive overview of existing methods using diffusion models for image editing, covering both theoretical and practical aspects in the field. We delve into a thorough analysis and categorization of these works from multiple perspectives, including learning strategies, user-input conditions, and the array of specific editing tasks that can be accomplished. In addition, we pay special attention to image inpainting and outpainting, and explore both earlier traditional context-driven and current multimodal conditional methods, offering a comprehensive analysis of their methodologies. To further evaluate the performance of text-guided image editing algorithms, we propose a systematic benchmark, EditEval, featuring an innovative metric, LMM Score. Finally, we address current limitations and envision some potential directions for future research.

| **[Can Generative Geospatial Diffusion Models Excel as Discriminative Geospatial Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07890v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily focus on discriminative objectives, such as contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models--which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation--remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional diffusions for neural posterior estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19105v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based computational approach for Bayesian inference, has shown great success in approximating complex posterior distributions. Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing flows, which approximate a distribution by composing many simple, invertible transformations. But flow-based models, while state of the art for NPE, are known to suffer from several limitations, including training instability and sharp trade-offs between representational power and computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions coupled with high-capacity summary networks for amortized NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods. Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models. Building on prior work on diffusions for NPE, we show that these gains persist across a variety of different summary network architectures.

The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that facilitates bidirectional information exchange between video and audio diffusion models through temporally-aligned self attention operations. Unlike prior work that uses dedicated models for A2V and V2A tasks and relies on pretrained feature extractors, AV-Link achieves both tasks in a single self-contained framework, directly leveraging features obtained by the complementary modality (i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video). Extensive automatic and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial improvement in audio-video synchronization, outperforming more expensive baselines such as the MovieGen video-to-audio model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: snap-research.github.io/AVLink/</p></details> |
| **[Denoising Score Distillation: From Noisy Diffusion Pretraining to One-Step High-Quality Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07578v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-resolution, realistic images across diverse natural distributions. However, their performance heavily relies on high-quality training data, making it challenging to learn meaningful distributions from corrupted samples. This limitation restricts their applicability in scientific domains where clean data is scarce or costly to obtain. In this work, we introduce denoising score distillation (DSD), a surprisingly effective and novel approach for training high-quality generative models from low-quality data. DSD first pretrains a diffusion model exclusively on noisy, corrupted samples and then distills it into a one-step generator capable of producing refined, clean outputs. While score distillation is traditionally viewed as a method to accelerate diffusion models, we show that it can also significantly enhance sample quality, particularly when starting from a degraded teacher model. Across varying noise levels and datasets, DSD consistently improves generative performancewe summarize our empirical evidence in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that, in a linear model setting, DSD identifies the eigenspace of the clean data distributions covariance matrix, implicitly regularizing the generator. This perspective reframes score distillation as not only a tool for efficiency but also a mechanism for improving generative models, particularly in low-quality data settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First Author and Second Author contributed equally to this work.

However, their slow generation speed remains a critical challenge. Existing acceleration methods, while aiming to reduce steps, often compromise sample quality, controllability, or introduce training complexities. Therefore, we propose RayFlow, a novel diffusion framework that addresses these limitations. Unlike previous methods, RayFlow guides each sample along a unique path towards an instance-specific target distribution. This method minimizes sampling steps while preserving generation diversity and stability. Furthermore, we introduce Time Sampler, an importance sampling technique to enhance training efficiency by focusing on crucial timesteps. Extensive experiments demonstrate RayFlow's superiority in generating high-quality images with improved speed, control, and training efficiency compared to existing acceleration techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[TriDi: Trilateral Diffusion of 3D Humans, Objects, and Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06334v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling 3D human-object interaction (HOI) is a problem of great interest for computer vision and a key enabler for virtual and mixed-reality applications. Existing methods work in a one-way direction: some recover plausible human interactions conditioned on a 3D object; others recover the object pose conditioned on a human pose. Instead, we provide the first unified model - TriDi which works in any direction. Concretely, we generate Human, Object, and Interaction modalities simultaneously with a new three-way diffusion process, allowing to model seven distributions with one network. We implement TriDi as a transformer attending to the various modalities' tokens, thereby discovering conditional relations between them. The user can control the interaction either as a text description of HOI or a contact map. We embed these two representations into a shared latent space, combining the practicality of text descriptions with the expressiveness of contact maps. Using a single network, TriDi unifies all the special cases of prior work and extends to new ones, modeling a family of seven distributions. Remarkably, despite using a single model, TriDi generated samples surpass one-way specialized baselines on GRAB and BEHAVE in terms of both qualitative and quantitative metrics, and demonstrating better diversity. We show the applicability of TriDi to scene population, generating objects for human-contact datasets, and generalization to unseen object geometry.

| **[DRESS: Diffusion Reasoning-based Reward Shaping Scheme For Intelligent Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07433v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network optimization remains fundamental in wireless communications, with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions gaining widespread adoption. As Sixth-Generation (6G) communication networks pursue full-scenario coverage, optimization in complex extreme environments presents unprecedented challenges. The dynamic nature of these environments, combined with physical constraints, makes it difficult for AI solutions such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to obtain effective reward feedback for the training process. However, many existing DRL-based network optimization studies overlook this challenge through idealized environment settings. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of Generative AI (GenAI), especially diffusion models, in capturing complex latent distributions, we introduce a novel Diffusion Reasoning-based Reward Shaping Scheme (DRESS) to achieve robust network optimization. By conditioning on observed environmental states and executed actions, DRESS leverages diffusion models' multi-step denoising process as a form of deep reasoning, progressively refining latent representations to generate meaningful auxiliary reward signals that capture patterns of network systems. Moreover, DRESS is designed for seamless integration with any DRL framework, allowing DRESS-aided DRL (DRESSed-DRL) to enable stable and efficient DRL training even under extreme network environments. Experimental results demonstrate that DRESSed-DRL achieves about 1.5x times faster convergence than its original version in sparse-reward wireless environments and significant performance improvements in multiple general DRL benchmark environments compared to baseline methods. The code of DRESS is available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/DRESS.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-Diffusion: Asynchronous Video Generation with Auto-Regressive Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07418v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of video generation requires synthesizing visually realistic and temporally coherent video frames. Existing methods primarily use asynchronous auto-regressive models or synchronous diffusion models to address this challenge. However, asynchronous auto-regressive models often suffer from inconsistencies between training and inference, leading to issues such as error accumulation, while synchronous diffusion models are limited by their reliance on rigid sequence length. To address these issues, we introduce Auto-Regressive Diffusion (AR-Diffusion), a novel model that combines the strengths of auto-regressive and diffusion models for flexible, asynchronous video generation. Specifically, our approach leverages diffusion to gradually corrupt video frames in both training and inference, reducing the discrepancy between these phases. Inspired by auto-regressive generation, we incorporate a non-decreasing constraint on the corruption timesteps of individual frames, ensuring that earlier frames remain clearer than subsequent ones. This setup, together with temporal causal attention, enables flexible generation of videos with varying lengths while preserving temporal coherence. In addition, we design two specialized timestep schedulers: the FoPP scheduler for balanced timestep sampling during training, and the AD scheduler for flexible timestep differences during inference, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves competitive and state-of-the-art results across four challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[TimeStep Master: Asymmetrical Mixture of Timestep LoRA Experts for Versatile and Efficient Diffusion Models in Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07416v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have driven the advancement of vision generation over the past years. However, it is often difficult to apply these large models in downstream tasks, due to massive fine-tuning cost. Recently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been applied for efficient tuning of diffusion models. Unfortunately, the capabilities of LoRA-tuned diffusion models are limited, since the same LoRA is used for different timesteps of the diffusion process. To tackle this problem, we introduce a general and concise TimeStep Master (TSM) paradigm with two key fine-tuning stages. In the fostering stage (1-stage), we apply different LoRAs to fine-tune the diffusion model at different timestep intervals. This results in different TimeStep LoRA experts that can effectively capture different noise levels. In the assembling stage (2-stage), we design a novel asymmetrical mixture of TimeStep LoRA experts, via core-context collaboration of experts at multi-scale intervals. For each timestep, we leverage TimeStep LoRA expert within the smallest interval as the core expert without gating, and use experts within the bigger intervals as the context experts with time-dependent gating. Consequently, our TSM can effectively model the noise level via the expert in the finest interval, and adaptively integrate contexts from the experts of other scales, boosting the versatility of diffusion models. To show the effectiveness of our TSM paradigm, we conduct extensive experiments on three typical and popular LoRA-related tasks of diffusion models, including domain adaptation, post-pretraining, and model distillation. Our TSM achieves the state-of-the-art results on all these tasks, throughout various model structures (UNet, DiT and MM-DiT) and visual data modalities (Image, Video), showing its remarkable generalization capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[SPEED: Scalable, Precise, and Efficient Concept Erasure for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07392v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Erasing concepts from large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has become increasingly crucial due to the growing concerns over copyright infringement, offensive content, and privacy violations. However, existing methods either require costly fine-tuning or degrade image quality for non-target concepts (i.e., prior) due to inherent optimization limitations. In this paper, we introduce SPEED, a model editing-based concept erasure approach that leverages null-space constraints for scalable, precise, and efficient erasure. Specifically, SPEED incorporates Influence-based Prior Filtering (IPF) to retain the most affected non-target concepts during erasing, Directed Prior Augmentation (DPA) to expand prior coverage while maintaining semantic consistency, and Invariant Equality Constraints (IEC) to regularize model editing by explicitly preserving key invariants during the T2I generation process. Extensive evaluations across multiple concept erasure tasks demonstrate that SPEED consistently outperforms existing methods in prior preservation while achieving efficient and high-fidelity concept erasure, successfully removing 100 concepts within just 5 seconds.

| **[TRCE: Towards Reliable Malicious Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07389v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable photorealistic image generation, but they also risk producing malicious content, such as NSFW images. To mitigate risk, concept erasure methods are studied to facilitate the model to unlearn specific concepts. However, current studies struggle to fully erase malicious concepts implicitly embedded in prompts (e.g., metaphorical expressions or adversarial prompts) while preserving the model's normal generation capability. To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE, using a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off between reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by erasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By identifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we optimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually similar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being overly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process. Following this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling trajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising prediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through contrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious content. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple malicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's original generation ability. The code is available at: http://github.com/ddgoodgood/TRCE. CAUTION: This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive material.</p></details> |  |

Existing works in this field aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn via memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for trustworthy application of GenAI. Existing works revealed that conditional DPMs are more prone to memorize training data than unconditional DPMs. And most data extraction methods developed so far target conditional DPMs. Although unconditional DPMs are less prone to data extraction, further investigation into these attacks remains essential since they serve as the foundation for conditional models like Stable Diffusion, and exploring these attacks will enhance our understanding of memorization in DPMs. In this work, we propose a novel data extraction method named \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a time-dependent classifier trained on generated data as surrogate conditions to extract training data from unconditional DPMs. Empirical results demonstrate that it can extract training data in challenging scenarios where previous methods fail, and it is, on average, over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical understanding of memorization in both conditional and unconditional DPMs and why SIDE is effective.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we introduce AttenST, a training-free attention-driven style transfer framework. Specifically, we propose a style-guided self-attention mechanism that conditions self-attention on the reference style by retaining the query of the content image while substituting its key and value with those from the style image, enabling effective style feature integration. To mitigate style information loss during inversion, we introduce a style-preserving inversion strategy that refines inversion accuracy through multiple resampling steps. Additionally, we propose a content-aware adaptive instance normalization, which integrates content statistics into the normalization process to optimize style fusion while mitigating the content degradation. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-feature cross-attention mechanism to fuse content and style features, ensuring a harmonious synthesis of structural fidelity and stylistic expression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AttenST outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in style transfer dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies reveal an optimization dilemma in this two-stage design: while increasing the per-token feature dimension in visual tokenizers improves reconstruction quality, it requires substantially larger diffusion models and more training iterations to achieve comparable generation performance. Consequently, existing systems often settle for sub-optimal solutions, either producing visual artifacts due to information loss within tokenizers or failing to converge fully due to expensive computation costs. We argue that this dilemma stems from the inherent difficulty in learning unconstrained high-dimensional latent spaces. To address this, we propose aligning the latent space with pre-trained vision foundation models when training the visual tokenizers. Our proposed VA-VAE (Vision foundation model Aligned Variational AutoEncoder) significantly expands the reconstruction-generation frontier of latent diffusion models, enabling faster convergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) in high-dimensional latent spaces. To exploit the full potential of VA-VAE, we build an enhanced DiT baseline with improved training strategies and architecture designs, termed LightningDiT. The integrated system achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on ImageNet 256x256 generation with an FID score of 1.35 while demonstrating remarkable training efficiency by reaching an FID score of 2.11 in just 64 epochs--representing an over 21 times convergence speedup compared to the original DiT.

While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have driven progress in generic image and video synthesis, the domain of controllable VFX generation remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for animated VFX generation as image animation, where dynamic effects are generated from user-friendly textual descriptions and static reference images. Our work makes two primary contributions: (i) Open-VFX, the first high-quality VFX video dataset spanning 15 diverse effect categories, annotated with textual descriptions, instance segmentation masks for spatial conditioning, and start-end timestamps for temporal control. (ii) VFX Creator, a simple yet effective controllable VFX generation framework based on a Video Diffusion Transformer. The model incorporates a spatial and temporal controllable LoRA adapter, requiring minimal training videos. Specifically, a plug-and-play mask control module enables instance-level spatial manipulation, while tokenized start-end motion timestamps embedded in the diffusion process, alongside the text encoder, allow precise temporal control over effect timing and pace. Extensive experiments on the Open-VFX test set demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in generating realistic and dynamic effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance and generalization ability in both spatial and temporal controllability. Furthermore, we introduce a specialized metric to evaluate the precision of temporal control. By bridging traditional VFX techniques with generative approaches, VFX Creator unlocks new possibilities for efficient and high-quality video effect generation, making advanced VFX accessible to a broader audience.</p></details> |  |
