| **[RACCooN: A Versatile Instructional Video Editing Framework with Auto-Generated Narratives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18406v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generative models primarily rely on carefully written text prompts for specific tasks, like inpainting or style editing. They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. (3) RACCooN also plans to imagine new objects in a given video, so users simply prompt the model to receive a detailed video editing plan for complex video editing. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 main; The first two authors contribute equally.

| **[Mask2IV: Interaction-Centric Video Generation via Mask Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03135v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://reagan1311.github.io/mask2iv</p></details> |
| **[Pack and Force Your Memory: Long-form and Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01784v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing the practical usability of autoregressive video models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Text-to-Sounding Video Generation via Advanced Modality Condition and Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03117v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task, Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer, which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust ``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information, achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions, offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Drives Compositional Generalization in Visual Generative Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03075v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i) whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like MaskGIT.</p></details> |  |
| **[When and Where do Events Switch in Multi-Event Video Generation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03049v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event conditioning in future models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in Progress.

| **[Photography Perspective Composition: Towards Aesthetic Perspective Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20655v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional photography composition approaches are dominated by 2D cropping-based methods. However, these methods fall short when scenes contain poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that demonstrates the transformation process from less favorable to aesthetically enhanced perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users to enhance their composition skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Defenses against AI-generated Visual Media: Detection, Disruption, and Authentication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10575v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models have demonstrated impressive performance in various computer vision applications, including image synthesis, video generation, and medical analysis. Despite their significant advancements, these models may be used for malicious purposes, such as misinformation, deception, and copyright violation. In this paper, we provide a systematic and timely review of research efforts on defenses against AI-generated visual media, covering detection, disruption, and authentication. We review existing methods and summarize the mainstream defense-related tasks within a unified passive and proactive framework. Moreover, we survey the derivative tasks concerning the trustworthiness of defenses, such as their robustness and fairness. For each task, we formulate its general pipeline and propose a taxonomy based on methodological strategies that are uniformly applicable to the primary subtasks. Additionally, we summarize the commonly used evaluation datasets, criteria, and metrics. Finally, by analyzing the reviewed studies, we provide insights into current research challenges and suggest possible directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> |
| **[Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However, existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model. Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss, our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://beijia11.github.io/IASA</p></details> |
| **[How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities, spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate, producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns. To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring Dynamic Physical Properties from Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02311v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid, and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiModal Action Conditioned Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02287v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control. General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Generate Object Interactions with Physics-Guided Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02284v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however, current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore, KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Forcing++: Towards Minute-Scale High-Quality Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02283v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos. Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to 20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/</p></details> | preprint |
| **[TempoControl: Temporal Attention Guidance for Text-to-Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02226v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications, including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as action and audio-aligned generation.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Multi-marginal temporal Schrödinger Bridge Matching for video generation from unpaired data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01894v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

| **[VideoGen-of-Thought: Step-by-step generating multi-shot video with minimal manual intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02259v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video generation models excel at short clips but fail to produce cohesive multi-shot narratives due to disjointed visual dynamics and fractured storylines. Existing solutions either rely on extensive manual scripting/editing or prioritize single-shot fidelity over cross-scene continuity, limiting their practicality for movie-like content. We introduce VideoGen-of-Thought (VGoT), a step-by-step framework that automates multi-shot video synthesis from a single sentence by systematically addressing three core challenges: (1) Narrative fragmentation: Existing methods lack structured storytelling. We propose dynamic storyline modeling, which turns the user prompt into concise shot drafts and then expands them into detailed specifications across five domains (character dynamics, background continuity, relationship evolution, camera movements, and HDR lighting) with self-validation to ensure logical progress. (2) Visual inconsistency: previous approaches struggle to maintain consistent appearance across shots. Our identity-aware cross-shot propagation builds identity-preserving portrait (IPP) tokens that keep character identity while allowing controlled trait changes (expressions, aging) required by the story. (3) Transition artifacts: Abrupt shot changes disrupt immersion. Our adjacent latent transition mechanisms implement boundary-aware reset strategies that process adjacent shots' features at transition points, enabling seamless visual flow while preserving narrative continuity. Combined in a training-free pipeline, VGoT surpasses strong baselines by 20.4\% in within-shot face consistency and 17.4\% in style consistency, while requiring 10x fewer manual adjustments. VGoT bridges the gap between raw visual synthesis and director-level storytelling for automated multi-shot video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/DuNGEOnmassster/VideoGen-of-Thought.git; Webpage: https://cheliosoops.github.io/VGoT/</p></details> |
| **[AniMaker: Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10540v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Adversarial Post-Training for One-Step Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08316v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation, but their iterative generation process is slow and expansive. While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Autoregressive Adversarial Post-Training for Real-Time Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09350v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

| **[IMAGEdit: Let Any Subject Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01186v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models' understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects, thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/XWH-A/IMAGEdit.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this mental process, we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration. Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/JiahaoPlus/EvoWorld</p></details> |
| **[Code2Video: A Code-centric Paradigm for Educational Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01174v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions, limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g., code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency; and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced, discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos. Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials.

| **[SpargeAttention: Accurate and Training-free Sparse Attention Accelerating Any Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18137v7)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrices $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrices $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK^\top$. Third, we propose a two-level accumulation strategy for $\widetilde PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 4.5x on RTX4090, respectively. Moreover, SageAttention2 matches the speed of FlashAttention3(fp8) on the Hopper GPUs, while delivering much higher accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for language, image, and video generation.

As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of $O(N^2)$, compared to $O(N)$ for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3.

Second, these trajectories guide video generation through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of 545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning approaches, including image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images, achieving superior colorization performance.

| **[Arbitrary Generative Video Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00578v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity.

While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension -- whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e., spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s. real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest). By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://deeptracereward.github.io/</p></details> |

However, the power of AE has long been underexplored in terms of network design, compression ratio, and training strategy. In this work, we systematically examine the architecture design choices and optimize the computation distribution to obtain a series of efficient and high-compression video AEs that can decode in real time even on mobile devices. We also propose an omni-training objective to unify the design of plain Autoencoder and image-conditioned I2V VAE, achieving multifunctionality in a single VAE network but with enhanced quality. In addition, we propose a novel latent consistency loss that provides stable improvements in reconstruction quality. Latent consistency loss outperforms prior auxiliary losses including LPIPS, GAN and DWT in terms of both quality improvements and simplicity. H3AE achieves ultra-high compression ratios and real-time decoding speed on GPU and mobile, and outperforms prior arts in terms of reconstruction metrics by a large margin. We finally validate our AE by training a DiT on its latent space and demonstrate fast, high-quality text-to-video generation capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, such models require a significant number of function evaluations (NFEs) during sampling, leading to costly inference. Consequently, quality-preserving fast sampling methods that require fewer NFEs have been an active area of research. However, prior training-free sampling methods fail to simultaneously address two key challenges: the stiffness of the ODE (i.e., the non-straightness of the velocity field) and dependence on the semi-linear structure of the DM ODE (which limits their direct applicability to flow-matching models). In this work, we introduce the Stabilized Taylor Orthogonal Runge--Kutta (STORK) method, addressing both design concerns. We demonstrate that STORK consistently improves the quality of diffusion and flow-matching sampling for image and video generation.

However, existing video generation models still fall short in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming existing open-source and commercial models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Ovi, a unified paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules, Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate, context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips.

However, existing models and benchmarks fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera. Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+ models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture; (iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of realistic motion dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling.

| **[PatchVSR: Breaking Video Diffusion Resolution Limits with Patch-wise Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26025v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR. This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512 resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 13 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |

While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact, motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied planning.

We propose a world-model-based policy evaluation environment (WorldGym), an autoregressive, action-conditioned video generation model which serves as a proxy to real world environments. Policies are evaluated via Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model, with a vision-language model providing rewards. We evaluate a set of VLA-based real-robot policies in the world model using only initial frames from real robots, and show that policy success rates within the world model highly correlate with real-world success rates. Moreoever, we show that WorldGym is able to preserve relative policy rankings across different policy versions, sizes, and training checkpoints. Due to requiring only a single start frame as input, the world model further enables efficient evaluation of robot policies' generalization ability on novel tasks and environments. We find that modern VLA-based robot policies still struggle to distinguish object shapes and can become distracted by adversarial facades of objects. While generating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging, WorldGym faithfully emulates robot motions and offers a practical starting point for safe and reproducible policy evaluation before deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-model-eval.github.io</p></details> |

Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains, but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity. Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88 PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$} reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end inference.

Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality.

| **[FlashI2V: Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting Prevents Conditional Image Leakage in Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25187v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance. We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V, surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P.

DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii) AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100 GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than their base counterparts without compromising quality, and further enable 2160x3840 video generation on a single GPU.

However, most existing work suffers from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second, we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU, with substantially reduced error accumulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kunhao-liu.github.io/Rolling_Forcing_Webpage/</p></details> |

While prior works have advanced the field, they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents. To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories. Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: \url{https://yuyangyin.github.io/PanoWorld-X/}</p></details> |

While recent works such as Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization, their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD. Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm, built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step and features fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B, and our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

| **[Attention Surgery: An Efficient Recipe to Linearize Your Video Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24899v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for \textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models, our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers. Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models, reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[BranchGRPO: Stable and Efficient GRPO with Structured Branching in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06040v5)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in aligning image and video generative models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has improved human preference alignment, but existing variants remain inefficient due to sequential rollouts and large numbers of sampling steps, unreliable credit assignment: sparse terminal rewards are uniformly propagated across timesteps, failing to capture the varying criticality of decisions during denoising. In this paper, we present BranchGRPO, a method that restructures the rollout process into a branching tree, where shared prefixes amortize computation and pruning removes low-value paths and redundant depths. BranchGRPO introduces three contributions: (1) a branching scheme that amortizes rollout cost through shared prefixes while preserving exploration diversity; (2) a reward fusion and depth-wise advantage estimator that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense step-level signals; and (3) pruning strategies that cut gradient computation but leave forward rollouts and exploration unaffected. On HPDv2.1 image alignment, BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by up to \textbf{16\%} over DanceGRPO, while reducing per-iteration training time by nearly \textbf{55\%}. A hybrid variant, BranchGRPO-Mix, further accelerates training to 4.7x faster than DanceGRPO without degrading alignment. On WanX video generation, it further achieves higher Video-Align scores with sharper and temporally consistent frames compared to DanceGRPO.

| **[Enhancing Physical Plausibility in Video Generation by Reasoning the Implausibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24702v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets, which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it. Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising. Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism, despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.</p></details> |  |

SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Yet leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity. We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments diffusion models with a register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and controllable image generation. We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision. Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative, scientific, and practical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, overlap with arXiv:2507.20855 and arXiv:2501.15878</p></details> |

Recent video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals, and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset, ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic. ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on our website.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,Project website: https://ctrlhair-arxiv.netlify.app/</p></details> |

Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.</p></details> |  |

Image-to-Video (I2V) generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However, existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the field.</p></details> |  |

However, these attributions also hinder the practical deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application. Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search. We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup.

The generated weights can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode. 2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights. In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between frames or videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://nerv-diffusion.github.io/</p></details> |

We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation. Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second, action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, accepted to CoRL 2025 LSRW workshop</p></details> |

Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://amap-ml.github.io/NarrLV-Website/</p></details> |

We question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes. Among these designs, we find model video generation using \textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously. This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in video and other spatiotemporal domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLA: Beyond Sparsity in Diffusion Transformers via Fine-Tunable Sparse-Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24006v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation, attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N) attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality, outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a 2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.</p></details> |  |

Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates, causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to existing tokenizers. The code and weights are released at: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VFRTok.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

After pre-training on enormous data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation, respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a Half-Order (HO) fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The HO gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with lower variance than other methods. We theoretically investigate the bias, variance, and convergence of our method. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimpleGVR: A Simple Baseline for Latent-Cascaded Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19838v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency, we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering practical resources for the research community.</p></details> |  |

While numerous models have explored audio and video editing, they struggle with object-level audio-visual operations. Specifically, object-level audio-visual editing requires the ability to perform object addition, replacement, and removal across both audio and visual modalities, while preserving the structural information of the source instances during the editing process. In this paper, we present \textbf{Object-AVEdit}, achieving the object-level audio-visual editing based on the inversion-regeneration paradigm. To achieve the object-level controllability during editing, we develop a word-to-sounding-object well-aligned audio generation model, bridging the gap in object-controllability between audio and current video generation models. Meanwhile, to achieve the better structural information preservation and object-level editing effect, we propose an inversion-regeneration holistically-optimized editing algorithm, ensuring both information retention during the inversion and better regeneration effect. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our editing model achieved advanced results in both audio-video object-level editing tasks with fine audio-visual semantic alignment. In addition, our developed audio generation model also achieved advanced performance. More results on our project page: https://gewu-lab.github.io/Object_AVEdit-website/.</p></details> |  |

However, a crucial dimension of storytelling -- character-driven dialogue and speech -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that transforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative dialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character expression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the first defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior. While a story generation model such as Text2Story produces the corresponding visual scene, we focus on generating expressive, character-consistent utterances grounded in both the prompts and the scene image. A pretrained vision-language encoder extracts high-level semantic features from a representative frame, capturing salient visual context. These features are then integrated with structured prompts to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural dialogue. To ensure contextual and emotional consistency across scenes, we introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank -- a speaker-aware, temporally structured memory that recursively accumulates each character's dialogue history. Inspired by Script Theory in cognitive psychology, this design enables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals, social context, and narrative roles throughout the story. Finally, we render each utterance as expressive, character-conditioned speech, resulting in fully-voiced, multimodal video narratives. Our training-free framework generalizes across diverse story settings -- from fantasy adventures to slice-of-life episodes -- offering a scalable solution for coherent, character-grounded audiovisual storytelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures; revised supplementary document, etc</p></details> |

While prior defenses such as I2VGuard attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against misuse of I2V generation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at ICASSP 26 4 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3\text{B}\sim14\text{B}$, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code will be released upon acceptance</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures. Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications. As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual human animation, and immersive entertainment.</p></details> |  |

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |

Text-to-3D models produce detailed static geometry but lack motion synthesis, while video diffusion models generate motion with temporal and multi-view geometric inconsistencies. T2Bs bridges this gap by leveraging deformable 3D Gaussian splatting to align static 3D assets with video outputs. By constraining motion with static geometry and employing a view-dependent deformation MLP, T2Bs (i) outperforms existing 4D generation methods in accuracy and expressiveness while reducing video artifacts and view inconsistencies, and (ii) reconstructs smooth, coherent, fully registered 3D geometries designed to scale for building morphable models with diverse, realistic facial motions. This enables synthesizing expressive, animatable character heads that surpass current 4D generation techniques.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluators and reward models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168 human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc), while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for Best-of-N sampling.

| **[LongLive: Real-time Interactive Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22622v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity, especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long); and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation. With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains 20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal quality loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, model, and demos are available at https://github.com/NVlabs/LongLive</p></details> |

To address this issue, we present **EgoDemoGen**, a framework that generates *paired* novel egocentric demonstrations by retargeting actions in the novel egocentric frame and synthesizing the corresponding egocentric observation videos with proposed generative video repair model **EgoViewTransfer**, which is conditioned by a novel-viewpoint reprojected scene video and a robot-only video rendered from the retargeted joint actions. EgoViewTransfer is finetuned from a pretrained video generation model using self-supervised double reprojection strategy. We evaluate EgoDemoGen on both simulation (RoboTwin2.0) and real-world robot. After training with a mixture of EgoDemoGen-generated novel egocentric demonstrations and original standard egocentric demonstrations, policy success rate improves **absolutely** by **+17.0%** for standard egocentric viewpoint and by **+17.7%** for novel egocentric viewpoints in simulation. On real-world robot, the **absolute** improvements are **+18.3%** and **+25.8%**. Moreover, performance continues to improve as the proportion of EgoDemoGen-generated demonstrations increases, with diminishing returns. These results demonstrate that EgoDemoGen provides a practical route to egocentric viewpoint-robust robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting large-scale real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation (EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent, geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground, background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a 200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in boosting policy generalization.</p></details> |  |

While studies propose acceleration methods to reduce workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting their applicability. We introduce Astraea, a framework that searches for near-optimal configurations for vDiT-based video generation under a performance target. At its core, Astraea proposes a lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-friendly sparse attention strategy, enabling linear savings on execution time with minimal impact on generation quality. Meanwhile, to determine optimal token reduction for different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of the token budget effectively. Together, Astraea achieves up to 2.4$\times$ inference speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2$\times$ speedup on 8 GPUs) while achieving up to over 10~dB video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods ($<$0.5\% loss on VBench compared to baselines).</p></details> |  |

While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) dependence on computation-heavy and inflexible calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) Bounded-init Grid Refinement (BGR) and (2) Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization error reduction, as well as (3) $\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS) for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately 2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on advanced DiT models while maintaining visual fidelity.

Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, which potentially limits their ability and application scope. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which can significantly improve the quality of the generated image by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. The biggest difference from existing guidance is that SG only relies on the sampling score function of the original diffusion or flow model at different noise levels, with no need for any tricky and expensive guidance-specific training. This makes SG highly flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner by any diffusion or flow models. We also introduce an efficient variant of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid additional forward passes of the diffusion network.We conduct extensive experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG, with 50 percent more efficiency. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability to eliminate human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We have released our code at https://github.com/maple-research-lab/Self-Guidance.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

In content creation workflows, precise and simultaneous control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction enhances both accuracy and flexibility. However, existing approaches typically treat these control signals separately, largely due to the scarcity of datasets with high-quality joint annotations and mismatched control spaces across modalities. We present VidCRAFT3, a unified and flexible I2V framework that supports both independent and joint control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction by integrating three core components. Image2Cloud reconstructs a 3D point cloud from the reference image to enable precise camera motion control. ObjMotionNet encodes sparse object trajectories into multi-scale optical flow features to guide object motion. The Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer integrates lighting direction embeddings via parallel cross-attention. To address the scarcity of jointly annotated data, we curate the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset of synthetic static-scene video clips with per-frame lighting-direction labels, and adopt a three-stage training strategy that enables robust learning without fully joint annotations. Extensive experiments show that VidCRAFT3 outperforms existing methods in control precision and visual coherence. Code and data will be released.

In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion, making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation. However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution, 24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization accuracy and visual quality.

However, current video generation methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided, variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete, coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation, guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent long-horizon generation over extended rollouts.

Inspired by this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.</p></details> |  |

Despite the established strong imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception, outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art video diffusion models frequently produce implausible results such as momentum violations and object interpenetrations. Existing physics-aware approaches often rely on task-specific fine-tuning or supervised data, which limits their scalability and applicability. To address the challenge, we present PhyMAGIC, a training-free framework that generates physically consistent motion from a single image. PhyMAGIC integrates a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model, confidence-guided reasoning via LLMs, and a differentiable physics simulator to produce 3D assets ready for downstream physical simulation without fine-tuning or manual supervision. By iteratively refining motion prompts using LLM-derived confidence scores and leveraging simulation feedback, PhyMAGIC steers generation toward physically consistent dynamics.

While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore, we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.</p></details> |  |

Anticipating Future Motion by Generating Point Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21592v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e., predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a frequency-domain physics prior that improves motion plausibility without modifying model architectures. Our method decomposes common rigid motions (translation, rotation, scaling) into lightweight spectral losses, requiring only 2.7% of frequency coefficients while preserving 97%+ of spectral energy. Applied to Open-Sora, MVDIT, and Hunyuan, our approach improves both motion accuracy and action recognition by ~11% on average on OpenVID-1M (relative), while maintaining visual quality. User studies show 74--83% preference for our physics-enhanced videos. It also reduces warping error by 22--37% (depending on the backbone) and improves temporal consistency scores. These results indicate that simple, global spectral cues are an effective drop-in regularizer for physically plausible motion in video diffusion.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis with precise parameter control.</p></details> | <details><summary>All d...</summary><p>All data and code is available at https://github.com/pandayuanyu/NewtonGen</p></details> |

Existing approaches often attempt to learn these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.</p></details> | ICME2025 |

In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</p></details> |  |

Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods only produce partial scenes and provide limited navigational freedom. We introduce a practical and scalable solution that uses 360{\deg} video as an intermediate scene representation, capturing the full-scene context and ensuring consistent visual content throughout the generation. We propose WorldPrompter, a generative pipeline that synthesizes traversable 3D scenes from text prompts. WorldPrompter incorporates a conditional 360{\deg} panoramic video generator, capable of producing a 128-frame video that simulates a person walking through and capturing a virtual environment. The resulting video is then reconstructed as Gaussian splats by a fast feedforward 3D reconstructor, enabling a true walkable experience within the 3D scene. Experiments demonstrate that our panoramic video generation model, trained with a mix of image and video data, achieves convincing spatial and temporal consistency for static scenes. This is validated by an average COLMAP matching rate of 94.6\%, allowing for high-quality panoramic Gaussian splat reconstruction and improved navigation throughout the scene. Qualitative and quantitative results also show it outperforms the state-of-the-art 360{\deg} video generators and 3D scene generation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2025.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic, sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic, physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

| **[4D Driving Scene Generation With Stereo Forcing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20251v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising. This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance in downstream evaluations.

However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://yangzhou24.github.io/OmniWorld/</p></details> |

While there are some theoretical and primary empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space, leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.</p></details> | 27 pages |

We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that, in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator. On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces, identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes. These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision, outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided Versatile Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03122v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision. However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03110v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete, a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information, and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Latent Diffusion Unlearning: Protecting Against Unauthorized Personalization Through Trajectory Shifted Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03089v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication, the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$ on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily address single-person activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137 fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions for this new task. Benchmarking existing action segmentation methods on RHAS133 using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF, leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse evaluation settings.

| **[Learning Robust Diffusion Models from Imprecise Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03016v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs. Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels, will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D-CovDiffusion: 3D-Aware Diffusion Policy for Coverage Path Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03011v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, as a class of deep generative models, have recently emerged as powerful tools for robot skills by enabling stable training with reliable convergence. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating long, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across various industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray coating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their predefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they can represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks. Moreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or extensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations highlight the need for more expressive generative models, making diffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation. By iteratively denoising trajectories with carefully learned noise schedules and conditioning mechanisms, diffusion models not only ensure smooth and consistent motion but also flexibly adapt to the task context. In experiments, our method improves trajectory continuity, maintains high coverage, and generalizes to unseen shapes, paving the way for unified end-to-end trajectory learning across industrial surface-processing tasks without category-specific models. On average, our approach improves Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2\% and smoothness by 97.0\%, while increasing surface coverage by 61\% compared to prior methods.

| **[On diffusion posterior sampling via sequential Monte Carlo for zero-shot scaffolding of protein motifs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05788v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of diffusion models, new proteins can be generated at an unprecedented rate. The motif scaffolding problem requires steering this generative process to yield proteins with a desirable functional substructure called a motif. While models have been trained to take the motif as conditional input, recent techniques in diffusion posterior sampling can be leveraged as zero-shot alternatives whose approximations can be corrected with sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. In this work, we introduce a new set of guidance potentials for describing scaffolding tasks and solve them by adapting SMC-aided diffusion posterior samplers with an unconditional model, Genie, as a prior. In single motif problems, we find that (i) the proposed potentials perform comparably, if not better, than the conventional masking approach, (ii) samplers based on reconstruction guidance outperform their replacement method counterparts, and (iii) measurement tilted proposals and twisted targets improve performance substantially. Furthermore, as a demonstration, we provide solutions to two multi-motif problems by pairing reconstruction guidance with an SE(3)-invariant potential. We also produce designable internally symmetric monomers with a guidance potential for point symmetry constraints.

This allows us to generalize SGMs to the infinite-dimensional setting. Moreover, we extend existing finite-dimensional entropic convergence bounds to this Hilbertian setting by highlighting the role played by the Cameron-Martin norm in the Fisher information of the data distribution.

Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves 92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods. DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-aided Task-oriented Semantic Communications with Model Inversion Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19886v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication enhances transmission efficiency by conveying semantic information rather than raw input symbol sequences. Task-oriented semantic communication is a variant that tries to retains only task-specific information, thus achieving greater bandwidth savings. However, these neural-based communication systems are vulnerable to model inversion attacks, where adversaries try to infer sensitive input information from eavesdropped transmitted data. The key challenge, therefore, lies in preserving privacy while ensuring transmission correctness and robustness. While prior studies typically assume that adversaries aim to fully reconstruct the raw input in task-oriented settings, there exist scenarios where pixel-level metrics such as PSNR or SSIM are low, yet the adversary's outputs still suffice to accomplish the downstream task, indicating leakage of sensitive information. We therefore adopt the attacker's task accuracy as a more appropriate metric for evaluating attack effectiveness. To optimize the gap between the legitimate receiver's accuracy and the adversary's accuracy, we propose DiffSem, a diffusion-aided framework for task-oriented semantic communication. DiffSem integrates a transmitter-side self-noising mechanism that adaptively regulates semantic content while compensating for channel noise, and a receiver-side diffusion U-Net that enhances task performance and can be optionally strengthened by self-referential label embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that DiffSem enables the legitimate receiver to achieve higher accuracy, thereby validating the superior performance of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This task has gained increasing attention due to its wide range of applications, such as film production, dubbing, and virtual avatars. Despite recent progress, existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech intelligibility, audio-video synchronization, speech naturalness, and voice similarity to the reference speaker. To address these challenges, we propose AlignDiT, a multimodal Aligned Diffusion Transformer that generates accurate, synchronized, and natural-sounding speech from aligned multimodal inputs. Built upon the in-context learning capability of the DiT architecture, AlignDiT explores three effective strategies to align multimodal representations. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal classifier-free guidance mechanism that allows the model to adaptively balance information from each modality during speech synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignDiT significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks in terms of quality, synchronization, and speaker similarity. Moreover, AlignDiT exhibits strong generalization capability across various multimodal tasks, such as video-to-speech synthesis and visual forced alignment, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.

In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs, which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first practical way for discretized visual diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/martian422/MaskGRPO</p></details> |

These pipelines typically follow an encode--diffuse--decode three-stage architecture. Current serving systems deploy diffusion pipelines within a static, manual, and pipeline-level paradigm, allocating the same resources to every request and stage. However, through an in-depth analysis, we find that such a paradigm is inefficient due to the discrepancy in resource needs across the three stages of each request, as well as across different requests. Following the analysis, we propose the dynamic stage-level serving paradigm and develop TridentServe, a brand new diffusion serving system. TridentServe automatically, dynamically derives the placement plan (i.e., how each stage resides) for pipeline deployment and the dispatch plan (i.e., how the requests are routed) for request processing, co-optimizing the resource allocation for both model and requests. Extensive experiments show that TridentServe consistently improves SLO attainment and reduces average/P95 latencies by up to 2.5x and 3.6x/4.1x over existing works across a variety of workloads.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale Autoregressive Models are Laplacian, Discrete, and Latent Diffusion Models in Disguise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02826v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space, casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.</p></details> |  |

Our method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91% MAE reduction on Pendulum for accurate attribute control and 87% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 26 figures |
| **[DiffusionBlocks: Block-wise Neural Network Training via Diffusion Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14202v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end backpropagation requires storing activations throughout all layers, creating memory bottlenecks that limit model scalability. Existing block-wise training methods offer means to alleviate this problem, but they rely on ad-hoc local objectives and remain largely unexplored beyond classification tasks. We propose $\textit{DiffusionBlocks}$, a principled framework for transforming transformer-based networks into genuinely independent trainable blocks that maintain competitive performance with end-to-end training. Our key insight leverages the fact that residual connections naturally correspond to updates in a dynamical system. With minimal modifications to this system, we can convert the updates to those of a denoising process, where each block can be learned independently by leveraging the score matching objective. This independence enables training with gradients for only one block at a time, thereby reducing memory requirements in proportion to the number of blocks. Our experiments on a range of transformer architectures (vision, diffusion, autoregressive, recurrent-depth, and masked diffusion) demonstrate that DiffusionBlocks training matches the performance of end-to-end training while enabling scalable block-wise training on practical tasks beyond small-scale classification. DiffusionBlocks provides a theoretically grounded approach that successfully scales to modern generative tasks across diverse architectures.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Filter-Guided Diffusion for Controllable Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17141v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have shown incredible promise for zero shot image-to-image translation and editing. Most of these approaches work by combining or replacing network-specific features used in the generation of new images with those taken from the inversion of some guide image. Methods of this type are considered the current state-of-the-art in training-free approaches, but have some notable limitations: they tend to be costly in runtime and memory, and often depend on deterministic sampling that limits variation in generated results. We propose Filter-Guided Diffusion (FGD), an alternative approach that leverages fast filtering operations during the diffusion process to support finer control over the strength and frequencies of guidance and can work with non-deterministic samplers to produce greater variety. With its efficiency, FGD can be sampled over multiple seeds and hyperparameters in less time than a single run of other SOTA methods to produce superior results based on structural and semantic metrics. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments to evaluate the performance of FGD in translation tasks and also demonstrate its potential in localized editing when used with masks.

| **[UniVerse: Unleashing the Scene Prior of Video Diffusion Models for Robust Radiance Field Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01669v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D scene representations. However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations for robustly optimizing model parameters. To address this issue, we propose to decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process. To this end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D scenes from these restored images. Compared with case-by-case per-view degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style of the reconstructed 3D scene.

| **[Fine-Tuning Diffusion Models via Intermediate Distribution Shaping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02692v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExGS: Extreme 3D Gaussian Compression with Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24758v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering quality.We introduce ExGS, a novel feed-forward framework that unifies Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) with GaussPainter for Extreme 3DGS compression. UGC performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas GaussPainter leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in degraded renderings.To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can even achieve over 100X compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and high-quality neural rendering.Our code repository will be released at: https://github.com/chenttt2001/ExGS</p></details> |  |

The DDM employs a phase-field function to extend the original parabolic problem to a similar but slightly modified problem defined over a larger rectangular domain that contains the target physical domain. Based on the weighted Sobolev spaces, we rigorously establish the convergence of the diffuse domain solution to the original solution as the interface thickness parameter goes to zero, together with the corresponding optimal error estimates under the weighted $L^2$ and $H^1$ norms. Numerical experiments are also presented to validate the theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Action Diffusion for Cross-Embodiment Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14608v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end learning is emerging as a powerful paradigm for robotic manipulation, but its effectiveness is limited by data scarcity and the heterogeneity of action spaces across robot embodiments. In particular, diverse action spaces across different end-effectors create barriers for cross-embodiment learning and skill transfer. We address this challenge through diffusion policies learned in a latent action space that unifies diverse end-effector actions. We first show that we can learn a semantically aligned latent action space for anthropomorphic robotic hands, a human hand, and a parallel jaw gripper using encoders trained with a contrastive loss. Second, we show that by using our proposed latent action space for co-training on manipulation data from different end-effectors, we can utilize a single policy for multi-robot control and obtain up to 25.3% improved manipulation success rates, indicating successful skill transfer despite a significant embodiment gap. Our approach using latent cross-embodiment policies presents a new method to unify different action spaces across embodiments, enabling efficient multi-robot control and data sharing across robot setups. This unified representation significantly reduces the need for extensive data collection for each new robot morphology, accelerates generalization across embodiments, and ultimately facilitates more scalable and efficient robotic learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, website: https://mimicrobotics.github.io/lad/</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Parallel: Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models via Learnable Parallel Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25188v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires $\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work, we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position, whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction (EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop, and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt. The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally, PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt adaptation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Injecting Measurement Information Yields a Fast and Noise-Robust Diffusion-Based Inverse Problem Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02964v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample $\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler, resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across multiple datasets and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning for costate initialization using Markov chain Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02527v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global search and optimization of long-duration, low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with the indirect method is challenging due to a complex solution space and the difficulty of generating good initial guesses for the costate variables. This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that reveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible manner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related trajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion models to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions. We then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the aforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is employed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model using a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint violations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for separate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical experiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve sample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of Markov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa circular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a partial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior Pareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method for a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a separate dedicated global search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Linear Diffusions: Improved Representations for Rare Conditional Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02499v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks with widespread applications across machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. While current research has predominantly focused on linear diffusions, these approaches can face significant challenges when modeling a conditional distribution, $P(Y|X=x)$, when $P(X=x)$ is small. In these regions, few samples, if any, are available for training, thus modeling the corresponding conditional density may be difficult. Recognizing this, we show it is possible to adapt the data representation and forward scheme so that the sample complexity of learning a score-based generative model is small in low probability regions of the conditioning space. Drawing inspiration from conditional extreme value theory we characterize this method precisely in the special case in the tail regions of the conditioning variable, $X$. We show how diffusion with a data-driven choice of nonlinear drift term is best suited to model tail events under an appropriate representation of the data. Through empirical validation on two synthetic datasets and a real-world financial dataset, we demonstrate that our tail-adaptive approach significantly outperforms standard diffusion models in accurately capturing response distributions at the extreme tail conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models and the Manifold Hypothesis: Log-Domain Smoothing is Geometry Adaptive](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02305v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments, outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and processing time for continual personalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Anchoring for Discrete Diffusion Posterior Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02291v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and text-guided editing.</p></details> | Preprint |

Beyond their creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however, current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore, KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Recently, diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 4 figures.

We first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy. Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only, obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and planning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Semantic Selectivity of Latent Groups in Higher Visual Cortex with Mutual Information-Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02182v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how neural populations in higher visual areas encode object-centered visual information remains a central challenge in computational neuroscience. Prior works have investigated representational alignment between artificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings are indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations themselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features from neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations. This leaves open a scientific question: "how feature-specific visual information is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas, and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful subspaces." To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages the generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the visual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first uses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent subspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information (MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on multi-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of two macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual features, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and intra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our understanding of its encoding principles.</p></details> |  |

Despite the development of several methods to accelerate diffusion-based SR models, some (e.g., SinSR) fail to produce realistic perceptual details, while others (e.g., OSEDiff) may hallucinate non-existent structures. To overcome these issues, we present RSD, a new distillation method for ResShift, one of the top diffusion-based SR models. Our method is based on training the student network to produce such images that a new fake ResShift model trained on them will coincide with the teacher model. RSD achieves single-step restoration and outperforms the teacher by a large margin. We show that our distillation method can surpass the other distillation-based method for ResShift - SinSR - making it on par with state-of-the-art diffusion-based SR distillation methods. Compared to SR methods based on pre-trained text-to-image models, RSD produces competitive perceptual quality, provides images with better alignment to degraded input images, and requires fewer parameters and GPU memory. We provide experimental results on various real-world and synthetic datasets, including RealSR, RealSet65, DRealSR, ImageNet, and DIV2K.</p></details> |  |
| **[VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02086v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures. Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries. In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor details. This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines. Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiCache: Let Diffusion Model Determine Its Own Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17356v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine caching timings and adopting handcrafted rules for multi-step cache utilization. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail to cope with diverse samples. In this paper, a strong sample-specific correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of deep-layer features. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain an on-the-fly indicator for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to dynamically customize the caching schedule for each sample. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment adaptively approximates the deep-layer feature output from multi-step historical caches based on the shallow-layer feature trajectory, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved fidelity over state-of-the-art approaches on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo and Flux.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bujiazi.github.io/dicache.github.io/ Code: https://github.com/Bujiazi/DiCache</p></details> |
| **[Spec-Gloss Surfels and Normal-Diffuse Priors for Relightable Glossy Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02069v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to existing Gaussian splatting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Human Pose Estimation using Diffusion-based Inverse solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02043v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors. Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users, primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains the sparse on-body measurements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced DACER Algorithm with High Diffusion Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23426v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse diffusion process as a policy approximator, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, it still suffers from a core trade-off: more diffusion steps ensure high performance but reduce efficiency, while fewer steps degrade performance. This remains a major bottleneck for deploying diffusion policies in real-time online RL. To mitigate this, we propose DACERv2, which leverages a Q-gradient field objective with respect to action as an auxiliary optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step, thereby introducing intermediate supervisory signals that enhance the efficiency of single-step diffusion. Additionally, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the diffusion time step is inconsistent with the characteristics of the diffusion process. To address this issue, a temporal weighting mechanism is introduced, allowing the model to effectively eliminate large-scale noise during the early stages and refine its outputs in the later stages. Experimental results on OpenAI Gym benchmarks and multimodal tasks demonstrate that, compared with classical and diffusion-based online RL algorithms, DACERv2 achieves higher performance in most complex control environments with only five diffusion steps and shows greater multimodality.</p></details> |  |
| **[There and Back Again: On the relation between Noise and Image Inversions in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23530v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating new samples but lack a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the data into editable features. Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, transferring images to their approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image areas (e.g., plain sky). Through a series of analyses, we trace this issue to the first inversion steps, which fail to provide accurate and diverse noise. Consequently, the DDIM inversion space is notably less manipulative than the original noise. We show that prior inversion methods do not fully resolve this issue, but our simple fix, where we replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, successfully decorrelates latent encodings and enables higher quality editions and interpolations. The code is available at https://github.com/luk-st/taba.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Concept Unlearning by Modeling Key Steps of Diffusion Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06526v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion, which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely used, but their flexibility also makes them prone to misuse for producing harmful or unsafe content. Concept unlearning has been used to prevent text-to-image diffusion models from being misused to generate undesirable visual content. However, existing methods struggle to trade off unlearning effectiveness with the preservation of generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU), which selectively fine-tunes the model at key steps to the target concept. KSCU is inspired by the fact that different diffusion denoising steps contribute unequally to the final generation. Compared to previous approaches, which treat all denoising steps uniformly, KSCU avoids over-optimization of unnecessary steps for higher effectiveness and reduces the number of parameter updates for higher efficiency. For example, on the I2P dataset, KSCU outperforms ESD by 8.3% in nudity unlearning accuracy while improving FID by 8.4%, and achieves a high overall score of 0.92, substantially surpassing all other SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Diffusion Processes for Physically Interpretable Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00733v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards. We compare DeepFHT with Cox survival model using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena in complex systems.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification, leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii) Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and (iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on CUHK-SYSU and PRW.</p></details> |  |

While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

| **[Towards Photonic Band Diagram Generation with Transformer-Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01749v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photonic crystals enable fine control over light propagation at the nanoscale, and thus play a central role in the development of photonic and quantum technologies. Photonic band diagrams (BDs) are a key tool to investigate light propagation into such inhomogeneous structured materials. However, computing BDs requires solving Maxwell's equations across many configurations, making it numerically expensive, especially when embedded in optimization loops for inverse design techniques, for example. To address this challenge, we introduce the first approach for BD generation based on diffusion models, with the capacity to later generalize and scale to arbitrary three dimensional structures. Our method couples a transformer encoder, which extracts contextual embeddings from the input structure, with a latent diffusion model to generate the corresponding BD. In addition, we provide insights into why transformers and diffusion models are well suited to capture the complex interference and scattering phenomena inherent to photonics, paving the way for new surrogate modeling strategies in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[RIFLE: Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24644v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation. Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement, RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally, Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation. For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Model as a Noise-Aware Latent Reward Model for Step-Level Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01051v5)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference optimization for diffusion models aims to align them with human preferences for images. Previous methods typically use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as pixel-level reward models to approximate human preferences. However, when used for step-level preference optimization, these models face challenges in handling noisy images of different timesteps and require complex transformations into pixel space. In this work, we show that pre-trained diffusion models are naturally suited for step-level reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process latent images at various noise levels. Accordingly, we propose the Latent Reward Model (LRM), which repurposes components of the diffusion model to predict preferences of latent images at arbitrary timesteps. Building on LRM, we introduce Latent Preference Optimization (LPO), a step-level preference optimization method conducted directly in the noisy latent space. Experimental results indicate that LPO significantly improves the model's alignment with general, aesthetic, and text-image alignment preferences, while achieving a 2.5-28x training speedup over existing preference optimization methods. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/LPO.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, capturing the heterophily patterns and the multi-dimensional nature of user-item interactions poses significant challenges. To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information through intermediate and late-fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FWHDNN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and scalability in capturing high-order interconnections between users and items.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed and extended results</p></details> |

Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However, challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications.

| **[MIRA: Towards Mitigating Reward Hacking in Inference-Time Alignment of T2I Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01549v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative, modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g., Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO, mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone, extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Step-Aware Policy Optimization for Reasoning in Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01544v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Optimization For Listwise Preference in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01540v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences. Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences. The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed. In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[AortaDiff: A Unified Multitask Diffusion Framework For Contrast-Free AAA Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01498v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks, including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning, enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of 264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61 dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation, it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to nnU-Net.

DiffKnock addresses two key limitations of existing knockoff methods: preserving complex feature dependencies and detecting non-linear associations. Our approach trains diffusion models to generate valid knockoffs and uses neural network--based gradient and filter statistics to construct antisymmetric feature importance measures. Through simulations, we showed that DiffKnock achieved higher power than autoencoder-based knockoffs while maintaining target FDR, indicating its superior performance in scenarios involving complex non-linear architectures. Applied to murine single-cell RNA-seq data of LPS-stimulated macrophages, DiffKnock identifies canonical NF-$\kappa$B target genes (Ccl3, Hmox1) and regulators (Fosb, Pdgfb). These results highlight that, by combining the flexibility of deep generative models with rigorous statistical guarantees, DiffKnock is a powerful and reliable tool for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data, as well as high-dimensional and structured data in other domains.</p></details> |  |

However, task performance alone is not a reliable indicator of the policy's ability to precisely learn constraints in the training data. To investigate, we analyze how well diffusion policies discover these manifolds with a case study on a bimanual pick-and-place task that encourages fulfillment of a kinematic constraint for success. We study how three factors affect trained policies: dataset size, dataset quality, and manifold curvature. Our experiments show diffusion policies learn a coarse approximation of the constraint manifold with learning affected negatively by decreases in both dataset size and quality. On the other hand, the curvature of the constraint manifold showed inconclusive correlations with both constraint satisfaction and task success. A hardware evaluation verifies the applicability of our results in the real world.

We present a latent diffusion model that generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100 tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within 1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs) offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities.

| **[Fine-Tuning Masked Diffusion for Provable Self-Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01384v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality, limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM. Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales: Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective Underfitting in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01378v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle, a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples. Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting: instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new, testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion model for Categorical Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01329v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard discrete diffusion models treat all unobserved states identically by mapping them to an absorbing [MASK] token. This creates an 'information void' where semantic information that could be inferred from unmasked tokens is lost between denoising steps. We introduce Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion (CADD), a framework that augments the discrete state space with a paired diffusion in a continuous latent space. This yields graded, gradually corrupted states in which masked tokens are represented by noisy yet informative latent vectors rather than collapsed 'information voids'. At each reverse step, CADD may leverage the continuous latent as a semantic hint to guide discrete denoising. The design is clean and compatible with existing discrete diffusion training. At sampling time, the strength and choice of estimator for the continuous latent vector enables a controlled trade-off between mode-coverage (generating diverse outputs) and mode-seeking (generating contextually precise outputs) behaviors. Empirically, we demonstrate CADD improves generative quality over mask-based diffusion across text generation, image synthesis, and code modeling, with consistent gains on both qualitative and quantitative metrics against strong discrete baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, the probability distribution effectively sampled by this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to understand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or their log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to learn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing score-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, many figures</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Score Rescaling for Temperature Sampling in Diffusion and Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01184v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a `local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks -- image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter distribution.

| **[Ultra-Fast Language Generation via Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25035v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and high-quality language generation is the holy grail that people pursue in the age of AI. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct (DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that initializes from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language model (dLLM) and distills a few-step student for fast generation. The resulting DiDi-Instruct model achieves comparable or superior performance to its dLLM teacher and the GPT-2 baseline while enabling up to 64$\times$ acceleration. The theoretical foundation of DiDi-Instruct is a novel framework based on integral KL-divergence minimization, which yields a practical training algorithm. We further introduce grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler that significantly improve training stability, model coverage, and inference quality. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct achieves perplexity from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128 NFEs), which outperforms prior accelerated dLLMs and GPT-2 baseline. These gains come with a negligible entropy loss (around $1\%$) and reduce additional training wall-clock time by more than $20\times$ compared to competing dLLM distillation methods. We further validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We employ a standard finite-difference method for spatial discretization coupled with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta temporal schemes. The discrete equation is a generalized Sylvester equation (GSE), which we solve with an adaptive-rank algorithm structured around three key strategies: {(i) constructing dimension-wise subspaces based on an extended Krylov strategy, (ii) developing an effective preconditioner for the reduced coefficient matrix, and (iii) efficiently computing the residual of the equation without explicitly reverting to the full-rank form. {The low-rank decomposition is performed in 2D using SVD, and with high-order SVD (HOSVD) in 3D to represent the tensor in a compressed Tucker format.} The computational complexity of the proposed approach {is demonstrated numerically to} be comparable to the constant-coefficient case [El Kahza et al, J. Comput. Phys., 518 (2024)], scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N {r^2} + {r^{d+1}})$ for $d$-dimensional problems (here, $d = 2$ or $3$), with $N$ the resolution in one dimension and $r$ the maximal rank during the Krylov iteration (which we find to be largely independent of $N$). We present numerical examples that illustrate the computational efficacy and complexity of our algorithm.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Compose Your Policies! Improving Diffusion-based or Flow-based Robot Policies via Test-time Distribution-level Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01068v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action (VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging existing policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sagecao1125.github.io/GPC-Site/</p></details> |
| **[Authentic Discrete Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01047v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations validate the measurable gains of each component.</p></details> |  |
| **[Act to See, See to Act: Diffusion-Driven Perception-Action Interplay for Adaptive Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25822v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce Action-Guided Diffusion Policy (DP-AG), a unified representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP-AG encodes latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning between perception and action, we introduce a cycle-consistent contrastive loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent perception-action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP-AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP-AG offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Secure and reversible face anonymization with diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01031v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other previous work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Syntax-Guided Diffusion Language Models with User-Integrated Personalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01028v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality, diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency, diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling for Bimanual Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13667v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-arm manipulation requires satisfying multiple simultaneous geometric constraints across high-dimensional configuration spaces, which poses a significant challenge for traditional planning and control methods. In this work, we propose Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling (ADCS), a generative framework that flexibly integrates both equality (e.g., relative and absolute pose constraints) and structured inequality constraints (e.g., proximity to object surfaces) into an energy-based diffusion model. Equality constraints are modeled using dedicated energy networks trained on pose differences in Lie algebra space, while inequality constraints are represented via Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and encoded into learned constraint embeddings, allowing the model to reason about complex spatial regions. A key innovation of our method is a Transformer-based architecture that learns to weight constraint-specific energy functions at inference time, enabling flexible and context-aware constraint integration. Moreover, we adopt a two-phase sampling strategy that improves precision and sample diversity by combining Langevin dynamics with resampling and density-aware re-weighting. Experimental results on dual-arm manipulation tasks show that ADCS significantly improves sample diversity and generalization across settings demanding precise coordination and adaptive constraint handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learn to Guide Your Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00815v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution, we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve image-prompt alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaBlock-dLLM: Semantic-Aware Diffusion LLM Inference via Adaptive Block Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26432v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off. However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing. Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free, plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Aside from accelerated sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive, as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the research community.

| **[Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference for Deep Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19078v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI) addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification, and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards More Accurate Diffusion Model Acceleration with A Timestep Tuner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09469v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A diffusion model, which is formulated to produce an image using thousands of denoising steps, usually suffers from a slow inference speed. Existing acceleration algorithms simplify the sampling by skipping most steps yet exhibit considerable performance degradation. By viewing the generation of diffusion models as a discretized integral process, we argue that the quality drop is partly caused by applying an inaccurate integral direction to a timestep interval. To rectify this issue, we propose a \textbf{timestep tuner} that helps find a more accurate integral direction for a particular interval at the minimum cost. Specifically, at each denoising step, we replace the original parameterization by conditioning the network on a new timestep, enforcing the sampling distribution towards the real one. Extensive experiments show that our plug-in design can be trained efficiently and boost the inference performance of various state-of-the-art acceleration methods, especially when there are few denoising steps. For example, when using 10 denoising steps on LSUN Bedroom dataset, we improve the FID of DDIM from 9.65 to 6.07, simply by adopting our method for a more appropriate set of timesteps.

| **[Rectified Diffusion Guidance for Conditional Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18737v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which combines the conditional and unconditional score functions with two coefficients summing to one, serves as a practical technique for diffusion model sampling. Theoretically, however, denoising with CFG \textit{cannot} be expressed as a reciprocal diffusion process, which may consequently leave some hidden risks during use. In this work, we revisit the theory behind CFG and rigorously confirm that the improper configuration of the combination coefficients (\textit{i.e.}, the widely used summing-to-one version) brings about expectation shift of the generative distribution. To rectify this issue, we propose ReCFG with a relaxation on the guidance coefficients such that denoising with \method strictly aligns with the diffusion theory. We further show that our approach enjoys a \textbf{\textit{closed-form}} solution given the guidance strength. That way, the rectified coefficients can be readily pre-computed via traversing the observed data, leaving the sampling speed barely affected. Empirical evidence on real-world data demonstrate the compatibility of our post-hoc design with existing state-of-the-art diffusion models, including both class-conditioned ones (\textit{e.g.}, EDM2 on ImageNet) and text-conditioned ones (\textit{e.g.}, SD3 on CC12M), without any retraining.
