However, these methods require substantial training time. In this paper, we introduce RecTable, which uses the rectified flow modeling, applied in such as text-to-image generation and text-to-video generation. RecTable features a simple architecture consisting of a few stacked gated linear unit blocks. Additionally, our training strategies are also simple, incorporating a mixed-type noise distribution and a logit-normal timestep distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that RecTable achieves competitive performance compared to the several state-of-the-art diffusion and score-based models while reducing the required training time. Our code is available at https://github.com/fmp453/rectable.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAIA-2: A Controllable Multi-View Generative World Model for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20523v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models offer a scalable and flexible paradigm for simulating complex environments, yet current approaches fall short in addressing the domain-specific requirements of autonomous driving - such as multi-agent interactions, fine-grained control, and multi-camera consistency. We introduce GAIA-2, Generative AI for Autonomy, a latent diffusion world model that unifies these capabilities within a single generative framework. GAIA-2 supports controllable video generation conditioned on a rich set of structured inputs: ego-vehicle dynamics, agent configurations, environmental factors, and road semantics. It generates high-resolution, spatiotemporally consistent multi-camera videos across geographically diverse driving environments (UK, US, Germany). The model integrates both structured conditioning and external latent embeddings (e.g., from a proprietary driving model) to facilitate flexible and semantically grounded scene synthesis. Through this integration, GAIA-2 enables scalable simulation of both common and rare driving scenarios, advancing the use of generative world models as a core tool in the development of autonomous systems. Videos are available at https://wayve.ai/thinking/gaia-2.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[VPO: Aligning Text-to-Video Generation Models with Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20491v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video tasks. These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly detailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs during inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes prompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods often rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context learning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent, omit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize prompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can lead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a principled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles: harmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully preserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of generated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization approach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset based on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both text-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with preference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO significantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to baseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video generation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be combined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the effectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/VPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fantastic Copyrighted Beasts and How (Not) to Generate Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14526v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that image and video generation models can be prompted to reproduce copyrighted content from their training data, raising serious legal concerns about copyright infringement. Copyrighted characters (e.g., Mario, Batman) present a significant challenge: at least one lawsuit has already awarded damages based on the generation of such characters. Consequently, commercial services like DALL-E have started deploying interventions. However, little research has systematically examined these problems: (1) Can users easily prompt models to generate copyrighted characters, even if it is unintentional?; (2) How effective are the existing mitigation strategies? To address these questions, we introduce a novel evaluation framework with metrics that assess both the generated image's similarity to copyrighted characters and its consistency with user intent, grounded in a set of popular copyrighted characters from diverse studios and regions. We show that state-of-the-art image and video generation models can still generate characters even if characters' names are not explicitly mentioned, sometimes with only two generic keywords (e.g., prompting with "videogame, plumber" consistently generates Nintendo's Mario character). We also introduce semi-automatic techniques to identify such keywords or descriptions that trigger character generation. Using this framework, we evaluate mitigation strategies, including prompt rewriting and new approaches we propose. Our findings reveal that common methods, such as DALL-E's prompt rewriting, are insufficient alone and require supplementary strategies like negative prompting. Our work provides empirical grounding for discussions on copyright mitigation strategies and offers actionable insights for model deployers implementing these safeguards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Scaling for Flow Models via Stochastic Generation and Rollover Budget Forcing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19385v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://flow-inference-time-scaling.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[VSD2M: A Large-scale Vision-language Sticker Dataset for Multi-frame Animated Sticker Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08259v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a common form of communication in social media,stickers win users' love in the internet scenarios, for their ability to convey emotions in a vivid, cute, and interesting way. People prefer to get an appropriate sticker through retrieval rather than creation for the reason that creating a sticker is time-consuming and relies on rule-based creative tools with limited capabilities. Nowadays, advanced text-to-video algorithms have spawned numerous general video generation systems that allow users to customize high-quality, photo-realistic videos by only providing simple text prompts. However, creating customized animated stickers, which have lower frame rates and more abstract semantics than videos, is greatly hindered by difficulties in data acquisition and incomplete benchmarks. To facilitate the exploration of researchers in animated sticker generation (ASG) field, we firstly construct the currently largest vision-language sticker dataset named VSD2M at a two-million scale that contains static and animated stickers. Secondly, to improve the performance of traditional video generation methods on ASG tasks with discrete characteristics, we propose a Spatial Temporal Interaction (STI) layer that utilizes semantic interaction and detail preservation to address the issue of insufficient information utilization. Moreover, we train baselines with several video generation methods (e.g., transformer-based, diffusion-based methods) on VSD2M and conduct a detailed analysis to establish systemic supervision on ASG task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive large-scale benchmark for multi-frame animated sticker generation, and we hope this work can provide valuable inspiration for other scholars in intelligent creation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiTCtrl: Exploring Attention Control in Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Tuning-Free Multi-Prompt Longer Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18597v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sora-like video generation models have achieved remarkable progress with a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer MM-DiT architecture. However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; 21 pages, 23 figures, Project page: https://onevfall.github.io/project_page/ditctrl ; GitHub repository: https://github.com/TencentARC/DiTCtrl</p></details> |
| **[CogVideoX: Text-to-Video Diffusion Models with An Expert Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06072v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present CogVideoX, a large-scale text-to-video generation model based on diffusion transformer, which can generate 10-second continuous videos aligned with text prompt, with a frame rate of 16 fps and resolution of 768 * 1360 pixels. Previous video generation models often had limited movement and short durations, and is difficult to generate videos with coherent narratives based on text. We propose several designs to address these issues. First, we propose a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions, to improve both compression rate and video fidelity. Second, to improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the two modalities. Third, by employing a progressive training and multi-resolution frame pack technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration, different shape videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method, greatly contributing to the generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show that CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple machine metrics and human evaluations. The model weight of both 3D Causal VAE, Video caption model and CogVideoX are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |
| **[HumanDiT: Pose-Guided Diffusion Transformer for Long-form Human Motion Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04847v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion video generation has advanced significantly, while existing methods still struggle with accurately rendering detailed body parts like hands and faces, especially in long sequences and intricate motions. Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://agnjason.github.io/HumanDiT-page/</p></details> |

Built upon the mainstream diffusion transformer paradigm, Wan achieves significant advancements in generative capabilities through a series of innovations, including our novel VAE, scalable pre-training strategies, large-scale data curation, and automated evaluation metrics. These contributions collectively enhance the model's performance and versatility. Specifically, Wan is characterized by four key features: Leading Performance: The 14B model of Wan, trained on a vast dataset comprising billions of images and videos, demonstrates the scaling laws of video generation with respect to both data and model size.

| **[DAWN: Dynamic Frame Avatar with Non-autoregressive Diffusion Framework for Talking Head Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13726v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Talking head generation intends to produce vivid and realistic talking head videos from a single portrait and speech audio clip. Although significant progress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all methods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context utilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower generation speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (Dynamic frame Avatar With Non-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once generation of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two main components: (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the latent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid videos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements. Additionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation capabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These results highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the field of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks further exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Hanbo-Cheng/DAWN-pytorch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unconditional Priors Matter! Improving Conditional Generation of Fine-Tuned Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20240v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a fundamental technique in training conditional diffusion models. The common practice for CFG-based training is to use a single network to learn both conditional and unconditional noise prediction, with a small dropout rate for conditioning. However, we observe that the joint learning of unconditional noise with limited bandwidth in training results in poor priors for the unconditional case. More importantly, these poor unconditional noise predictions become a serious reason for degrading the quality of conditional generation. Inspired by the fact that most CFG-based conditional models are trained by fine-tuning a base model with better unconditional generation, we first show that simply replacing the unconditional noise in CFG with that predicted by the base model can significantly improve conditional generation. Furthermore, we show that a diffusion model other than the one the fine-tuned model was trained on can be used for unconditional noise replacement. We experimentally verify our claim with a range of CFG-based conditional models for both image and video generation, including Zero-1-to-3, Versatile Diffusion, DiT, DynamiCrafter, and InstructPix2Pix.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Motion Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20218v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Video Motion Graphs, a system designed to generate realistic human motion videos. Using a reference video and conditional signals such as music or motion tags, the system synthesizes new videos by first retrieving video clips with gestures matching the conditions and then generating interpolation frames to seamlessly connect clip boundaries. The core of our approach is HMInterp, a robust Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) model that enables seamless interpolation of discontinuous frames, even for complex motion scenarios like dancing. HMInterp i) employs a dual-branch interpolation approach, combining a Motion Diffusion Model for human skeleton motion interpolation with a diffusion-based video frame interpolation model for final frame generation. ii) adopts condition progressive training to effectively leverage identity strong and weak conditions, such as images and pose. These designs ensure both high video texture quality and accurate motion trajectory. Results show that our Video Motion Graphs outperforms existing generative- and retrieval-based methods for multi-modal conditioned human motion video generation.

| **[EfficientMT: Efficient Temporal Adaptation for Motion Transfer in Text-to-Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19369v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The progress on generative models has led to significant advances on text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet the motion controllability of generated videos remains limited. Existing motion transfer methods explored the motion representations of reference videos to guide generation. Nevertheless, these methods typically rely on sample-specific optimization strategy, resulting in high computational burdens. In this paper, we propose EfficientMT, a novel and efficient end-to-end framework for video motion transfer. By leveraging a small set of synthetic paired motion transfer samples, EfficientMT effectively adapts a pretrained T2V model into a general motion transfer framework that can accurately capture and reproduce diverse motion patterns. Specifically, we repurpose the backbone of the T2V model to extract temporal information from reference videos, and further propose a scaler module to distill motion-related information. Subsequently, we introduce a temporal integration mechanism that seamlessly incorporates reference motion features into the video generation process. After training on our self-collected synthetic paired samples, EfficientMT enables general video motion transfer without requiring test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EfficientMT outperforms existing methods in efficiency while maintaining flexible motion controllability. Our code will be available https://github.com/PrototypeNx/EfficientMT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Human-Object Interaction Synthesis with Multimodal Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20118v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-object interaction (HOI) synthesis is important for various applications, ranging from virtual reality to robotics. However, acquiring 3D HOI data is challenging due to its complexity and high cost, limiting existing methods to the narrow diversity of object types and interaction patterns in training datasets. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot HOI synthesis framework without relying on end-to-end training on currently limited 3D HOI datasets. The core idea of our method lies in leveraging extensive HOI knowledge from pre-trained Multimodal Models. Given a text description, our system first obtains temporally consistent 2D HOI image sequences using image or video generation models, which are then uplifted to 3D HOI milestones of human and object poses. We employ pre-trained human pose estimation models to extract human poses and introduce a generalizable category-level 6-DoF estimation method to obtain the object poses from 2D HOI images. Our estimation method is adaptive to various object templates obtained from text-to-3D models or online retrieval. A physics-based tracking of the 3D HOI kinematic milestone is further applied to refine both body motions and object poses, yielding more physically plausible HOI generation results. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating open-vocabulary HOIs with physical realism and semantic diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation by Frequency Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17440v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity. It is an important task in video generation but remains an open problem for generative models. This paper pushes the technical frontier of IPT2V in two directions that have not been resolved in literature: (1) A tuning-free pipeline without tedious case-by-case finetuning, and (2) A frequency-aware heuristic identity-preserving DiT-based control scheme. We propose ConsisID, a tuning-free DiT-based controllable IPT2V model to keep human identity consistent in the generated video. Inspired by prior findings in frequency analysis of diffusion transformers, it employs identity-control signals in the frequency domain, where facial features can be decomposed into low-frequency global features and high-frequency intrinsic features. First, from a low-frequency perspective, we introduce a global facial extractor, which encodes reference images and facial key points into a latent space, generating features enriched with low-frequency information. These features are then integrated into shallow layers of the network to alleviate training challenges associated with DiT. Second, from a high-frequency perspective, we design a local facial extractor to capture high-frequency details and inject them into transformer blocks, enhancing the model's ability to preserve fine-grained features. We propose a hierarchical training strategy to leverage frequency information for identity preservation, transforming a vanilla pre-trained video generation model into an IPT2V model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our frequency-aware heuristic scheme provides an optimal control solution for DiT-based models. Thanks to this scheme, our ConsisID generates high-quality, identity-preserving videos, making strides towards more effective IPT2V.

| **[FullDiT: Multi-Task Video Generative Foundation Model with Full Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19907v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video generative foundation models primarily focus on text-to-video tasks, providing limited control for fine-grained video content creation. Although adapter-based approaches (e.g., ControlNet) enable additional controls with minimal fine-tuning, they encounter challenges when integrating multiple conditions, including: branch conflicts between independently trained adapters, parameter redundancy leading to increased computational cost, and suboptimal performance compared to full fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we introduce FullDiT, a unified foundation model for video generation that seamlessly integrates multiple conditions via unified full-attention mechanisms. By fusing multi-task conditions into a unified sequence representation and leveraging the long-context learning ability of full self-attention to capture condition dynamics, FullDiT reduces parameter overhead, avoids conditions conflict, and shows scalability and emergent ability. We further introduce FullBench for multi-task video generation evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that FullDiT achieves state-of-the-art results, highlighting the efficacy of full-attention in complex multi-task video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fulldit.github.io/</p></details> |

Current solutions are primarily trained using synthetic data or require tuning of situation-specific heuristics, which inherently limits these models' capabilities in real-world contexts. Despite recent developments in large-scale self-supervised learning from videos, leveraging such representations for motion estimation remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we develop Opt-CWM, a self-supervised technique for flow and occlusion estimation from a pre-trained next-frame prediction model. Opt-CWM works by learning to optimize counterfactual probes that extract motion information from a base video model, avoiding the need for fixed heuristics while training on unrestricted video inputs. We achieve state-of-the-art performance for motion estimation on real-world videos while requiring no labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://neuroailab.github.io/opt_cwm_page/</p></details> |

However, the more challenging task of multi-scene video generation, which offers broader applications, remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Mask$^2$DiT, a novel approach that establishes fine-grained, one-to-one alignment between video segments and their corresponding text annotations. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric binary mask at each attention layer within the DiT architecture, ensuring that each text annotation applies exclusively to its respective video segment while preserving temporal coherence across visual tokens. This attention mechanism enables precise segment-level textual-to-visual alignment, allowing the DiT architecture to effectively handle video generation tasks with a fixed number of scenes. To further equip the DiT architecture with the ability to generate additional scenes based on existing ones, we incorporate a segment-level conditional mask, which conditions each newly generated segment on the preceding video segments, thereby enabling auto-regressive scene extension. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm that Mask$^2$DiT excels in maintaining visual consistency across segments while ensuring semantic alignment between each segment and its corresponding text description.

Moving forward, it is desirable yet challenging to generate holistic human videos with both accurate lip-sync and delicate co-speech gestures w.r.t. given audio. In this work, we propose AudCast, a generalized audio-driven human video generation framework adopting a cascade Diffusion-Transformers (DiTs) paradigm, which synthesizes holistic human videos based on a reference image and a given audio. 1) Firstly, an audio-conditioned Holistic Human DiT architecture is proposed to directly drive the movements of any human body with vivid gesture dynamics. 2) Then to enhance hand and face details that are well-knownly difficult to handle, a Regional Refinement DiT leverages regional 3D fitting as the bridge to reform the signals, producing the final results.

| **[Aether: Geometric-Aware Unified World Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18945v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of geometric reconstruction and generative modeling remains a critical challenge in developing AI systems capable of human-like spatial reasoning. This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables geometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core capabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video prediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved feature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across reconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video generation models, our framework demonstrates unprecedented synthetic-to-real generalization despite never observing real-world data during training. Furthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action following and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling. Remarkably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance is comparable with or even better than that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether employs camera trajectories as geometry-informed action spaces, enabling effective action-conditioned prediction and visual planning.

Despite the promising progress made in the field, it remains a challenging and critical problem to generate videos with accurate poses and fine-grained facial details simultaneously. Essentially, facial motion is often highly complex to model precisely, and the one-shot source face image cannot provide sufficient appearance guidance during generation due to dynamic pose changes. To tackle the problem, we propose to jointly learn motion and appearance codebooks and perform multi-scale codebook compensation to effectively refine both the facial motion conditions and appearance features for talking face image decoding. Specifically, the designed multi-scale motion and appearance codebooks are learned simultaneously in a unified framework to store representative global facial motion flow and appearance patterns. Then, we present a novel multi-scale motion and appearance compensation module, which utilizes a transformer-based codebook retrieval strategy to query complementary information from the two codebooks for joint motion and appearance compensation. The entire process produces motion flows of greater flexibility and appearance features with fewer distortions across different scales, resulting in a high-quality talking head video generation framework. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate superior generation results from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives when compared to state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

However, their iterative denoising nature requires a large number of inference steps to generate a video, which is slow and computationally expensive. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis of the challenges present in existing diffusion distillation methods and propose a novel efficient method, namely AccVideo, to reduce the inference steps for accelerating video diffusion models with synthetic dataset. We leverage the pretrained video diffusion model to generate multiple valid denoising trajectories as our synthetic dataset, which eliminates the use of useless data points during distillation. Based on the synthetic dataset, we design a trajectory-based few-step guidance that utilizes key data points from the denoising trajectories to learn the noise-to-video mapping, enabling video generation in fewer steps. Furthermore, since the synthetic dataset captures the data distribution at each diffusion timestep, we introduce an adversarial training strategy to align the output distribution of the student model with that of our synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing the video quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves 8.5x improvements in generation speed compared to the teacher model while maintaining comparable performance. Compared to previous accelerating methods, our approach is capable of generating videos with higher quality and resolution, i.e., 5-seconds, 720x1280, 24fps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aejion.github.io/accvideo/</p></details> |

Among various physical processes requiring proper representation, radiation plays a fundamental role as it drives Earth's weather and climate systems. However, accurate simulation of radiative transfer processes remains challenging for traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models due to their inherent complexity and high computational costs. Here, we propose FuXi-RTM, a hybrid physics-guided deep learning framework designed to enhance weather forecast accuracy while enforcing physical consistency. FuXi-RTM integrates a primary forecasting model (FuXi) with a fixed deep learning-based radiative transfer model (DLRTM) surrogate that efficiently replaces conventional radiation parameterization schemes. This represents the first deep learning-based weather forecasting framework to explicitly incorporate physical process modeling. Evaluated over a comprehensive 5-year dataset, FuXi-RTM outperforms its unconstrained counterpart in 88.51% of 3320 variable and lead time combinations, with improvements in radiative flux predictions. By incorporating additional physical processes, FuXi-RTM paves the way for next-generation weather forecasting systems that are both accurate and physically consistent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Re-HOLD: Video Hand Object Interaction Reenactment via adaptive Layout-instructed Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16942v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current digital human studies focusing on lip-syncing and body movement are no longer sufficient to meet the growing industrial demand, while human video generation techniques that support interacting with real-world environments (e.g., objects) have not been well investigated. Despite human hand synthesis already being an intricate problem, generating objects in contact with hands and their interactions presents an even more challenging task, especially when the objects exhibit obvious variations in size and shape. To tackle these issues, we present a novel video Reenactment framework focusing on Human-Object Interaction (HOI) via an adaptive Layout-instructed Diffusion model (Re-HOLD). Our key insight is to employ specialized layout representation for hands and objects, respectively. Such representations enable effective disentanglement of hand modeling and object adaptation to diverse motion sequences. To further improve the generation quality of HOI, we design an interactive textural enhancement module for both hands and objects by introducing two independent memory banks. We also propose a layout adjustment strategy for the cross-object reenactment scenario to adaptively adjust unreasonable layouts caused by diverse object sizes during inference. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods.

| **[MVPortrait: Text-Guided Motion and Emotion Control for Multi-view Vivid Portrait Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19383v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent portrait animation methods have made significant strides in generating realistic lip synchronization. However, they often lack explicit control over head movements and facial expressions, and cannot produce videos from multiple viewpoints, resulting in less controllable and expressive animations. Moreover, text-guided portrait animation remains underexplored, despite its user-friendly nature. We present a novel two-stage text-guided framework, MVPortrait (Multi-view Vivid Portrait), to generate expressive multi-view portrait animations that faithfully capture the described motion and emotion. MVPortrait is the first to introduce FLAME as an intermediate representation, effectively embedding facial movements, expressions, and view transformations within its parameter space. In the first stage, we separately train the FLAME motion and emotion diffusion models based on text input. In the second stage, we train a multi-view video generation model conditioned on a reference portrait image and multi-view FLAME rendering sequences from the first stage. Experimental results exhibit that MVPortrait outperforms existing methods in terms of motion and emotion control, as well as view consistency. Furthermore, by leveraging FLAME as a bridge, MVPortrait becomes the first controllable portrait animation framework that is compatible with text, speech, and video as driving signals.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Hardware-Friendly Static Quantization Method for Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15077v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers for video generation have gained significant research interest since the impressive performance of SORA. Efficient deployment of such generative-AI models on GPUs has been demonstrated with dynamic quantization. However, resource-constrained devices cannot support dynamic quantization, and need static quantization of the models for their efficient deployment on AI processors. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the post-training quantization of OpenSora\cite{opensora}, a Video Diffusion Transformer, without relying on dynamic quantization techniques. Our approach employs static quantization, achieving video quality comparable to FP16 and dynamically quantized ViDiT-Q methods, as measured by CLIP, and VQA metrics. In particular, we utilize per-step calibration data to adequately provide a post-training statically quantized model for each time step, incorporating channel-wise quantization for weights and tensor-wise quantization for activations. By further applying the smooth-quantization technique, we can obtain high-quality video outputs with the statically quantized models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that static quantization can be a viable alternative to dynamic quantization for video diffusion transformers, offering a more efficient approach without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Context Autoregressive Video Modeling with Next-Frame Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19325v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language generation, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended temporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce Frame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive modeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens (i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous frames, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion transformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context vision modeling faces challenges due to visual redundancy. Existing RoPE lacks effective temporal decay for remote context and fails to extrapolate well to long video sequences. Additionally, training on long videos is computationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose balancing locality and long-range dependency. We introduce FlexRoPE, an test-time technique that adds flexible temporal decay to RoPE, enabling extrapolation to 16x longer vision contexts. Furthermore, we propose long short-term context modeling, where a high-resolution short-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet effective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://farlongctx.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[GameFactory: Creating New Games with Generative Interactive Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08325v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative videos have the potential to revolutionize game development by autonomously creating new content. In this paper, we present GameFactory, a framework for action-controlled scene-generalizable game video generation. We first address the fundamental challenge of action controllability by introducing GF-Minecraft, a action-annotated game video dataset without human bias, and developing a action control module that enables precise control over both keyboard and mouse inputs. We further extend to support autoregressive generation for unlimited-length interactive videos. More importantly, GameFactory tackles the critical challenge of scene-generalizable action control, which most existing methods fail to address. To enable the creation of entirely new and diverse games beyond fixed styles and scenes, we leverage the open-domain generative priors from pre-trained video diffusion models. To bridge the domain gap between open-domain priors and small-scale game datasets, we propose a multi-phase training strategy with a domain adapter that decouples game style learning from action control. This decoupling ensures that action control learning is no longer bound to specific game styles, thereby achieving scene-generalizable action control. Experimental results demonstrate that GameFactory effectively generates open-domain action-controllable game videos, representing a significant step forward in AI-driven game generation.

| **[Improved Training Technique for Latent Consistency Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01441v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistency models are a new family of generative models capable of producing high-quality samples in either a single step or multiple steps. Recently, consistency models have demonstrated impressive performance, achieving results on par with diffusion models in the pixel space. However, the success of scaling consistency training to large-scale datasets, particularly for text-to-image and video generation tasks, is determined by performance in the latent space. In this work, we analyze the statistical differences between pixel and latent spaces, discovering that latent data often contains highly impulsive outliers, which significantly degrade the performance of iCT in the latent space. To address this, we replace Pseudo-Huber losses with Cauchy losses, effectively mitigating the impact of outliers. Additionally, we introduce a diffusion loss at early timesteps and employ optimal transport (OT) coupling to further enhance performance. Lastly, we introduce the adaptive scaling-$c$ scheduler to manage the robust training process and adopt Non-scaling LayerNorm in the architecture to better capture the statistics of the features and reduce outlier impact. With these strategies, we successfully train latent consistency models capable of high-quality sampling with one or two steps, significantly narrowing the performance gap between latent consistency and diffusion models.

However, existing models struggle to balance computational efficiency and high visual quality, particularly on resource-limited devices, e.g.,iGPUs and mobile phones. Most prior work prioritizes visual fidelity while overlooking the need for smaller, more efficient models suitable for real-world deployment. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight T2V framework, termed Hummingbird, which prunes existing models and enhances visual quality through visual feedback learning. Our approach reduces the size of the U-Net from 1.4 billion to 0.7 billion parameters, significantly improving efficiency while preserving high-quality video generation. Additionally, we introduce a novel data processing pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models to enhance the quality of both text prompts and video data. To support user-driven training and style customization, we publicly release the full training code, including data processing and model training. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 31X speedup compared to state-of-the-art models such as VideoCrafter2, while also attaining the highest overall score on VBench. Moreover, our method supports the generation of videos with up to 26 frames, addressing the limitations of existing U-Net-based methods in long video generation. Notably, the entire training process requires only four GPUs, yet delivers performance competitive with existing leading methods. Hummingbird presents a practical and efficient solution for T2V generation, combining high performance, scalability, and flexibility for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/technical-articles/amd-hummingbird-0-9b-text-to-video-diffusion-model-with-4-step-inferencing.html| GitHub: https://github.com/AMD-AIG-AIMA/AMD-Hummingbird-T2V</p></details> |
| **[Zeroth-order Informed Fine-Tuning for Diffusion Model: A Recursive Likelihood Ratio Optimizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00639v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The probabilistic diffusion model (DM), generating content by inferencing through a recursive chain structure, has emerged as a powerful framework for visual generation. After pre-training on enormous unlabeled data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a zeroth-order informed fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The zeroth-order gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with the lower variance than other methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of the RLR. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation tasks to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.</p></details> |  |

Despite their impressive capabilities, current Video-LMMs have not been evaluated for anomaly detection tasks, which is critical to their deployment in practical scenarios e.g., towards identifying deepfakes, manipulated video content, traffic accidents and crimes. In this paper, we introduce VANE-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the proficiency of Video-LMMs in detecting and localizing anomalies and inconsistencies in videos. Our dataset comprises an array of videos synthetically generated using existing state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, encompassing a variety of subtle anomalies and inconsistencies grouped into five categories: unnatural transformations, unnatural appearance, pass-through, disappearance and sudden appearance. Additionally, our benchmark features real-world samples from existing anomaly detection datasets, focusing on crime-related irregularities, atypical pedestrian behavior, and unusual events. The task is structured as a visual question-answering challenge to gauge the models' ability to accurately detect and localize the anomalies within the videos. We evaluate nine existing Video-LMMs, both open and closed sources, on this benchmarking task and find that most of the models encounter difficulties in effectively identifying the subtle anomalies. In conclusion, our research offers significant insights into the current capabilities of Video-LMMs in the realm of anomaly detection, highlighting the importance of our work in evaluating and improving these models for real-world applications.

Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more inference-time computation. Instead of scaling up video foundation models through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target video distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching process. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs, we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute consistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.

This computational burden primarily arises from the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video resolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality or necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are pre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these low-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading performance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free framework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead while preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high denoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and final stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To mitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution transition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage. We evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where extensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to 3$\times$ for image generation and 2.5$\times$ for video generation, all while maintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling process across multiple evaluation metrics.

Most methods rely on leveraging annotations such as text, objects' bounding boxes, and motion cues, which require substantial human effort and thus limit their scalability. In contrast, we address the challenge of controllable and compositional video generation without any annotations by introducing a novel unsupervised approach. Our model is trained from scratch on a dataset of unannotated videos. At inference time, it can compose plausible novel scenes and animate objects by placing object parts at the desired locations in space and time. The core innovation of our method lies in the unified control format and the training process, where video generation is conditioned on a randomly selected subset of pre-trained self-supervised local features. This conditioning compels the model to learn how to inpaint the missing information in the video both spatially and temporally, thereby learning the inherent compositionality of a scene and the dynamics of moving objects. The abstraction level and the imposed invariance of the conditioning input to minor visual perturbations enable control over object motion by simply using the same features at all the desired future locations. We call our model CAGE, which stands for visual Composition and Animation for video GEneration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of CAGE across various scenarios, demonstrating its capability to accurately follow the control and to generate high-quality videos that exhibit coherent scene composition and realistic animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI2025; Project website: https://araachie.github.io/cage</p></details> |

These motion cues are typically derived from video data but are susceptible to limitations including low temporal resolution, motion blur, overexposure, and inaccuracies under low-light conditions. In contrast, event cameras provide data streams with exceptionally high temporal resolution, a wide dynamic range, and inherent resistance to motion blur and exposure issues. In this work, we propose EvAnimate, a framework that leverages event streams as motion cues to animate static human images. Our approach employs a specialized event representation that transforms asynchronous event streams into 3-channel slices with controllable slicing rates and appropriate slice density, ensuring compatibility with diffusion models. Subsequently, a dual-branch architecture generates high-quality videos by harnessing the inherent motion dynamics of the event streams, thereby enhancing both video quality and temporal consistency. Specialized data augmentation strategies further enhance cross-person generalization. Finally, we establish a new benchmarking, including simulated event data for training and validation, and a real-world event dataset capturing human actions under normal and extreme scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate that EvAnimate achieves high temporal fidelity and robust performance in scenarios where traditional video-derived cues fall short.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Text-to-Video Generation help Video-Language Alignment?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18507v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video-language alignment models are trained on sets of videos, each with an associated positive caption and a negative caption generated by large language models. A problem with this procedure is that negative captions may introduce linguistic biases, i.e., concepts are seen only as negatives and never associated with a video. While a solution would be to collect videos for the negative captions, existing databases lack the fine-grained variations needed to cover all possible negatives. In this work, we study whether synthetic videos can help to overcome this issue. Our preliminary analysis with multiple generators shows that, while promising on some tasks, synthetic videos harm the performance of the model on others. We hypothesize this issue is linked to noise (semantic and visual) in the generated videos and develop a method, SynViTA, that accounts for those. SynViTA dynamically weights the contribution of each synthetic video based on how similar its target caption is w.r.t. the real counterpart. Moreover, a semantic consistency loss makes the model focus on fine-grained differences across captions, rather than differences in video appearance. Experiments show that, on average, SynViTA improves over existing methods on VideoCon test sets and SSv2-Temporal, SSv2-Events, and ATP-Hard benchmarks, being a first promising step for using synthetic videos when learning video-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Beyond the challenge of lengthy animation times, a critical challenge in realistic talking head generation lies in preserving the natural movement of diverse body parts. To this end, we propose Teller, the first streaming audio-driven protrait animation framework with autoregressive motion generation. Specifically, Teller first decomposes facial and body detail animation into two components: Facial Motion Latent Generation (FMLG) based on an autoregressive transfromer, and movement authenticity refinement using a Efficient Temporal Module (ETM).Concretely, FMLG employs a Residual VQ model to map the facial motion latent from the implicit keypoint-based model into discrete motion tokens, which are then temporally sliced with audio embeddings. This enables the AR tranformer to learn real-time, stream-based mappings from audio to motion. Furthermore, Teller incorporate ETM to capture finer motion details. This module ensures the physical consistency of body parts and accessories, such as neck muscles and earrings, improving the realism of these movements. Teller is designed to be efficient, surpassing the inference speed of diffusion-based models (Hallo 20.93s vs. Teller 0.92s for one second video generation), and achieves a real-time streaming performance of up to 25 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent audio-driven portrait animation models, especially in small movements, as validated by human evaluations with a significant margin in quality and realism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept in CVPR 2025 Conference Submission</p></details> |

However, current text-to-video generation models still face significant challenges such as high training costs, substantial data requirements, and difficulties in maintaining consistency between given text and motion of the foreground object. To address these challenges, we propose mask-guided video generation, which can control video generation through mask motion sequences, while requiring limited training data. Our model enhances existing architectures by incorporating foreground masks for precise text-position matching and motion trajectory control. Through mask motion sequences, we guide the video generation process to maintain consistent foreground objects throughout the sequence. Additionally, through a first-frame sharing strategy and autoregressive extension approach, we achieve more stable and longer video generation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that this approach excels in various video generation tasks, such as video editing and generating artistic videos, outperforming previous methods in terms of consistency and quality.

Text-to-video generation has made remarkable progress over the past year, but the absence of harmonious audio in generated video limits its broader applications. In this paper, we propose Semantic and Temporal Aligned Video-to-Audio (STA-V2A), an approach that enhances audio generation from videos by extracting both local temporal and global semantic video features and combining these refined video features with text as cross-modal guidance. To address the issue of information redundancy in videos, we propose an onset prediction pretext task for local temporal feature extraction and an attentive pooling module for global semantic feature extraction. To supplement the insufficient semantic information in videos, we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with Text-to-Audio priors initialization and cross-modal guidance. We also introduce Audio-Audio Align, a new metric to assess audio-temporal alignment. Subjective and objective metrics demonstrate that our method surpasses existing Video-to-Audio models in generating audio with better quality, semantic consistency, and temporal alignment.

Our LongDiff unlocks the potential of off-the-shelf video diffusion models to achieve high-quality long video generation in one go. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</p></details> |  |

The quality of AI video continues to improve, but at the cost of larger model size, increased data quantity, and greater demand for training compute. In this report, we present Open-Sora 2.0, a commercial-level video generation model trained for only $200k. With this model, we demonstrate that the cost of training a top-performing video generation model is highly controllable. We detail all techniques that contribute to this efficiency breakthrough, including data curation, model architecture, training strategy, and system optimization. According to human evaluation results and VBench scores, Open-Sora 2.0 is comparable to global leading video generation models including the open-source HunyuanVideo and the closed-source Runway Gen-3 Alpha. By making Open-Sora 2.0 fully open-source, we aim to democratize access to advanced video generation technology, fostering broader innovation and creativity in content creation.

However, existing controlled diffusion transformer methods incur significant parameter and computational overheads and suffer from inefficient resource allocation due to their failure to account for the varying relevance of control information across different transformer layers. To address this, we propose the Relevance-Guided Efficient Controllable Generation framework, RelaCtrl, enabling efficient and resource-optimized integration of control signals into the Diffusion Transformer. First, we evaluate the relevance of each layer in the Diffusion Transformer to the control information by assessing the "ControlNet Relevance Score"-i.e., the impact of skipping each control layer on both the quality of generation and the control effectiveness during inference. Based on the strength of the relevance, we then tailor the positioning, parameter scale, and modeling capacity of the control layers to reduce unnecessary parameters and redundant computations. Additionally, to further improve efficiency, we replace the self-attention and FFN in the commonly used copy block with the carefully designed Two-Dimensional Shuffle Mixer (TDSM), enabling efficient implementation of both the token mixer and channel mixer. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance with only 15% of the parameters and computational complexity compared to PixArt-delta.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://360cvgroup.github.io/RelaCtrl/ Github: https://github.com/360CVGroup/RelaCtrl</p></details> |

Though reinforcement learning from human feedback offers promise for preference alignment, existing reward models for visual generation face limitations, including black-box scoring without interpretability and potentially resultant unexpected biases. We present VisionReward, a general framework for learning human visual preferences in both image and video generation. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical visual assessment framework to capture fine-grained human preferences, and leverages linear weighting to enable interpretable preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-dimensional consistent strategy when using VisionReward as a reward model during preference optimization for visual generation. Experiments show that VisionReward can significantly outperform existing image and video reward models on both machine metrics and human evaluation. Notably, VisionReward surpasses VideoScore by 17.2% in preference prediction accuracy, and text-to-video models with VisionReward achieve a 31.6% higher pairwise win rate compared to the same models using VideoScore.

Within diffusion frameworks, guidance techniques have proven effective in enhancing output quality during inference; however, applying these methods to video diffusion models introduces additional complexity of handling computations across entire sequences. To address this, we propose a novel framework called MotionPrompt that guides the video generation process via optical flow. Specifically, we train a discriminator to distinguish optical flow between random pairs of frames from real videos and generated ones. Given that prompts can influence the entire video, we optimize learnable token embeddings during reverse sampling steps by using gradients from a trained discriminator applied to random frame pairs. This approach allows our method to generate visually coherent video sequences that closely reflect natural motion dynamics, without compromising the fidelity of the generated content. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various models.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (poster); project page: https://motionprompt.github.io/</p></details> |

However, generating RGBA videos with alpha channels for transparency and visual effects remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of suitable datasets and the complexity of adapting existing models for this purpose. To address these limitations, we present TransAnimate, an innovative framework that integrates RGBA image generation techniques with video generation modules, enabling the creation of dynamic and transparent videos. TransAnimate efficiently leverages pre-trained text-to-transparent image model weights and combines them with temporal models and controllability plugins trained on RGB videos, adapting them for controllable RGBA video generation tasks. Additionally, we introduce an interactive motion-guided control mechanism, where directional arrows define movement and colors adjust scaling, offering precise and intuitive control for designing game effects. To further alleviate data scarcity, we have developed a pipeline for creating an RGBA video dataset, incorporating high-quality game effect videos, extracted foreground objects, and synthetic transparent videos. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TransAnimate generates high-quality RGBA videos, establishing it as a practical and effective tool for applications in gaming and visual effects.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing models lack fine-grained control over camera movement, which is critical for downstream applications related to content creation, visual effects, and 3D vision. Recently, new methods demonstrate the ability to generate videos with controllable camera poses these techniques leverage pre-trained U-Net-based diffusion models that explicitly disentangle spatial and temporal generation. Still, no existing approach enables camera control for new, transformer-based video diffusion models that process spatial and temporal information jointly. Here, we propose to tame video transformers for 3D camera control using a ControlNet-like conditioning mechanism that incorporates spatiotemporal camera embeddings based on Pl\"ucker coordinates. The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for controllable video generation after fine-tuning on the RealEstate10K dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to enable camera control for transformer-based video diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; Project Page: https://snap-research.github.io/vd3d/</p></details> |

In this work, we analyze camera motion from a first principles perspective, uncovering insights that enable precise 3D camera manipulation without compromising synthesis quality. First, we determine that motion induced by camera movements in videos is low-frequency in nature. This motivates us to adjust train and test pose conditioning schedules, accelerating training convergence while improving visual and motion quality. Then, by probing the representations of an unconditional video diffusion transformer, we observe that they implicitly perform camera pose estimation under the hood, and only a sub-portion of their layers contain the camera information. This suggested us to limit the injection of camera conditioning to a subset of the architecture to prevent interference with other video features, leading to a 4x reduction of training parameters, improved training speed, and 10% higher visual quality. Finally, we complement the typical dataset for camera control learning with a curated dataset of 20K diverse, dynamic videos with stationary cameras. This helps the model distinguish between camera and scene motion and improves the dynamics of generated pose-conditioned videos. We compound these findings to design the Advanced 3D Camera Control (AC3D) architecture, the new state-of-the-art model for generative video modeling with camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project Page: https://snap-research.github.io/ac3d/</p></details> |
| **[RDTF: Resource-efficient Dual-mask Training Framework for Multi-frame Animated Sticker Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17735v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, great progress has been made in video generation technology, attracting the widespread attention of scholars. To apply this technology to downstream applications under resource-constrained conditions, researchers usually fine-tune the pre-trained models based on parameter-efficient tuning methods such as Adapter or Lora. Although these methods can transfer the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, fewer training parameters lead to poor fitting ability, and the knowledge from the source domain may lead to the inference process deviating from the target domain. In this paper, we argue that under constrained resources, training a smaller video generation model from scratch using only million-level samples can outperform parameter-efficient tuning on larger models in downstream applications: the core lies in the effective utilization of data and curriculum strategy. Take animated sticker generation (ASG) as a case study, we first construct a discrete frame generation network for stickers with low frame rates, ensuring that its parameters meet the requirements of model training under constrained resources. In order to provide data support for models trained from scratch, we come up with a dual-mask based data utilization strategy, which manages to improve the availability and expand the diversity of limited data. To facilitate convergence under dual-mask situation, we propose a difficulty-adaptive curriculum learning method, which decomposes the sample entropy into static and adaptive components so as to obtain samples from easy to difficult. The experiment demonstrates that our resource-efficient dual-mask training framework is quantitatively and qualitatively superior to efficient-parameter tuning methods such as I2V-Adapter and SimDA, verifying the feasibility of our method on downstream tasks under constrained resources. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we propose a simple pipeline to leverage in-context generation: ($\textbf{i}$) concatenate videos along spacial or time dimension, ($\textbf{ii}$) jointly caption multi-scene video clips from one source, and ($\textbf{iii}$) apply task-specific fine-tuning using carefully curated small datasets. Through a series of diverse controllable tasks, we demonstrate qualitatively that existing advanced text-to-video models can effectively perform in-context generation. Notably, it allows for the creation of consistent multi-scene videos exceeding 30 seconds in duration, without additional computational overhead. Importantly, this method requires no modifications to the original models, results in high-fidelity video outputs that better align with prompt specifications and maintain role consistency. Our framework presents a valuable tool for the research community and offers critical insights for advancing product-level controllable video generation systems.

| **[Generating, Fast and Slow: Scalable Parallel Video Generation with Video Interface Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17539v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) can generate short photorealistic videos, yet directly training and sampling longer videos with full attention across the video remains computationally challenging. Alternative methods break long videos down into sequential generation of short video segments, requiring multiple sampling chain iterations and specialized consistency modules. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new paradigm called Video Interface Networks (VINs), which augment DiTs with an abstraction module to enable parallel inference of video chunks. At each diffusion step, VINs encode global semantics from the noisy input of local chunks and the encoded representations, in turn, guide DiTs in denoising chunks in parallel. The coupling of VIN and DiT is learned end-to-end on the denoising objective. Further, the VIN architecture maintains fixed-size encoding tokens that encode the input via a single cross-attention step. Disentangling the encoding tokens from the input thus enables VIN to scale to long videos and learn essential semantics. Experiments on VBench demonstrate that VINs surpass existing chunk-based methods in preserving background consistency and subject coherence. We then show via an optical flow analysis that our approach attains state-of-the-art motion smoothness while using 25-40% fewer FLOPs than full generation. Finally, human raters favorably assessed the overall video quality and temporal consistency of our method in a user study.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing methods cannot synthesize interactions in unseen environments such as in-the-wild scenes or reconstructed scenes, as they rely on paired 3D scenes and captured human motion data for training, which are unavailable for unseen environments. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis, eliminating the need for training on any MoCap data. Our key insight is to distill human-scene interactions from state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/ The first two authors contribute equally</p></details> |

Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 16 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.

We propose a novel self-supervised framework for generating drawing processes from any type of image, treating the task as a video generation problem. Our approach reverses the drawing process by progressively removing strokes from a reference image, simulating a human-like creation sequence. Crucially, our method does not require costly datasets of real human drawing processes; instead, we leverage depth estimation and stroke rendering to construct a self-supervised dataset. We model human drawings as "refinement" and "layering" processes and introduce depth fusion layers to enable video generation models to learn and replicate human drawing behavior. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to generate realistic drawings without the need for real drawing process data.</p></details> |  |

Block-sparse attention mitigates this by focusing computation on critical regions, yet existing methods struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency due to costly block importance measurements. In this paper, we introduce XAttention, a plug-and-play framework that dramatically accelerates long-context inference in Transformers models using sparse attention. XAttention's key innovation is the insight that the sum of antidiagonal values (i.e., from the lower-left to upper-right) in the attention matrix provides a powerful proxy for block importance. This allows for precise identification and pruning of non-essential blocks, resulting in high sparsity and dramatically accelerated inference. Across comprehensive evaluations on demanding long-context benchmarks-including RULER and LongBench for language, VideoMME for video understanding, and VBench for video generation. XAttention achieves accuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial computational gains. We demonstrate up to 13.5x acceleration in attention computation. These results underscore XAttention's ability to unlock the practical potential of block sparse attention, paving the way for scalable and efficient deployment of LCTMs in real-world applications.

However, existing methods often focus on limited domains, require time-consuming optimization per subject, or support only a single subject. We present Video Alchemist $-$ a video model with built-in multi-subject, open-set personalization capabilities for both foreground objects and background, eliminating the need for time-consuming test-time optimization. Our model is built on a new Diffusion Transformer module that fuses each conditional reference image and its corresponding subject-level text prompt with cross-attention layers. Developing such a large model presents two main challenges: dataset and evaluation. First, as paired datasets of reference images and videos are extremely hard to collect, we sample selected video frames as reference images and synthesize a clip of the target video. However, while models can easily denoise training videos given reference frames, they fail to generalize to new contexts. To mitigate this issue, we design a new automatic data construction pipeline with extensive image augmentations. Second, evaluating open-set video personalization is a challenge in itself. To address this, we introduce a personalization benchmark that focuses on accurate subject fidelity and supports diverse personalization scenarios. Finally, our extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing personalization methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering.

| **[ScalingNoise: Scaling Inference-Time Search for Generating Infinite Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16400v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (VDMs) facilitate the generation of high-quality videos, with current research predominantly concentrated on scaling efforts during training through improvements in data quality, computational resources, and model complexity. However, inference-time scaling has received less attention, with most approaches restricting models to a single generation attempt. Recent studies have uncovered the existence of "golden noises" that can enhance video quality during generation. Building on this, we find that guiding the scaling inference-time search of VDMs to identify better noise candidates not only evaluates the quality of the frames generated in the current step but also preserves the high-level object features by referencing the anchor frame from previous multi-chunks, thereby delivering long-term value. Our analysis reveals that diffusion models inherently possess flexible adjustments of computation by varying denoising steps, and even a one-step denoising approach, when guided by a reward signal, yields significant long-term benefits. Based on the observation, we proposeScalingNoise, a plug-and-play inference-time search strategy that identifies golden initial noises for the diffusion sampling process to improve global content consistency and visual diversity. Specifically, we perform one-step denoising to convert initial noises into a clip and subsequently evaluate its long-term value, leveraging a reward model anchored by previously generated content. Moreover, to preserve diversity, we sample candidates from a tilted noise distribution that up-weights promising noises. In this way, ScalingNoise significantly reduces noise-induced errors, ensuring more coherent and spatiotemporally consistent video generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed ScalingNoise effectively improves long video generation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce VideoGen-of-Thought (VGoT), a step-by-step framework that automates multi-shot video synthesis from a single sentence by systematically addressing three core challenges: (1) Narrative Fragmentation: Existing methods lack structured storytelling. We propose dynamic storyline modeling, which first converts the user prompt into concise shot descriptions, then elaborates them into detailed, cinematic specifications across five domains (character dynamics, background continuity, relationship evolution, camera movements, HDR lighting), ensuring logical narrative progression with self-validation. (2) Visual Inconsistency: Existing approaches struggle with maintaining visual consistency across shots. Our identity-aware cross-shot propagation generates identity-preserving portrait (IPP) tokens that maintain character fidelity while allowing trait variations (expressions, aging) dictated by the storyline. (3) Transition Artifacts: Abrupt shot changes disrupt immersion. Our adjacent latent transition mechanisms implement boundary-aware reset strategies that process adjacent shots' features at transition points, enabling seamless visual flow while preserving narrative continuity. VGoT generates multi-shot videos that outperform state-of-the-art baselines by 20.4% in within-shot face consistency and 17.4% in style consistency, while achieving over 100% better cross-shot consistency and 10x fewer manual adjustments than alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper should be a refined version of arXiv:2412.02259, "VideoGen-of-Thought: A Collaborative Framework for Multi-Shot Video Generation", but I mistakenly submit it as a new paper</p></details> |

However, significant challenges remain, as these models often struggle to follow complex edit instructions accurately and frequently compromise fidelity by altering key elements of the original image. Simultaneously, video generation has made remarkable strides, with models that effectively function as consistent and continuous world simulators. In this paper, we propose merging these two fields by utilizing image-to-video models for image editing. We reformulate image editing as a temporal process, using pretrained video models to create smooth transitions from the original image to the desired edit. This approach traverses the image manifold continuously, ensuring consistent edits while preserving the original image's key aspects. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on text-based image editing, demonstrating significant improvements in both edit accuracy and image preservation.

World models, which predict and generate future environmental states, offer a promising solution by synthesizing annotated video data for training. However, existing methods struggle to generate long, consistent videos without accumulating errors, especially in dynamic scenes. To address this, we propose MiLA, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, long-duration videos up to one minute. MiLA utilizes a Coarse-to-Re(fine) approach to both stabilize video generation and correct distortion of dynamic objects. Additionally, we introduce a Temporal Progressive Denoising Scheduler and Joint Denoising and Correcting Flow modules to improve the quality of generated videos. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that MiLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation quality.

To generate diverse camera poses and unbounded spatial extent of real-world scenes, while ensuring generalization to arbitrary text prompts, previous methods fine-tune 2D generative models to jointly model camera poses and multi-view images. However, these methods suffer from instability when extending 2D generative models to joint modeling due to the modality gap, which necessitates additional models to stabilize training and inference. In this work, we propose an architecture and a sampling strategy to jointly model multi-view images and camera poses when fine-tuning a video generation model. Our core idea is a dual-stream architecture that attaches a dedicated pose generation model alongside a pre-trained video generation model via communication blocks, generating multi-view images and camera poses through separate streams. This design reduces interference between the pose and image modalities. Additionally, we propose an asynchronous sampling strategy that denoises camera poses faster than multi-view images, allowing rapidly denoised poses to condition multi-view generation, reducing mutual ambiguity and enhancing cross-modal consistency. Trained on multiple large-scale real-world datasets (RealEstate10K, MVImgNet, DL3DV-10K, ACID), VideoRFSplat outperforms existing text-to-3D direct generation methods that heavily depend on post-hoc refinement via score distillation sampling, achieving superior results without such refinement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gohyojun15.github.io/VideoRFSplat/</p></details> |

Existing solutions either rely on extensive manual scripting/editing or prioritize single-shot fidelity over cross-scene continuity, limiting their practicality for movie-like content. We introduce VideoGen-of-Thought (VGoT), a step-by-step framework that automates multi-shot video synthesis from a single sentence by systematically addressing three core challenges: (1) Narrative Fragmentation: Existing methods lack structured storytelling. We propose dynamic storyline modeling, which first converts the user prompt into concise shot descriptions, then elaborates them into detailed, cinematic specifications across five domains (character dynamics, background continuity, relationship evolution, camera movements, HDR lighting), ensuring logical narrative progression with self-validation. (2) Visual Inconsistency: Existing approaches struggle with maintaining visual consistency across shots. Our identity-aware cross-shot propagation generates identity-preserving portrait (IPP) tokens that maintain character fidelity while allowing trait variations (expressions, aging) dictated by the storyline. (3) Transition Artifacts: Abrupt shot changes disrupt immersion. Our adjacent latent transition mechanisms implement boundary-aware reset strategies that process adjacent shots' features at transition points, enabling seamless visual flow while preserving narrative continuity. VGoT generates multi-shot videos that outperform state-of-the-art baselines by 20.4% in within-shot face consistency and 17.4% in style consistency, while achieving over 100% better cross-shot consistency and 10x fewer manual adjustments than alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/DuNGEOnmassster/VideoGen-of-Thought.git; Webpage: https://cheliosoops.github.io/VGoT/</p></details> |

However, these models often generate videos that have misalignments with text prompts, especially when the prompts describe complex scenes with multiple objects and attributes. To address this, we introduce VideoRepair, a novel model-agnostic, training-free video refinement framework that automatically identifies fine-grained text-video misalignments and generates explicit spatial and textual feedback, enabling a T2V diffusion model to perform targeted, localized refinements. VideoRepair consists of two stages: In (1) video refinement planning, we first detect misalignments by generating fine-grained evaluation questions and answering them using an MLLM. Based on video evaluation outputs, we identify accurately generated objects and construct localized prompts to precisely refine misaligned regions. In (2) localized refinement, we enhance video alignment by 'repairing' the misaligned regions from the original video while preserving the correctly generated areas. This is achieved by frame-wise region decomposition using our Region-Preserving Segmentation (RPS) module. On two popular video generation benchmarks (EvalCrafter and T2V-CompBench), VideoRepair substantially outperforms recent baselines across various text-video alignment metrics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of VideoRepair components and qualitative examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://video-repair.github.io</p></details> |

Operating at the data level, FluxFlow applies controlled temporal perturbations without requiring architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and VBench benchmarks demonstrate that FluxFlow significantly improves temporal coherence and diversity across various video generation models, including U-Net, DiT, and AR-based architectures, while preserving spatial fidelity.

Unlike prior work requiring motion capture data, our approach fine-tunes only on dance videos.

However, existing methods still struggle with accurately binding attributes, determining spatial relationships, and capturing complex action interactions between multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we propose MagicComp, a training-free method that enhances compositional T2V generation through dual-phase refinement. Specifically, (1) During the Conditioning Stage: We introduce the Semantic Anchor Disambiguation to reinforces subject-specific semantics and resolve inter-subject ambiguity by progressively injecting the directional vectors of semantic anchors into original text embedding; (2) During the Denoising Stage: We propose Dynamic Layout Fusion Attention, which integrates grounding priors and model-adaptive spatial perception to flexibly bind subjects to their spatiotemporal regions through masked attention modulation. Furthermore, MagicComp is a model-agnostic and versatile approach, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing T2V architectures. Extensive experiments on T2V-CompBench and VBench demonstrate that MagicComp outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential for applications such as complex prompt-based and trajectory-controllable video generation.

Current synthetic datasets primarily replicate real-world scenarios, leaving impossible, counterfactual and anti-reality video concepts underexplored. This work aims to answer two questions: 1) Can today's video generation models effectively follow prompts to create impossible video content? 2) Are today's video understanding models good enough for understanding impossible videos? To this end, we introduce IPV-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate and foster progress in video understanding and generation. IPV-Bench is underpinned by a comprehensive taxonomy, encompassing 4 domains, 14 categories. It features diverse scenes that defy physical, biological, geographical, or social laws. Based on the taxonomy, a prompt suite is constructed to evaluate video generation models, challenging their prompt following and creativity capabilities. In addition, a video benchmark is curated to assess Video-LLMs on their ability of understanding impossible videos, which particularly requires reasoning on temporal dynamics and world knowledge. Comprehensive evaluations reveal limitations and insights for future directions of video models, paving the way for next-generation video models.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Existing methods primarily employ LLM for high-level planning to decompose a story into scene-level descriptions, which are then independently generated and stitched together. However, these approaches struggle with generating high-quality videos aligned with the complex single-scene description, as visualizing such complex description involves coherent composition of multiple characters and events, complex motion synthesis and muti-character customization. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next, DreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame semantic control. We compare DreamRunner with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DreamRunner exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DreamRunner's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://zunwang1.github.io/DreamRunner</p></details> |

However, as LVDM training scales, the computational overhead of Video VAEs becomes a critical bottleneck, particularly for encoding high-resolution videos. To address this, we propose LeanVAE, a novel and ultra-efficient Video VAE framework that introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight architecture based on a Neighborhood-Aware Feedforward (NAF) module and non-overlapping patch operations, drastically reducing computational cost, and (2) the integration of wavelet transforms and compressed sensing techniques to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments validate LeanVAE's superiority in video reconstruction and generation, particularly in enhancing efficiency over existing Video VAEs. Our model offers up to 50x fewer FLOPs and 44x faster inference speed while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, providing insights for scalable, efficient video generation.

In this work, we propose UES (Unlocking Universal Editing via Self-Supervision), a lightweight self-supervised fine-tuning strategy that transforms generation models into unified generation-editing systems through self-supervised semantic alignment. Our approach establishes a dual-conditioning mechanism where original video-text pairs jointly provide visual and textual semantics, enabling structured learning of intrinsic spatiotemporal correspondences. Key advantages include: (i) Universality through supervision-free adaptation to diverse editing tasks, (ii) Unification of generation and editing applicable to most text(+image)-to-video model, and (iii) Efficiency via lightweight fine-tune that reduces tunable parameters by 92.67%. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce OmniBench-99, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 99 videos across humans/animals, environments, and objects, comprising 4 editing types and 8 scenarios.

In this paper, we propose Diagonal Decoding (DiagD), a training-free inference acceleration algorithm for autoregressively pre-trained models that exploits spatial and temporal correlations in videos. Our method generates tokens along diagonal paths in the spatial-temporal token grid, enabling parallel decoding within each frame as well as partially overlapping across consecutive frames. The proposed algorithm is versatile and adaptive to various generative models and tasks, while providing flexible control over the trade-off between inference speed and visual quality. Furthermore, we propose a cost-effective finetuning strategy that aligns the attention patterns of the model with our decoding order, further mitigating the training-inference gap on small-scale models. Experiments on multiple autoregressive video generation models and datasets demonstrate that DiagD achieves up to $10\times$ speedup compared to naive sequential decoding, while maintaining comparable visual fidelity.</p></details> |  |

Existing metrics lack a unified framework for systematically categorizing methodologies, limiting a holistic understanding of the evaluation landscape. Additionally, fragmented implementations and the absence of standardized interfaces lead to redundant processing overhead. Furthermore, many prior approaches are constrained by dataset-specific dependencies, limiting their applicability across diverse video domains. To address these challenges, we introduce AIGVE-Tool (AI-Generated Video Evaluation Toolkit), a unified framework that provides a structured and extensible evaluation pipeline for a comprehensive AI-generated video evaluation. Organized within a novel five-category taxonomy, AIGVE-Tool integrates multiple evaluation methodologies while allowing flexible customization through a modular configuration system.

Existing methods frequently encounter difficulties maintaining facial coherence due to misalignments between facial landmarks extracted from driving videos that provide head pose and expression cues and the facial geometry of the reference images. To address this limitation, we introduce the Facial Landmarks Transformation (FLT) method, which leverages a 3D Morphable Model to address this limitation. FLT converts 2D landmarks into a 3D face model, adjusts the 3D face model to align with the reference identity, and then transforms them back into 2D landmarks to guide the image-to-video generation process. This approach ensures accurate alignment with the reference facial geometry, enhancing the consistency between generated videos and reference images. Experimental results demonstrate that FLT effectively preserves facial identity, significantly improving pose-guided character animation models.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025.

Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images.

In practice TVP methods focus on a particular category of videos depicting manipulations of objects carried out by human beings or robot arms. Previous methods adapt models pre-trained on text-to-image tasks, and thus tend to generate video that lacks the required continuity. A natural progression would be to leverage more recent pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) models. This approach is rendered more challenging by the fact that the most common fine-tuning technique, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), yields undesirable results. In this work, we propose an adaptation-based strategy we label Frame-wise Conditioning Adaptation (FCA). Within the module, we devise a sub-module that produces frame-wise text embeddings from the input text, which acts as an additional text condition to aid generation. We use FCA to fine-tune the T2V model, which incorporates the initial frame(s) as an extra condition. We compare and discuss the more effective strategy for injecting such embeddings into the T2V model. We conduct extensive ablation studies on our design choices with quantitative and qualitative performance analysis. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art for the task of TVP.

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving World Model named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Existing training-free video generation techniques, learning motion dynamics on the frame-by-frame basis, often produce poor results with noticeable motion interruptions and misaligments. To address these issues, we propose AUTV, a framework for synthesizing marine video data with pixel-wise annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by constructing two video datasets, namely UTV, a real-world dataset comprising 2,000 video-text pairs, and SUTV, a synthetic video dataset including 10,000 videos with segmentation masks for marine objects. UTV provides diverse underwater videos with comprehensive annotations including appearance, texture, camera intrinsics, lighting, and animal behavior. SUTV can be used to improve underwater downstream tasks, which are demonstrated in video inpainting and video object segmentation.</p></details> | under review |

However, they exhibit poor performance when confronted with sparse inputs, primarily due to the sparse distribution of Gaussian points and insufficient view supervision. To relieve these challenges, we propose SPC-GS, leveraging Scene-layout-based Gaussian Initialization (SGI) and Semantic-Prompt Consistency (SPC) Regularization for open-world free view synthesis with sparse inputs. Specifically, SGI provides a dense, scene-layout-based Gaussian distribution by utilizing view-changed images generated from the video generation model and view-constraint Gaussian points densification. Additionally, SPC mitigates limited view supervision by employing semantic-prompt-based consistency constraints developed by SAM2. This approach leverages available semantics from training views, serving as instructive prompts, to optimize visually overlapping regions in novel views with 2D and 3D consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SPC-GS across Replica and ScanNet benchmarks. Notably, our SPC-GS achieves a 3.06 dB gain in PSNR for reconstruction quality and a 7.3% improvement in mIoU for open-world semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025.

Specifically, there are two key issues: 1) current motion metrics do not fully align with human perceptions; 2) the existing motion prompts are limited. Based on these findings, we introduce VMBench--a comprehensive Video Motion Benchmark that has perception-aligned motion metrics and features the most diverse types of motion. VMBench has several appealing properties: 1) Perception-Driven Motion Evaluation Metrics, we identify five dimensions based on human perception in motion video assessment and develop fine-grained evaluation metrics, providing deeper insights into models' strengths and weaknesses in motion quality. 2) Meta-Guided Motion Prompt Generation, a structured method that extracts meta-information, generates diverse motion prompts with LLMs, and refines them through human-AI validation, resulting in a multi-level prompt library covering six key dynamic scene dimensions. 3) Human-Aligned Validation Mechanism, we provide human preference annotations to validate our benchmarks, with our metrics achieving an average 35.3% improvement in Spearman's correlation over baseline methods. This is the first time that the quality of motion in videos has been evaluated from the perspective of human perception alignment. Additionally, we will soon release VMBench at https://github.com/GD-AIGC/VMBench, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing motion generation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PersonalVideo: High ID-Fidelity Video Customization without Dynamic and Semantic Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17048v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current text-to-video (T2V) generation has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic general videos, but it is still under-explored in identity-specific human video generation with customized ID images. The key challenge lies in maintaining high ID fidelity consistently while preserving the original motion dynamic and semantic following after the identity injection. Current video identity customization methods mainly rely on reconstructing given identity images on text-to-image models, which have a divergent distribution with the T2V model. This process introduces a tuning-inference gap, leading to dynamic and semantic degradation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework, dubbed $\textbf{PersonalVideo}$, that applies a mixture of reward supervision on synthesized videos instead of the simple reconstruction objective on images. Specifically, we first incorporate identity consistency reward to effectively inject the reference's identity without the tuning-inference gap. Then we propose a novel semantic consistency reward to align the semantic distribution of the generated videos with the original T2V model, which preserves its dynamic and semantic following capability during the identity injection. With the non-reconstructive reward training, we further employ simulated prompt augmentation to reduce overfitting by supervising generated results in more semantic scenarios, gaining good robustness even with only a single reference image. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in delivering high identity faithfulness while preserving the inherent video generation qualities of the original T2V model, outshining prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pyramidal Flow Matching for Efficient Video Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05954v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation requires modeling a vast spatiotemporal space, which demands significant computational resources and data usage. To reduce the complexity, the prevailing approaches employ a cascaded architecture to avoid direct training with full resolution latent. Despite reducing computational demands, the separate optimization of each sub-stage hinders knowledge sharing and sacrifices flexibility. This work introduces a unified pyramidal flow matching algorithm. It reinterprets the original denoising trajectory as a series of pyramid stages, where only the final stage operates at the full resolution, thereby enabling more efficient video generative modeling. Through our sophisticated design, the flows of different pyramid stages can be interlinked to maintain continuity. Moreover, we craft autoregressive video generation with a temporal pyramid to compress the full-resolution history. The entire framework can be optimized in an end-to-end manner and with a single unified Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method supports generating high-quality 5-second (up to 10-second) videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS within 20.7k A100 GPU training hours.

Toward this goal, we introduce an audio-to-video generation framework for creating Real Time/cine-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (RT-/cine-MRI) visuals of the vocal tract from speech signals. Our framework first preprocesses RT-/cine-MRI sequences and speech samples to achieve temporal alignment, ensuring synchronization between visual and audio data. We then employ a modified stable diffusion model, integrating structural and temporal blocks, to effectively capture movement characteristics and temporal dynamics in the synchronized data. This process enables the generation of MRI sequences from new speech inputs, improving the conversion of audio into visual data. We evaluated our framework on healthy controls and tongue cancer patients by analyzing and comparing the vocal tract movements in synthesized videos. Our framework demonstrated adaptability to new speech inputs and effective generalization. In addition, positive human evaluations confirmed its effectiveness, with realistic and accurate visualizations, suggesting its potential for outpatient therapy and personalized simulation of vocal tract visualizations.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we introduce two geometric reward functions for 3D/4D scene generation by using pose-free feed-forward scene reconstruction models.

Unlike existing methods that rely on iterative depth estimation and image inpainting, often leading to geometric distortions and inconsistencies, WonderVerse leverages the powerful world-level priors embedded within video generative foundation models to create highly immersive and geometrically coherent 3D environments. Furthermore, we propose a new technique for controllable 3D scene extension to substantially increase the scale of the generated environments. Besides, we introduce a novel abnormal sequence detection module that utilizes camera trajectory to address geometric inconsistency in the generated videos. Finally, WonderVerse is compatible with various 3D reconstruction methods, allowing both efficient and high-quality generation. Extensive experiments on 3D scene generation demonstrate that our WonderVerse, with an elegant and simple pipeline, delivers extendable and highly-realistic 3D scenes, markedly outperforming existing works that rely on more complex architectures.</p></details> |  |

These models can distort embedded watermarks during editing, posing significant challenges to copyright protection. In this work, we introduce W-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of watermarking methods against a wide range of image editing techniques, including image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation. Through extensive evaluations of eleven representative watermarking methods against prevalent editing techniques, we demonstrate that most methods fail to detect watermarks after such edits. To address this limitation, we propose VINE, a watermarking method that significantly enhances robustness against various image editing techniques while maintaining high image quality. Our approach involves two key innovations: (1) we analyze the frequency characteristics of image editing and identify that blurring distortions exhibit similar frequency properties, which allows us to use them as surrogate attacks during training to bolster watermark robustness; (2) we leverage a large-scale pretrained diffusion model SDXL-Turbo, adapting it for the watermarking task to achieve more imperceptible and robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that our method achieves outstanding watermarking performance under various image editing techniques, outperforming existing methods in both image quality and robustness.

However, altering camera trajectories of a given video remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation. It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories. The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video conditioning mechanism -- its capability often overlooked in current research. To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5, which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics, covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments tell that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines. Our method also finds promising applications in video stabilization, super-resolution, and outpainting.

| **[High Quality Diffusion Distillation on a Single GPU with Relative and Absolute Position Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20744v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce relative and absolute position matching (RAPM), a diffusion distillation method resulting in high quality generation that can be trained efficiently on a single GPU. Recent diffusion distillation research has achieved excellent results for high-resolution text-to-image generation with methods such as phased consistency models (PCM) and improved distribution matching distillation (DMD2). However, these methods generally require many GPUs (e.g.~8-64) and significant batchsizes (e.g.~128-2048) during training, resulting in memory and compute requirements that are beyond the resources of some researchers. RAPM provides effective single-GPU diffusion distillation training with a batchsize of 1. The new method attempts to mimic the sampling trajectories of the teacher model by matching the relative and absolute positions. The design of relative positions is inspired by PCM. Two discriminators are introduced accordingly in RAPM, one for matching relative positions and the other for absolute positions. Experimental results on StableDiffusion (SD) V1.5 and SDXL indicate that RAPM with 4 timesteps produces comparable FID scores as the best method with 1 timestep under very limited computational resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[A weakly-supervised deep learning model for fast localisation and delineation of the skeleton, internal organs, and spinal canal on Whole-Body Diffusion-Weighted MRI (WB-DWI)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20722v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values and Total Diffusion Volume (TDV) from Whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI (WB-DWI) are recognized cancer imaging biomarkers. However, manual disease delineation for ADC and TDV measurements is unfeasible in clinical practice, demanding automation. As a first step, we propose an algorithm to generate fast and reproducible probability maps of the skeleton, adjacent internal organs (liver, spleen, urinary bladder, and kidneys), and spinal canal. Methods: We developed an automated deep-learning pipeline based on a 3D patch-based Residual U-Net architecture that localizes and delineates these anatomical structures on WB-DWI. The algorithm was trained using "soft-labels" (non-binary segmentations) derived from a computationally intensive atlas-based approach. For training and validation, we employed a multi-center WB-DWI dataset comprising 532 scans from patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer (APC) or Multiple Myeloma (MM), with testing on 45 patients. Results: Our weakly-supervised deep learning model achieved an average dice score/precision/recall of 0.66/0.6/0.73 for skeletal delineations, 0.8/0.79/0.81 for internal organs, and 0.85/0.79/0.94 for spinal canal, with surface distances consistently below 3 mm. Relative median ADC and log-transformed volume differences between automated and manual expert-defined full-body delineations were below 10% and 4%, respectively. The computational time for generating probability maps was 12x faster than the atlas-based registration algorithm (25 s vs. 5 min). An experienced radiologist rated the model's accuracy "good" or "excellent" on test datasets. Conclusion: Our model offers fast and reproducible probability maps for localizing and delineating body regions on WB-DWI, enabling ADC and TDV quantification, potentially supporting clinicians in disease staging and treatment response assessment.</p></details> |  |

While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for simple manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g., the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when handling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce DexHandDiff, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive dexterous manipulation. DexHandDiff models joint state-action dynamics through a dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact alignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive generalizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics model-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated guidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical interactions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues. Experiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block re-orientation, object relocation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexHandDiff's effectiveness on goals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves an average of 70.7% success rate on goal adaptive dexterous tasks, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

While in this paper, we investigate the capability of GenAI for text-to-model generation, to see whether GenAI can comprehend hyper-level knowledge embedded within AI itself parameters. Specifically, we study a practical scenario termed train-once-for-all personalization, aiming to generate personalized models for diverse end-users and tasks using text prompts. Inspired by the recent emergence of neural network diffusion, we present Tina, a text-conditioned neural network diffusion for train-once-for-all personalization. Tina leverages a diffusion transformer model conditioned on task descriptions embedded using a CLIP model. Despite the astronomical number of potential personalized tasks (e.g., $1.73\times10^{13}$), by our design, Tina demonstrates remarkable in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization even trained on small datasets ($\sim 1000$). We further verify whether and how \Tina understands world knowledge by analyzing its capabilities under zero-shot/few-shot image prompts, different numbers of personalized classes, prompts of natural language descriptions, and predicting unseen entities.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, data scarcity caused by atmospheric conditions, seasonal variations, and limited geographical coverage hinders the effective application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in EO. Traditional data augmentation techniques, which rely on basic parameterized image transformations, often fail to introduce sufficient diversity across key semantic axes. These axes include natural changes such as snow and floods, human impacts like urbanization and roads, and disasters such as wildfires and storms, which limits the accuracy of AI models in EO applications. To address this, we propose a four-stage data augmentation approach that integrates diffusion models to enhance semantic diversity. Our method employs meta-prompts for instruction generation, vision-language models for rich captioning, EO-specific diffusion model fine-tuning, and iterative data augmentation. Extensive experiments using four augmentation techniques demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms established methods, generating semantically diverse EO images and improving AI model performance.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures |

Semantic watermarks, such as Tree-Rings and Gaussian Shading, represent a novel class of watermarking techniques that are easy to implement and highly robust against various perturbations. However, our work demonstrates a fundamental security vulnerability of semantic watermarks. We show that attackers can leverage unrelated models, even with different latent spaces and architectures (UNet vs DiT), to perform powerful and realistic forgery attacks. Specifically, we design two watermark forgery attacks. The first imprints a targeted watermark into real images by manipulating the latent representation of an arbitrary image in an unrelated LDM to get closer to the latent representation of a watermarked image. We also show that this technique can be used for watermark removal. The second attack generates new images with the target watermark by inverting a watermarked image and re-generating it with an arbitrary prompt. Both attacks just need a single reference image with the target watermark. Overall, our findings question the applicability of semantic watermarks by revealing that attackers can easily forge or remove these watermarks under realistic conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 22 figures, 8 tables, to be published in The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 (CVPR)</p></details> |

While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation.

They are handy for tasks in the image domain, where the quality of the explanations benefits from recent advances in generative models. Although counterfactual explanations have been widely applied to classification models, their application to regression tasks remains underexplored. We present two methods to create counterfactual explanations for image regression tasks using diffusion-based generative models to address challenges in sparsity and quality: 1) one based on a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model that operates directly in pixel-space and 2) another based on a Diffusion Autoencoder operating in latent space. Both produce realistic, semantic, and smooth counterfactuals on CelebA-HQ and a synthetic data set, providing easily interpretable insights into the decision-making process of the regression model and reveal spurious correlations. We find that for regression counterfactuals, changes in features depend on the region of the predicted value. Large semantic changes are needed for significant changes in predicted values, making it harder to find sparse counterfactuals than with classifiers. Moreover, pixel space counterfactuals are more sparse while latent space counterfactuals are of higher quality and allow bigger semantic changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 5 Figures, Accepted at 3rd World Conference on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI-2025), Code and reproduction instructions available on GitHub, see https://github.com/DevinTDHa/Diffusion-Counterfactuals-for-Image-Regressors</p></details> |

We begin by proving that the time-marginal distribution of the sum of two independent diffusion processes satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation. Building on this result and applying Ambrosio-Figalli-Trevisan's superposition principle, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the associated stochastic differential equation (SDE). Leveraging these theoretical foundations, we develop a method to construct (stochastic) transport maps between arbitrary probability distributions using dynamical ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and SDEs. Furthermore, we introduce a unified framework that generalizes and extends a broad class of diffusion-based generative models and sampling techniques. Finally, we analyze the convergence properties of particle approximations for the SDEs underlying our framework, providing theoretical guarantees for their practical implementation. This work bridges theoretical insights with practical applications, offering new tools for generative modeling and sampling in high-dimensional spaces.</p></details> | 34 pages |

White matter (WM) hypointensities in T1-weighted imaging, such as those arising from multiple sclerosis or small vessel disease, are known to affect the output of brain segmentation methods and therefore bias cortical thickness measurements. These effects are well-documented among traditional brain segmentation tools but have not been studied extensively in tools based on deep-learning segmentations, which promise to be more robust. In this paper, we explore the potential of deep learning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cortical thickness measurement in the presence of WM lesions, using a high-quality lesion filling algorithm leveraging denoising diffusion networks. A pseudo-3D U-Net architecture trained on the OASIS dataset to generate synthetic healthy tissue, conditioned on binary lesion masks derived from the MSSEG dataset, allows realistic removal of white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis patients. By applying morphometry methods to patient images before and after lesion filling, we analysed robustness of global and regional cortical thickness measurements in the presence of white matter lesions. Methods based on a deep learning-based segmentation of the brain (Fastsurfer, DL+DiReCT, ANTsPyNet) exhibited greater robustness than those using classical segmentation methods (Freesurfer, ANTs).</p></details> |  |

However, they are often criticized for two significant problems: 1) slow training and inference speed, and 2) inadequate recovery of fine-grained facial details. To address these problems, we propose a novel Truncated Diffusion model for efficient Blind Face Restoration (TD-BFR), a three-stage paradigm tailored for the progressive resolution of degraded images. Specifically, TD-BFR utilizes an innovative truncated sampling method, starting from low-quality (LQ) images at low resolution to enhance sampling speed, and then introduces an adaptive degradation removal module to handle unknown degradations and connect the generation processes across different resolutions. Additionally, we further adapt the priors of pre-trained diffusion models to recover rich facial details. Our method efficiently restores high-quality images in a coarse-to-fine manner and experimental results demonstrate that TD-BFR is, on average, \textbf{4.75$\times$} faster than current state-of-the-art diffusion-based BFR methods while maintaining competitive quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning Guided Latent Diffusion Model for Image-to-Image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20484v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion model has demonstrated superior performance in synthesizing diverse and high-quality images for text-guided image translation. However, there remains room for improvement in both the formulation of text prompts and the preservation of reference image content. First, variations in target text prompts can significantly influence the quality of the generated images, and it is often challenging for users to craft an optimal prompt that fully captures the content of the input image. Second, while existing models can introduce desired modifications to specific regions of the reference image, they frequently induce unintended alterations in areas that should remain unchanged. To address these challenges, we propose pix2pix-zeroCon, a zero-shot diffusion-based method that eliminates the need for additional training by leveraging patch-wise contrastive loss. Specifically, we automatically determine the editing direction in the text embedding space based on the reference image and target prompts. Furthermore, to ensure precise content and structural preservation in the edited image, we introduce cross-attention guiding loss and patch-wise contrastive loss between the generated and original image embeddings within a pre-trained diffusion model. Notably, our approach requires no additional training and operates directly on a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing models in image-to-image translation, achieving enhanced fidelity and controllability.</p></details> | 11 pages, 13 figures |

However, despite their high-quality outputs, these models often perpetuate social biases, including those related to gender and race. These biases can potentially contribute to harmful real-world consequences, reinforcing stereotypes and exacerbating inequalities in various social contexts. While existing research on diffusion bias mitigation has predominantly focused on guiding content generation, it often neglects the intrinsic mechanisms within diffusion models that causally drive biased outputs. In this paper, we investigate the internal processes of diffusion models, identifying specific decision-making mechanisms, termed bias features, embedded within the model architecture. By directly manipulating these features, our method precisely isolates and adjusts the elements responsible for bias generation, permitting granular control over the bias levels in the generated content. Through experiments on both unconditional and conditional diffusion models across various social bias attributes, we demonstrate our method's efficacy in managing generation distribution while preserving image quality. We also dissect the discovered model mechanism, revealing different intrinsic features controlling fine-grained aspects of generation, boosting further research on mechanistic interpretability of diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project Page: https://foundation-model-research.github.io/difflens</p></details> |
| **[Latent Beam Diffusion Models for Decoding Image Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20429v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from text prompts, they struggle with visual consistency in image sequences. Existing methods generate each image independently, leading to disjointed narratives - a challenge further exacerbated in non-linear storytelling, where scenes must connect beyond adjacent frames. We introduce a novel beam search strategy for latent space exploration, enabling conditional generation of full image sequences with beam search decoding. Unlike prior approaches that use fixed latent priors, our method dynamically searches for an optimal sequence of latent representations, ensuring coherent visual transitions. To address beam search's quadratic complexity, we integrate a cross-attention mechanism that efficiently scores search paths and enables pruning, prioritizing alignment with both textual prompts and visual context. Human evaluations confirm that our approach outperforms baseline methods, producing full sequences with superior coherence, visual continuity, and textual alignment. By bridging advances in search optimization and latent space refinement, this work sets a new standard for structured image sequence generation.</p></details> |  |

The IVTON task involves seamlessly superimposing a garment from one image onto a person in another, creating a realistic depiction of the person wearing the specified garment. Unlike conventional diffusion-based virtual try-on models that depend on large pre-trained U-Net architectures, ITA-MDT leverages a lightweight, scalable transformer-based denoising diffusion model with a mask latent modeling scheme, achieving competitive results while reducing computational overhead. A key component of ITA-MDT is the Image-Timestep Adaptive Feature Aggregator (ITAFA), a dynamic feature aggregator that combines all of the features from the image encoder into a unified feature of the same size, guided by diffusion timestep and garment image complexity. This enables adaptive weighting of features, allowing the model to emphasize either global information or fine-grained details based on the requirements of the denoising stage. Additionally, the Salient Region Extractor (SRE) module is presented to identify complex region of the garment to provide high-resolution local information to the denoising model as an additional condition alongside the global information of the full garment image. This targeted conditioning strategy enhances detail preservation of fine details in highly salient garment regions, optimizing computational resources by avoiding unnecessarily processing entire garment image. Comparative evaluations confirms that ITA-MDT improves efficiency while maintaining strong performance, reaching state-of-the-art results in several metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://jiwoohong93.github.io/ita-mdt/</p></details> |

However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; 21 pages, 23 figures, Project page: https://onevfall.github.io/project_page/ditctrl ; GitHub repository: https://github.com/TencentARC/DiTCtrl</p></details> |

Recent diffusion-based methods show impressive performance in 3D robotic manipulation tasks, whereas they suffer from severe runtime inefficiency due to multiple denoising steps, especially with high-dimensional observations. To this end, we propose a real-time robotic manipulation model named ManiCM that imposes the consistency constraint to the diffusion process, so that the model can generate robot actions in only one-step inference. Specifically, we formulate a consistent diffusion process in the robot action space conditioned on the point cloud input, where the original action is required to be directly denoised from any point along the ODE trajectory. To model this process, we design a consistency distillation technique to predict the action sample directly instead of predicting the noise within the vision community for fast convergence in the low-dimensional action manifold. We evaluate ManiCM on 31 robotic manipulation tasks from Adroit and Metaworld, and the results demonstrate that our approach accelerates the state-of-the-art method by 10 times in average inference speed while maintaining competitive average success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://manicm-fast.github.io/</p></details> |

Previous video generation models often had limited movement and short durations, and is difficult to generate videos with coherent narratives based on text. We propose several designs to address these issues. First, we propose a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions, to improve both compression rate and video fidelity. Second, to improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the two modalities. Third, by employing a progressive training and multi-resolution frame pack technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration, different shape videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method, greatly contributing to the generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show that CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple machine metrics and human evaluations.

Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://agnjason.github.io/HumanDiT-page/</p></details> |
| **[RelTriple: Learning Plausible Indoor Layouts by Integrating Relationship Triples into the Diffusion Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20289v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of indoor furniture layouts has significant applications in augmented reality, smart homes, and architectural design. Successful furniture arrangement requires proper physical relationships (e.g., collision avoidance) and spacing relationships between furniture and their functional zones to be respected. However, manually defined relationships are almost always incomplete and can produce unrealistic layouts. This work instead extracts spacing relationships automatically based on a hierarchical analysis and adopts the Delaunay Triangulation to produce important triple relationships. Compared to pairwise relationship modeling, triple relationships account for interactions and space utilization among multiple objects. To this end, we introduce RelTriple, a novel approach that enhances furniture distribution by learning spacing relationships between objects and regions. We formulate triple relationships as object-to-object (O2O) losses and object-to-region (O2R) losses and integrate them directly into the training process of generative diffusion. Our approach consistently improves over existing state-of-the-art methods in visual results evaluation metrics on unconditional layout generation, floorplan-conditioned layout generation, and scene rearrangement, achieving at least 12% on the introduced spatial relationship metric and superior spatial coherence and practical usability.</p></details> |  |

Although significant progress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all methods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context utilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower generation speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (Dynamic frame Avatar With Non-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once generation of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two main components: (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the latent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid videos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements. Additionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation capabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These results highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the field of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks further exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models.

While event cameras can capture high temporal resolution motion information, existing event-based VFI methods struggle with limited training data and complex motion patterns. In this paper, we introduce Event-Guided Video Diffusion Model (EGVD), a novel framework that leverages the powerful priors of pre-trained stable video diffusion models alongside the precise temporal information from event cameras. Our approach features a Multi-modal Motion Condition Generator (MMCG) that effectively integrates RGB frames and event signals to guide the diffusion process, producing physically realistic intermediate frames. We employ a selective fine-tuning strategy that preserves spatial modeling capabilities while efficiently incorporating event-guided temporal information. We incorporate input-output normalization techniques inspired by recent advances in diffusion modeling to enhance training stability across varying noise levels. To improve generalization, we construct a comprehensive dataset combining both real and simulated event data across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on both real and simulated datasets demonstrate that EGVD significantly outperforms existing methods in handling large motion and challenging lighting conditions, achieving substantial improvements in perceptual quality metrics (27.4% better LPIPS on Prophesee and 24.1% on BSRGB) while maintaining competitive fidelity measures.

We study diffusions on the circle, namely the Brownian motion on the circle and the von Mises process, and consider these as models for correlation. The von Mises process was proposed in Kent (1975) as a probabilistic justification for the von Mises distribution which is widely used in Circular statistics. The transition density of the von Mises process has been unknown, we identify an approximate analytic transition density for the von Mises process. We discuss the estimation of these diffusion models and a stochastic correlation model in finance.

Improving Conditional Generation of Fine-Tuned Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20240v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a fundamental technique in training conditional diffusion models. The common practice for CFG-based training is to use a single network to learn both conditional and unconditional noise prediction, with a small dropout rate for conditioning. However, we observe that the joint learning of unconditional noise with limited bandwidth in training results in poor priors for the unconditional case. More importantly, these poor unconditional noise predictions become a serious reason for degrading the quality of conditional generation. Inspired by the fact that most CFG-based conditional models are trained by fine-tuning a base model with better unconditional generation, we first show that simply replacing the unconditional noise in CFG with that predicted by the base model can significantly improve conditional generation. Furthermore, we show that a diffusion model other than the one the fine-tuned model was trained on can be used for unconditional noise replacement. We experimentally verify our claim with a range of CFG-based conditional models for both image and video generation, including Zero-1-to-3, Versatile Diffusion, DiT, DynamiCrafter, and InstructPix2Pix.</p></details> |  |

The diffusion model is based on its step-by-step denoising generation process. By combining the conditional generation mechanism, design optimization module, and user feedback mechanism, the model can generate a UI interface that meets the requirements based on multimodal inputs such as text descriptions and sketches provided by users. In the study, a complete experimental evaluation framework was designed, and mainstream generation models (such as GAN, VAE, DALL E, etc.) were selected for comparative experiments. The generation results were quantitatively analyzed from indicators such as PSNR, SSIM, and FID. The results show that the model proposed in this study is superior to other models in terms of generation quality and user satisfaction, especially in terms of logical clarity of information transmission and visual aesthetics. The ablation experiment further verifies the key role of conditional generation and design optimization modules in improving interface quality. This study provides a new technical path for UI design automation and lays the foundation for the intelligent and personalized development of human-computer interaction interfaces. In the future, the application potential of the model in virtual reality, game design, and other fields will be further explored.</p></details> |  |

While skills in offline RL are predominantly modeled within a continuous latent space, the potential of discrete skill spaces remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a compact discrete skill space for offline RL tasks supported by state-of-the-art transformer-based encoder and diffusion-based decoder. Coupled with a high-level policy trained via offline RL techniques, our method establishes a hierarchical RL framework where the trained diffusion decoder plays a pivotal role. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm, Discrete Diffusion Skill (DDS), is a powerful offline RL method. DDS performs competitively on Locomotion and Kitchen tasks and excels on long-horizon tasks, achieving at least a 12 percent improvement on AntMaze-v2 benchmarks compared to existing offline RL approaches. Furthermore, DDS offers improved interpretability, training stability, and online exploration compared to previous skill-based methods.</p></details> |  |

In continuous state-spaces, controllable and flexible generation of samples with desired properties has been realized using guidance on diffusion and flow models. However, these guidance approaches are not readily amenable to discrete state-space models. Consequently, we introduce a general and principled method for applying guidance on such models. Our method depends on leveraging continuous-time Markov processes on discrete state-spaces, which unlocks computational tractability for sampling from a desired guided distribution. We demonstrate the utility of our approach, Discrete Guidance, on a range of applications including guided generation of small-molecules, DNA sequences and protein sequences.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that images synthesized by 2D diffusion models inherently capture plausible and realistic OOR cues, enabling efficient ways to collect a 3D dataset to learn OOR for various unbounded object categories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse images that capture plausible OOR cues, which we then uplift into 3D samples. Leveraging our diverse collection of plausible 3D samples for the object pairs, we train a score-based OOR diffusion model to learn the distribution of their relative spatial relationships. Additionally, we extend our pairwise OOR to multi-object OOR by enforcing consistency across pairwise relations and preventing object collisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our method across various object-object spatial relationships, along with its applicability to real-world 3D scene arrangement tasks using the OOR diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tlb-miss.github.io/oor/</p></details> |

Existing methods lack a systematic way to reliably extract the interpretable underlying intrinsic concepts. To address this challenge, we present ICE, short for Intrinsic Concept Extraction, a novel framework that exclusively utilizes a T2I model to automatically and systematically extract intrinsic concepts from a single image. ICE consists of two pivotal stages. In the first stage, ICE devises an automatic concept localization module to pinpoint relevant text-based concepts and their corresponding masks within the image. This critical stage streamlines concept initialization and provides precise guidance for subsequent analysis. The second stage delves deeper into each identified mask, decomposing the object-level concepts into intrinsic concepts and general concepts. This decomposition allows for a more granular and interpretable breakdown of visual elements. Our framework demonstrates superior performance on intrinsic concept extraction from a single image in an unsupervised manner.

However, without additional guidance, the large motion between frames makes this problem ill-posed. Event-based Video Frame Interpolation (EVFI) addresses this challenge by using sparse, high-temporal-resolution event measurements as motion guidance. This guidance allows EVFI methods to significantly outperform frame-only methods. However, to date, EVFI methods have relied on a limited set of paired event-frame training data, severely limiting their performance and generalization capabilities. In this work, we overcome the limited data challenge by adapting pre-trained video diffusion models trained on internet-scale datasets to EVFI. We experimentally validate our approach on real-world EVFI datasets, including a new one that we introduce.

Although this evolution has significantly enhanced the models' ability to understand complex prompts and generate text, it also leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters. Despite T5 series encoders being trained on the C4 natural language corpus, which includes a significant amount of non-visual data, diffusion models with T5 encoder do not respond to those non-visual prompts, indicating redundancy in representational power. Therefore, it raises an important question: "Do we really need such a large text encoder?" In pursuit of an answer, we employ vision-based knowledge distillation to train a series of T5 encoder models. To fully inherit its capabilities, we constructed our dataset based on three criteria: image quality, semantic understanding, and text-rendering. Our results demonstrate the scaling down pattern that the distilled T5-base model can generate images of comparable quality to those produced by T5-XXL, while being 50 times smaller in size. This reduction in model size significantly lowers the GPU requirements for running state-of-the-art models such as FLUX and SD3, making high-quality text-to-image generation more accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, the more challenging task of multi-scene video generation, which offers broader applications, remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Mask$^2$DiT, a novel approach that establishes fine-grained, one-to-one alignment between video segments and their corresponding text annotations. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric binary mask at each attention layer within the DiT architecture, ensuring that each text annotation applies exclusively to its respective video segment while preserving temporal coherence across visual tokens. This attention mechanism enables precise segment-level textual-to-visual alignment, allowing the DiT architecture to effectively handle video generation tasks with a fixed number of scenes. To further equip the DiT architecture with the ability to generate additional scenes based on existing ones, we incorporate a segment-level conditional mask, which conditions each newly generated segment on the preceding video segments, thereby enabling auto-regressive scene extension. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm that Mask$^2$DiT excels in maintaining visual consistency across segments while ensuring semantic alignment between each segment and its corresponding text description.

| **[Aesthetic Post-Training Diffusion Models from Generic Preferences with Step-by-step Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04314v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating visually appealing images is fundamental to modern text-to-image generation models. A potential solution to better aesthetics is direct preference optimization (DPO), which has been applied to diffusion models to improve general image quality including prompt alignment and aesthetics. Popular DPO methods propagate preference labels from clean image pairs to all the intermediate steps along the two generation trajectories. However, preference labels provided in existing datasets are blended with layout and aesthetic opinions, which would disagree with aesthetic preference. Even if aesthetic labels were provided (at substantial cost), it would be hard for the two-trajectory methods to capture nuanced visual differences at different steps. To improve aesthetics economically, this paper uses existing generic preference data and introduces step-by-step preference optimization (SPO) that discards the propagation strategy and allows fine-grained image details to be assessed. Specifically, at each denoising step, we 1) sample a pool of candidates by denoising from a shared noise latent, 2) use a step-aware preference model to find a suitable win-lose pair to supervise the diffusion model, and 3) randomly select one from the pool to initialize the next denoising step. This strategy ensures that diffusion models focus on the subtle, fine-grained visual differences instead of layout aspect. We find that aesthetics can be significantly enhanced by accumulating these improved minor differences. When fine-tuning Stable Diffusion v1.5 and SDXL, SPO yields significant improvements in aesthetics compared with existing DPO methods while not sacrificing image-text alignment compared with vanilla models. Moreover, SPO converges much faster than DPO methods due to the use of more correct preference labels provided by the step-aware preference model.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Recognizing the success of diffusion models and the significance of emotion, we investigate a previously overlooked risk associated with text-to-image diffusion models, that is, utilizing emotion in the input texts to introduce negative content and provoke unfavorable emotions in users. Specifically, we identify a new backdoor attack, i.e., emotion-aware backdoor attack (EmoAttack), which introduces malicious negative content triggered by emotional texts during image generation. We formulate such an attack as a diffusion personalization problem to avoid extensive model retraining and propose the EmoBooth. Unlike existing personalization methods, our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained diffusion model by establishing a mapping between a cluster of emotional words and a given reference image containing malicious negative content. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we built a dataset and conducted extensive analysis and discussion about its effectiveness. Given consumers' widespread use of diffusion models, uncovering this threat is critical for society.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unpaired Object-Level SAR-to-Optical Image Translation for Aircraft with Keypoints-Guided Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19798v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery provides all-weather, all-day, and high-resolution imaging capabilities but its unique imaging mechanism makes interpretation heavily reliant on expert knowledge, limiting interpretability, especially in complex target tasks. Translating SAR images into optical images is a promising solution to enhance interpretation and support downstream tasks. Most existing research focuses on scene-level translation, with limited work on object-level translation due to the scarcity of paired data and the challenge of accurately preserving contour and texture details. To address these issues, this study proposes a keypoint-guided diffusion model (KeypointDiff) for SAR-to-optical image translation of unpaired aircraft targets. This framework introduces supervision on target class and azimuth angle via keypoints, along with a training strategy for unpaired data. Based on the classifier-free guidance diffusion architecture, a class-angle guidance module (CAGM) is designed to integrate class and angle information into the diffusion generation process. Furthermore, adversarial loss and consistency loss are employed to improve image fidelity and detail quality, tailored for aircraft targets. During sampling, aided by a pre-trained keypoint detector, the model eliminates the requirement for manually labeled class and azimuth information, enabling automated SAR-to-optical translation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across multiple metrics, providing an efficient and effective solution for object-level SAR-to-optical translation and downstream tasks. Moreover, the method exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to untrained aircraft types with the assistance of the keypoint detector.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose FADE (Fine grained Attenuation for Diffusion Erasure), introducing adjacency aware unlearning in diffusion models. FADE comprises two components: (1) the Concept Neighborhood, which identifies an adjacency set of related concepts, and (2) Mesh Modules, employing a structured combination of Expungement, Adjacency, and Guidance loss components. These enable precise erasure of target concepts while preserving fidelity across related and unrelated concepts. Evaluated on datasets like Stanford Dogs, Oxford Flowers, CUB, I2P, Imagenette, and ImageNet1k, FADE effectively removes target concepts with minimal impact on correlated concepts, achieving atleast a 12% improvement in retention performance over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

While image diffusion models have shown remarkable restoration capabilities, their direct application to video leads to temporal inconsistencies, and existing video restoration methods require extensive retraining for different degradation types. Our approach addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a hierarchical latent warping strategy that maintains consistency across both keyframes and local frames, and a hybrid token merging mechanism that adaptively combines optical flow and feature matching. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only maintains the high-quality restoration of base diffusion models but also achieves superior temporal consistency across diverse datasets and degradation conditions, including challenging scenarios like 8$\times$ super-resolution and severe noise. Importantly, our framework works with any image restoration diffusion model, providing a versatile solution for video enhancement without task-specific training or modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jimmycv07.github.io/DiffIR2VR_web/</p></details> |
| **[Localized Concept Erasure for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using Training-Free Gated Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12356v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning based concept erasing has demonstrated promising results in preventing generation of harmful contents from text-to-image diffusion models by removing target concepts while preserving remaining concepts. To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dita: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19757v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent vision-language-action models trained on diverse robot datasets exhibit promising generalization capabilities with limited in-domain data, their reliance on compact action heads to predict discretized or continuous actions constrains adaptability to heterogeneous action spaces. We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning.

| **[PCM : Picard Consistency Model for Fast Parallel Sampling of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19731v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have achieved significant advances in vision, text, and robotics. However, they still face slow generation speeds due to sequential denoising processes. To address this, a parallel sampling method based on Picard iteration was introduced, effectively reducing sequential steps while ensuring exact convergence to the original output. Nonetheless, Picard iteration does not guarantee faster convergence, which can still result in slow generation in practice. In this work, we propose a new parallelization scheme, the Picard Consistency Model (PCM), which significantly reduces the number of generation steps in Picard iteration. Inspired by the consistency model, PCM is directly trained to predict the fixed-point solution, or the final output, at any stage of the convergence trajectory. Additionally, we introduce a new concept called model switching, which addresses PCM's limitations and ensures exact convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCM achieves up to a 2.71x speedup over sequential sampling and a 1.77x speedup over Picard iteration across various tasks, including image generation and robotic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Manual annotation demands significant resources, faces ethical constraints, and depends heavily on domain expertise. Existing generative models often target single-modality outputs, either images or segmentation masks, failing to address the need for high-quality, simultaneous image-mask generation. Additionally, these models frequently lack adaptable conditioning mechanisms, restricting control over the generated outputs and limiting their applicability for dataset augmentation and rare scenario simulation. We propose CoSimGen, a diffusion-based framework for controllable simultaneous image and mask generation. Conditioning is intuitively achieved through (1) text prompts grounded in class semantics, (2) spatial embedding of context prompts to provide spatial coherence, and (3) spectral embedding of timestep information to model noise levels during diffusion. To enhance controllability and training efficiency, the framework incorporates contrastive triplet loss between text and class embeddings, alongside diffusion and adversarial losses. Initial low-resolution outputs 128 x 128 are super-resolved to 512 x 512, producing high-fidelity images and masks with strict adherence to conditions. We evaluate CoSimGen on metrics such as FID, KID, LPIPS, Class FID, Positive predicted value for image fidelity and semantic alignment of generated samples over 4 diverse datasets. CoSimGen achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets, achieving the lowest KID of 0.11 and LPIPS of 0.53 across datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 14 figure, 2 tables, project page at https://camma-public.github.io/endogen/cosimgen</p></details> |

In response to this challenge, we define a new benchmark, the OpenSDI dataset (OpenSDID), which stands out from existing datasets due to its diverse use of large vision-language models that simulate open-world diffusion-based manipulations. Another outstanding feature of OpenSDID is its inclusion of both detection and localization tasks for images manipulated globally and locally by diffusion models. To address the OpenSDI challenge, we propose a Synergizing Pretrained Models (SPM) scheme to build up a mixture of foundation models. This approach exploits a collaboration mechanism with multiple pretrained foundation models to enhance generalization in the OpenSDI context, moving beyond traditional training by synergizing multiple pretrained models through prompting and attending strategies. Building on this scheme, we introduce MaskCLIP, an SPM-based model that aligns Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) with Masked Autoencoder (MAE). Extensive evaluations on OpenSDID show that MaskCLIP significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for the OpenSDI challenge, achieving remarkable relative improvements of 14.23% in IoU (14.11% in F1) and 2.05% in accuracy (2.38% in F1) compared to the second-best model in localization and detection tasks, respectively.

However, these approaches typically require large quantities of demonstration data paired with corresponding robot action labels, creating a substantial data collection burden. In this work, we propose a plan-then-control framework aimed at improving the action-data efficiency of inverse dynamics controllers by leveraging observational demonstration data. Specifically, we adopt a Deep Koopman Operator framework to model the dynamical system and utilize observation-only trajectories to learn a latent action representation. This latent representation can then be effectively mapped to real high-dimensional continuous actions using a linear action decoder, requiring minimal action-labeled data. Through experiments on simulated robot manipulation tasks and a real robot experiment with multi-modal expert demonstrations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances action-data efficiency and achieves high task success rates with limited action data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

Hierarchical Entropic Diffusion (HED) introduces a structured entropy-based anomaly classification mechanism that systematically tracks fluctuations in entropy evolution to differentiate between benign cryptographic processes and unauthorized encryption attempts. The integration of hierarchical clustering, entropy profiling, and probabilistic diffusion modeling refines detection granularity, ensuring that encryption anomalies are identified despite obfuscation strategies or incremental execution methodologies. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that HED maintained high classification accuracy across diverse ransomware families, outperforming traditional heuristic-based and signature-driven approaches while reducing false positive occurrences. Comparative analysis highlighted that entropy-driven anomaly segmentation improved detection efficiency under variable system workload conditions, ensuring real-time classification feasibility. The computational overhead associated with entropy anomaly detection remained within operational constraints, reinforcing the suitability of entropy-driven classification for large-scale deployment. The ability to identify adversarial entropy manipulations before encryption completion contributes to broader cybersecurity defenses, offering a structured methodology for isolating unauthorized cryptographic activities within heterogeneous computing environments. The results further emphasized that entropy evolution modeling facilitates predictive anomaly detection, enhancing resilience against encryption evasion techniques designed to circumvent traditional detection mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

By introducing a multi-layered diffusion process grounded in spectral analysis, it achieves a complex balance between global and local semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in perplexity and BLEU scores, emphasizing the mechanism's ability to adapt effectively across diverse domains, including multilingual and cross-domain text generation. A rigorous mathematical framework underpins the embedding diffusion process, incorporating weighted adjacency matrices, kernel-based refinements, and dynamic layer-wise normalization. Error distribution analysis reveals that SLED addresses challenges in semantic alignment and coherence, outperforming baseline approaches across varied benchmarks. Scalability studies illustrate that its performance gains are maintained consistently across different model sizes, reflecting a practical balance between computational efficiency and linguistic precision. The implementation also achieves energy efficiency, reducing resource consumption during training and inference phases without compromising accuracy. Qualitative case studies further validate its adaptability to extended narratives and context-intensive scenarios, highlighting the mechanism's potential for real-world applications.

The algorithm is rooted in Bayesian posterior sampling: it combines a likelihood model enforcing fidelity to the reverberant measurement, and an anechoic speech prior implemented by an unconditional diffusion model. We design a parametric filter representing the RIR, with exponential decay for each frequency subband. Room acoustics estimation and speech dereverberation are jointly carried out, as the filter parameters are iteratively estimated and the speech utterance refined along the reverse diffusion trajectory. In a blind scenario where the RIR is unknown, BUDDy successfully performs speech dereverberation in various acoustic scenarios, significantly outperforming other blind unsupervised baselines. Unlike supervised methods, which often struggle to generalize, BUDDy seamlessly adapts to different acoustic conditions. This paper extends our previous work by offering new experimental results and insights into the algorithm's versatility. We demonstrate the robustness of our proposed method to new acoustic and speaker conditions, as well as its adaptability to high-resolution singing voice dereverberation, using both instrumental metrics and subjective listening evaluation. We study BUDDy's performance for RIR estimation and observe it surpasses a state-of-the-art supervised DNN-based estimator on mismatched acoustic conditions. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of informed dereverberation methods to RIR estimation errors, thereby motivating the joint acoustic estimation and dereverberation design.

However, due to compute limitations, each inference with these large models is confined to a small area, making long-range consistent scene generation challenging. To address this, we propose StarGen, a novel framework that employs a pre-trained video diffusion model in an autoregressive manner for long-range scene generation. The generation of each video clip is conditioned on the 3D warping of spatially adjacent images and the temporally overlapping image from previously generated clips, improving spatiotemporal consistency in long-range scene generation with precise pose control. The spatiotemporal condition is compatible with various input conditions, facilitating diverse tasks, including sparse view interpolation, perpetual view generation, and layout-conditioned city generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate StarGen's superior scalability, fidelity, and pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Traditional methods typically extract features from partial point clouds to predict missing regions, but the large solution space often leads to unsatisfactory results. More recent approaches have started to use images as extra guidance, effectively improving performance, but obtaining paired data of images and partial point clouds is challenging in practice. To overcome these limitations, we harness the relatively view-consistent multi-view diffusion priors within large models, to generate novel views of the desired shape. The resulting image set encodes both global and local shape cues, which are especially beneficial for shape completion. To fully exploit the priors, we have designed a shape fusion module for producing an initial complete shape from multi-modality input (i.e.,, images and point clouds), and a follow-up shape consolidation module to obtain the final complete shape by discarding unreliable points introduced by the inconsistency from diffusion priors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our superior performance, especially in recovering fine details.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gsw-d.github.io/PCDreamer/</p></details> |

Existing GAN-based methods suffer from either distortions and visual artifacts or poor reconstruction quality, i.e., the background and several important appearance details, such as hair style/color, glasses and accessories, are not faithfully reconstructed. Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) enable the generation of high-quality realistic images. To this end, in this paper we present DiffusionAct, a novel method that leverages the photo-realistic image generation of diffusion models to perform neural face reenactment. Specifically, we propose to control the semantic space of a Diffusion Autoencoder (DiffAE), in order to edit the facial pose of the input images, defined as the head pose orientation and the facial expressions. Our method allows one-shot, self, and cross-subject reenactment, without requiring subject-specific fine-tuning.

We first formulate the diffusive relaxation system based on the even-odd decomposition method, which allows us to split into one relaxation step and one transport step. We adopt a robust implicit scheme that can be explicitly implemented for the relaxation step that involves the stiffness of the collision term, while the third-order strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method is employed for the transport step. We couple this temporal scheme with the DG method for spatial discretization, which provides additional advantages including high-order accuracy, $h$-$p$ adaptivity, and the ability to handle arbitrary unstructured meshes. A positivity-preserving limiter is further applied to preserve physical properties of numerical solutions. The stability analysis using the even-odd decomposition is conducted for the first time. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of our proposed scheme through several numerical examples.</p></details> |  |

Apart from text-aware human preference scores, we introduce a semantic alignment objective for enhancing the semantic alignment in the early stages of diffusion, relying on the fact that the attention maps are effective reflections of the semantics in noisy images. We propose dynamic scheduling of multiple objectives and intermediate recurrent steps to reflect the requirements at different steps.

However, their iterative denoising nature requires a large number of inference steps to generate a video, which is slow and computationally expensive. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis of the challenges present in existing diffusion distillation methods and propose a novel efficient method, namely AccVideo, to reduce the inference steps for accelerating video diffusion models with synthetic dataset. We leverage the pretrained video diffusion model to generate multiple valid denoising trajectories as our synthetic dataset, which eliminates the use of useless data points during distillation. Based on the synthetic dataset, we design a trajectory-based few-step guidance that utilizes key data points from the denoising trajectories to learn the noise-to-video mapping, enabling video generation in fewer steps. Furthermore, since the synthetic dataset captures the data distribution at each diffusion timestep, we introduce an adversarial training strategy to align the output distribution of the student model with that of our synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing the video quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves 8.5x improvements in generation speed compared to the teacher model while maintaining comparable performance. Compared to previous accelerating methods, our approach is capable of generating videos with higher quality and resolution, i.e., 5-seconds, 720x1280, 24fps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aejion.github.io/accvideo/</p></details> |

Recent methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve enhanced ToF denoising accuracy but tend to struggle when presented with severe noise corruption due to limited prior knowledge of ToF data distribution. In this paper, we propose DepthCAD, a novel ToF denoising approach that ensures global structural smoothness by leveraging the rich prior knowledge in Stable Diffusion and maintains local metric accuracy by steering the diffusion process with confidence guidance. To adopt the pretrained image diffusion model to ToF depth denoising, we apply the diffusion on raw ToF correlation measurements with dynamic range normalization before converting to depth maps. Experimental results validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed scheme, and the evaluation on real data further verifies its robustness against real-world ToF noise.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel speed-up method for diffusion model training, called, which is based on a closer look at time steps. Our key findings are: i) Time steps can be empirically divided into acceleration, deceleration, and convergence areas based on the process increment. ii) These time steps are imbalanced, with many concentrated in the convergence area. iii) The concentrated steps provide limited benefits for diffusion training. To address this, we design an asymmetric sampling strategy that reduces the frequency of steps from the convergence area while increasing the sampling probability for steps from other areas. Additionally, we propose a weighting strategy to emphasize the importance of time steps with rapid-change process increments. As a plug-and-play and architecture-agnostic approach, SpeeD consistently achieves 3-times acceleration across various diffusion architectures, datasets, and tasks. Notably, due to its simple design, our approach significantly reduces the cost of diffusion model training with minimal overhead. Our research enables more researchers to train diffusion models at a lower cost.</p></details> |  |

This phenomenon, known as memorization, may lead to copyright issues. In this study, we propose a method to quantify the ease of reproducing training data in unconditional diffusion models. The average of a sample population following the Langevin equation in the reverse diffusion process moves according to a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE establishes a 1-to-1 correspondence between images and their noisy counterparts in the latent space. Since the ODE is reversible and the initial noisy images are sampled randomly, the volume of an image's projected area represents the probability of generating those images. We examined the ODE, which projects images to latent space, and succeeded in quantifying the ease of reproducing training data by measuring the volume growth rate in this process. Given the relatively low computational complexity of this method, it allows us to enhance the quality of training data by detecting and modifying the easily memorized training samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extreme Precipitation Nowcasting using Multi-Task Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14103v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have achieved remarkable progress in precipitation prediction. However, they still face significant challenges in accurately capturing spatial details of radar images, particularly in regions of high precipitation intensity. This limitation results in reduced spatial localization accuracy when predicting radar echo images across varying precipitation intensities. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative precipitation prediction approach termed the Multi-Task Latent Diffusion Model (MTLDM). The core idea of MTLDM lies in the recognition that precipitation radar images represent a combination of multiple components, each corresponding to different precipitation intensities. Thus, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing radar images into several sub-images based on their precipitation intensities and individually modeling these components. During the prediction stage, MTLDM integrates these sub-image representations by utilizing a trained latent-space rainfall diffusion model, followed by decoding through a multi-task decoder to produce the final precipitation prediction. Experimental evaluations conducted on the MRMS dataset demonstrate that the proposed MTLDM method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a Critical Success Index (CSI) improvement of 13-26%.</p></details> | 15 pages, 14figures |

Despite human hand synthesis already being an intricate problem, generating objects in contact with hands and their interactions presents an even more challenging task, especially when the objects exhibit obvious variations in size and shape. To tackle these issues, we present a novel video Reenactment framework focusing on Human-Object Interaction (HOI) via an adaptive Layout-instructed Diffusion model (Re-HOLD). Our key insight is to employ specialized layout representation for hands and objects, respectively. Such representations enable effective disentanglement of hand modeling and object adaptation to diverse motion sequences. To further improve the generation quality of HOI, we design an interactive textural enhancement module for both hands and objects by introducing two independent memory banks. We also propose a layout adjustment strategy for the cross-object reenactment scenario to adaptively adjust unreasonable layouts caused by diverse object sizes during inference. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods.

In this work, we enhance video diffusion models by allowing motion control via structured latent noise sampling. This is achieved by just a change in data: we pre-process training videos to yield structured noise. Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, making it a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusion models.

This method minimizes sampling steps while preserving generation diversity and stability. Furthermore, we introduce Time Sampler, an importance sampling technique to enhance training efficiency by focusing on crucial timesteps.

| **[Hardware-Friendly Static Quantization Method for Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15077v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers for video generation have gained significant research interest since the impressive performance of SORA. Efficient deployment of such generative-AI models on GPUs has been demonstrated with dynamic quantization. However, resource-constrained devices cannot support dynamic quantization, and need static quantization of the models for their efficient deployment on AI processors. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the post-training quantization of OpenSora\cite{opensora}, a Video Diffusion Transformer, without relying on dynamic quantization techniques. Our approach employs static quantization, achieving video quality comparable to FP16 and dynamically quantized ViDiT-Q methods, as measured by CLIP, and VQA metrics. In particular, we utilize per-step calibration data to adequately provide a post-training statically quantized model for each time step, incorporating channel-wise quantization for weights and tensor-wise quantization for activations. By further applying the smooth-quantization technique, we can obtain high-quality video outputs with the statically quantized models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that static quantization can be a viable alternative to dynamic quantization for video diffusion transformers, offering a more efficient approach without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correcting Deviations from Normality: A Reformulated Diffusion Model for Multi-Class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19357v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have spurred research into their application for Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection. However, these methods may struggle with maintaining structural integrity and recovering the anomaly-free content of abnormal regions, especially in multi-class scenarios. Furthermore, diffusion models are inherently designed to generate images from pure noise and struggle to selectively alter anomalous regions of an image while preserving normal ones. This leads to potential degradation of normal regions during reconstruction, hampering the effectiveness of anomaly detection. This paper introduces a reformulation of the standard diffusion model geared toward selective region alteration, allowing the accurate identification of anomalies. By modeling anomalies as noise in the latent space, our proposed Deviation correction diffusion (DeCo-Diff) model preserves the normal regions and encourages transformations exclusively on anomalous areas. This selective approach enhances the reconstruction quality, facilitating effective unsupervised detection and localization of anomaly regions. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method in accurately identifying and localizing anomalies in complex images, with pixel-level AUPRC improvements of 11-14% over state-of-the-art models on well known anomaly detection datasets.

In particular, diffusion models represent fine-scale details without spatial smoothing, which is crucial for mesoscale predictions, such as heavy rainfall forecasting. However, the applications of diffusion models to mesoscale prediction remain limited. To address this gap, this study proposes an architecture that combines a diffusion model with Swin-Unet as a deterministic model, achieving mesoscale predictions while maintaining flexibility. The proposed architecture trains the two models independently, allowing the diffusion model to remain unchanged when the deterministic model is updated. Comparisons using the Fractions Skill Score and power spectral analysis demonstrate that incorporating the diffusion model leads to improved accuracy compared to predictions without it. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed architecture to enhance mesoscale predictions, particularly for strong rainfall events, while maintaining flexibility.</p></details> |  |

Existing diffusion models struggle with scaling beyond their training resolutions, often leading to structural distortions or content repetition. Reference-based methods address the issues by upsampling a low-resolution reference to guide higher-resolution generation. However, they face significant challenges: upsampling in latent space often causes manifold deviation, which degrades output quality. On the other hand, upsampling in RGB space tends to produce overly smoothed outputs. To overcome these limitations, LSRNA combines Latent space Super-Resolution (LSR) for manifold alignment and Region-wise Noise Addition (RNA) to enhance high-frequency details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating LSRNA outperforms state-of-the-art reference-based methods across various resolutions and metrics, while showing the critical role of latent space upsampling in preserving detail and sharpness.

To reduce the data requirements, a natural solution is to leverage existing data-free static avatar generation methods, such as pre-trained diffusion models with score distillation sampling (SDS), which align avatars with pseudo ground-truth outputs from the diffusion model. However, directly distilling 4D avatars from video diffusion often leads to over-smooth results due to spatial and temporal inconsistencies in the generated video. To address this issue, we propose Zero-1-to-A, a robust method that synthesizes a spatial and temporal consistency dataset for 4D avatar reconstruction using the video diffusion model. Specifically, Zero-1-to-A iteratively constructs video datasets and optimizes animatable avatars in a progressive manner, ensuring that avatar quality increases smoothly and consistently throughout the learning process. This progressive learning involves two stages: (1) Spatial Consistency Learning fixes expressions and learns from front-to-side views, and (2) Temporal Consistency Learning fixes views and learns from relaxed to exaggerated expressions, generating 4D avatars in a simple-to-complex manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Zero-1-to-A improves fidelity, animation quality, and rendering speed compared to existing diffusion-based methods, providing a solution for lifelike avatar creation.

We introduce BADGR, a novel diffusion model that jointly performs reconstruction and bundle adjustment (BA) to refine poses and layouts from a coarse state, using 1D floor boundary predictions from dozens of images of varying input densities. Unlike a guided diffusion model, BADGR is conditioned on dense per-entity outputs from a single-step Levenberg Marquardt (LM) optimizer and is trained to predict camera and wall positions while minimizing reprojection errors for view-consistency. The objective of layout generation from denoising diffusion process complements BA optimization by providing additional learned layout-structural constraints on top of the co-visible features across images. These constraints help BADGR to make plausible guesses on spatial relations which help constrain pose graph, such as wall adjacency, collinearity, and learn to mitigate errors from dense boundary observations with global contexts. BADGR trains exclusively on 2D floor plans, simplifying data acquisition, enabling robust augmentation, and supporting variety of input densities. Our experiments and analysis validate our method, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art pose and floor plan layout reconstruction with different input densities.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the commonly studied scenarios involving a single human or hand interacting with one object, we address a more generic multi-body setting with arbitrary numbers of humans, hands, and objects. This complexity introduces significant challenges in synchronizing motions due to the high correlations and mutual influences among bodies. To address these challenges, we introduce SyncDiff, a novel method for multi-body interaction synthesis using a synchronized motion diffusion strategy. SyncDiff employs a single diffusion model to capture the joint distribution of multi-body motions. To enhance motion fidelity, we propose a frequency-domain motion decomposition scheme. Additionally, we introduce a new set of alignment scores to emphasize the synchronization of different body motions. SyncDiff jointly optimizes both data sample likelihood and alignment likelihood through an explicit synchronization strategy. Extensive experiments across four datasets with various multi-body configurations demonstrate the superiority of SyncDiff over existing state-of-the-art motion synthesis methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces \textit{S-DiT}, a TTS system featuring an innovative sparse alignment algorithm that guides the latent diffusion transformer (DiT). Specifically, we provide sparse alignment boundaries to S-DiT to reduce the difficulty of alignment learning without limiting the search space, thereby achieving high naturalness. Moreover, we employ a multi-condition classifier-free guidance strategy for accent intensity adjustment and adopt the piecewise rectified flow technique to accelerate the generation process. Experiments demonstrate that S-DiT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS speech quality and supports highly flexible control over accent intensity. Notably, our system can generate high-quality one-minute speech with only 8 sampling steps. Audio samples are available at https://sditdemo.github.io/sditdemo/.</p></details> |  |

The synthetic generation of cell topology enables realistic simulations of complex tissue environments, enhances downstream tasks by augmenting training data, aligns more closely with pathologists' domain knowledge, and offers new opportunities for controlling and generalizing the tumor microenvironment. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates topological constraints into a diffusion model to improve the generation of realistic, contextually accurate cell topologies. Our method refines the simulation of cell distributions and interactions, increasing the precision and interpretability of results in downstream tasks such as cell detection and classification. To assess the topological fidelity of generated layouts, we introduce a new metric, Topological Frechet Distance (TopoFD), which overcomes the limitations of traditional metrics like FID in evaluating topological structure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating multi-class cell layouts that capture intricate topological relationships.

| **[On Diffusion Modeling for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18593v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Known for their impressive performance in generative modeling, diffusion models are attractive candidates for density-based anomaly detection. This paper investigates different variations of diffusion modeling for unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection. In particular, we find that Denoising Diffusion Probability Models (DDPM) are performant on anomaly detection benchmarks yet computationally expensive. By simplifying DDPM in application to anomaly detection, we are naturally led to an alternative approach called Diffusion Time Estimation (DTE). DTE estimates the distribution over diffusion time for a given input and uses the mode or mean of this distribution as the anomaly score. We derive an analytical form for this density and leverage a deep neural network to improve inference efficiency. Through empirical evaluations on the ADBench benchmark, we demonstrate that all diffusion-based anomaly detection methods perform competitively for both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. Notably, DTE achieves orders of magnitude faster inference time than DDPM, while outperforming it on this benchmark. These results establish diffusion-based anomaly detection as a scalable alternative to traditional methods and recent deep-learning techniques for standard unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings.</p></details> |  |

After pre-training on enormous unlabeled data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a zeroth-order informed fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The zeroth-order gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with the lower variance than other methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of the RLR. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation tasks to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present ISPDiffuser, a diffusion-based decoupled framework that separates the RAW-to-sRGB mapping into detail reconstruction in grayscale space and color consistency mapping from grayscale to sRGB. Specifically, we propose a texture-aware diffusion model that leverages the generative ability of diffusion models to focus on local detail recovery, in which a texture enrichment loss is further proposed to prompt the diffusion model to generate more intricate texture details. Subsequently, we introduce a histogram-guided color consistency module that utilizes color histogram as guidance to learn precise color information for grayscale to sRGB color consistency mapping, with a color consistency loss designed to constrain the learned color information. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed ISPDiffuser outperforms state-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually.

Given that it is infeasible to directly train a model on 'whole' images from domains with potential gigapixel sizes, diffusion-based generative methods have focused on synthesizing small, fixed-size patches extracted from these images. However, generating small patches has limited applicability since patch-based models fail to capture the global structures and wider context of large images, which can be crucial for synthesizing (semantically) accurate samples. To overcome this limitation, we present ZoomLDM, a diffusion model tailored for generating images across multiple scales. Central to our approach is a novel magnification-aware conditioning mechanism that utilizes self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings and allows the diffusion model to synthesize images at different 'zoom' levels, i.e., fixed-size patches extracted from large images at varying scales. ZoomLDM synthesizes coherent histopathology images that remain contextually accurate and detailed at different zoom levels, achieving state-of-the-art image generation quality across all scales and excelling in the data-scarce setting of generating thumbnails of entire large images. The multi-scale nature of ZoomLDM unlocks additional capabilities in large image generation, enabling computationally tractable and globally coherent image synthesis up to $4096 \times 4096$ pixels and $4\times$ super-resolution. Additionally, multi-scale features extracted from ZoomLDM are highly effective in multiple instance learning experiments.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose BEVDiffuser, a novel diffusion model that effectively denoises BEV feature maps using the ground-truth object layout as guidance. BEVDiffuser can be operated in a plug-and-play manner during training time to enhance existing BEV models without requiring any architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate BEVDiffuser's exceptional denoising and generation capabilities, which enable significant enhancement to existing BEV models, as evidenced by notable improvements of 12.3\% in mAP and 10.1\% in NDS achieved for 3D object detection without introducing additional computational complexity.

We propose Self-Cross Diffusion Guidance to penalize the overlap between cross-attention maps and the aggregated self-attention map. Compared to previous methods based on self-attention or cross-attention alone, our guidance is more effective in eliminating subject mixing. What's more, our guidance addresses subject mixing for all relevant patches beyond the most discriminant one, e.g., the beak of a bird. For each subject, we aggregate self-attention maps of patches with higher cross-attention values. Thus, the aggregated self-attention map forms a region that the whole subject attends to. Our training-free method boosts the performance of both Unet-based and Transformer-based diffusion models such as the Stable Diffusion series. We also release a similar subjects dataset (SSD), a challenging benchmark, and utilize GPT-4o for automatic and reliable evaluation.

Noticeably absent from the literature is a systematic exploration of the stability of the solutions generated by these ML approaches. Here, a recurrent network is introduced that matches precisely the evaluation of a multistep method paired with a collocation method for approximating spatial derivatives in the advection diffusion equation. This allows for two things: 1) the use of traditional tools for analyzing the stability of a numerical method for solving PDEs and 2) bringing to bear efficient techniques of ML for the training of approximations for the action of (spatial) linear operators. Observations on impacts of varying the large number of parameters in even this simple linear problem are presented. Further, it is demonstrated that stable solutions can be found even where traditional numerical methods may fail.</p></details> |  |

The target is defined by a segmentation mask and the desired action is described via a text prompt. Unlike existing controllable image-to-video diffusion models that often rely on dense structural or motion cues to guide the actor's movements toward the target, our target-aware model requires only a simple mask to indicate the target, leveraging the generalization capabilities of pretrained models to produce plausible actions. This makes our method particularly effective for human-object interaction (HOI) scenarios, where providing precise action guidance is challenging, and further enables the use of video diffusion models for high-level action planning in applications such as robotics. We build our target-aware model by extending a baseline model to incorporate the target mask as an additional input. To enforce target awareness, we introduce a special token that encodes the target's spatial information within the text prompt. We then fine-tune the model with our curated dataset using a novel cross-attention loss that aligns the cross-attention maps associated with this token with the input target mask. To further improve performance, we selectively apply this loss to the most semantically relevant transformer blocks and attention regions. Experimental results show that our target-aware model outperforms existing solutions in generating videos where actors interact accurately with the specified targets. We further demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream applications: video content creation and zero-shot 3D HOI motion synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is available at https://taeksuu.github.io/tavid/</p></details> |

This computational burden primarily arises from the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video resolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality or necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are pre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these low-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading performance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free framework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead while preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high denoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and final stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To mitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution transition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage. We evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where extensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to 3$\times$ for image generation and 2.5$\times$ for video generation, all while maintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling process across multiple evaluation metrics.

Current leading methods tend to treat V2IR as a conventional image-to-image synthesis challenge, often overlooking these specific issues. To address this, we introduce DiffV2IR, a novel framework for image translation comprising two key elements: a Progressive Learning Module (PLM) and a Vision-Language Understanding Module (VLUM). PLM features an adaptive diffusion model architecture that leverages multi-stage knowledge learning to infrared transition from full-range to target wavelength. To improve V2IR translation, VLUM incorporates unified Vision-Language Understanding. We also collected a large infrared dataset, IR-500K, which includes 500,000 infrared images compiled by various scenes and objects under various environmental conditions. Through the combination of PLM, VLUM, and the extensive IR-500K dataset, DiffV2IR markedly improves the performance of V2IR. Experiments validate DiffV2IR's excellence in producing high-quality translations, establishing its efficacy and broad applicability. The code, dataset, and DiffV2IR model will be available at https://github.com/LidongWang-26/DiffV2IR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://diffv2ir.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[SyncVP: Joint Diffusion for Synchronous Multi-Modal Video Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18933v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future video frames is essential for decision-making systems, yet RGB frames alone often lack the information needed to fully capture the underlying complexities of the real world. To address this limitation, we propose a multi-modal framework for Synchronous Video Prediction (SyncVP) that incorporates complementary data modalities, enhancing the richness and accuracy of future predictions. SyncVP builds on pre-trained modality-specific diffusion models and introduces an efficient spatio-temporal cross-attention module to enable effective information sharing across modalities. We evaluate SyncVP on standard benchmark datasets, such as Cityscapes and BAIR, using depth as an additional modality. We furthermore demonstrate its generalization to other modalities on SYNTHIA with semantic information and ERA5-Land with climate data. Notably, SyncVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, even in scenarios where only one modality is present, demonstrating its robustness and potential for a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  |
